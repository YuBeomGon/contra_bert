I have a very annoying dog that is an 80 pound hound dog. We have been using this almost every time he is outside for about 3-4 months. He still barks (as it doesn't seem to have phased him with learning) but he stops after a few barks (it gradually increases in intensity).,dogs,3
"My biggest complaint about this product is that they don't give you any guideline as to how many you should give your cat daily. I know that they can't say specifically, because it would probably depend on the issue you are trying to treat, but if they could at least say give anywhere from 10-100000 a day in general that would help out a LOT. The vet I most recently went to was the typical all about the money man who milks every person for every dime he can & quite frankly shouldn't have been working with cats in the first place (he was obviously uncomfortable handling them). When I asked him about fiber options the ONLY thing he recommended was a Science Diet food that he was getting high dollar paid for selling (they are known for pushing that brand at their office) I had to research on my own to find these treats & when I called them about possibly getting an idea of how many to feed daily of course they had no idea. All I can say about most vets these days is one word- GREED!My cat likes the treats- she will eat pretty much any treat though so this was no surprise. I don't know if they are working properly because I got them to help her go to the bathroom more often due to her anal gland issues but so far I haven't noticed if they are doing anything for her.",cats,2
"I first acquired one of these toys as a gift last year to our mini Dachshund, Dexter. He literally would not play with any other toy. We would play fetch for an hour or more at a time with this toy. He even played with it long after the squeak had been ""chewed silent"". I ran across a similar toy in the grocery store recently, and the same thing happened. When that toy began to show wear, I could not find any more in stores, so I went to Amazon. The vendor had four left, and I bought three of them.I know that enjoyment of a toy is an individual thing with dogs, but Dexter, for one, absolutely loves these toys. The squeak realy gets his attention, and he loves to fetch it. After a time, though, he is content to play with it by himself. Dex is also a bit of a chewer, and these toys last days longer than anything else.",dogs,3

I purchased this in late 2011 because my 1 cat will only drink from the faucet. I figured this would be the fresh water effect I needed. I took completely apart at least 1x a week but rinsed it out every day. I scrubbed it and rinsed the filter as well. In May 2012 I noticed some brown fleks floating in the water. The filter was brand new...only used it for about 2 weeks. I pulled it out and it was completely covered in a brown sludge! I was disgusted!! Took it apart and even used a bottle brush to get into whatever areas I could. Again the fleks showed up...again washed it thoroughly. This happened several times. I noticed there is a narrow area that is very slim that nothing can fit in. Apparently it builds up a mold or something. I am so frustrated since I took it thoroughly apart every week and let it dry for almost 24 hrs before putting it back together again. I refuse to use it because now I am afraid my cats will get a bacteria from it. This is the 2nd one I purchased. The first one which I THOUGHT was great...except about a month after purchasing started noticing my floor was getting wet. I am so glad I didnt put it directly on the rug..but on a rubber mat underneath. The entire thing was leaking!! I would NOT recommend this.,cats,2
Amazon had by far the best price around on the 6 pack of Feline Frontline. Saved me over $35 as compared to veterinary prices.,cats,2
"My boxer LOVED this toy when she got it! She was gentle with it and just carried it around, content to listen to the music. But 24 hours later, the music has completely died and you can tell how sad she is that her favorite toy doesn't work anymore. This was just from gentle play and pushing the music box maybe 30 times at most. It's a shame they didn't use the same sound box that the Mr. Bill dog toy has--three years later (of rough play), he's still going strong! This toy let me down and I'm not sure I will get it for her again next year because of the disappointment level and also it's too expensive for one day's use of play.",dogs,3
"This time, I bought two. I bought one the first time and my cats had to take turns playing with them. Another low-overhead, high-productivity invention. My cats LOVE this toy. It is so comfortable for me because I don't have to move it around. All I do is straighten the wire a bit, turn it upside down so the end is facing up, and let the cats swat at it all day. They like the bouncing up action and I think it reminds them of a flying bug because my one cat starts clinking his teeth together and that means he's ready to attack some prey. I believe their verticals have improved about 12"" since we've purchased this toy. For such a low price, this is the only toy you need - ever - for an interactive playtime that will exhaust your cat until he gives up and slumps down to a deep sleep.",cats,2
"I was a little hesitant about buying it because there were mixed reviews about the item. It is easy to setup and once you follow the directions ON THE BOX it will remove the toxins from your water. I had it running for about 3 hours after receiving it and there was already brown mucky skimmate in the collection cup. The trick is to have the downflow on first before turning on the airstone so the bubbles mix more with the water. Also there is a line telling you where the bubbles are supposed to be, and where the water level is supposed to be. I highly recommend this product.",fish aquatic pets,4
"My dogs love this bed. They use the raised area around the pad for a pillow. They are very comfortable. The bed is washable too,",dogs,3
I have had the Original Drinkwell for maybe 8 - 10 years ! It has been running continuosly and never failed ! ! I have also had other fountains which have failed and quit ! I always tried to keep 2 going because I had 4 cats but last year when again the 2nd one (another brand) quit I purchased the reserve tank for the Drinkwell and true to the Drinkwell it has worked out very well with no problems whatsoever ! I would definitely recommend this fountain and the reserve tank ! I will be purchasing another set to keep on hand should this one one day quit !IT also cleans very easily !!!!! Great fountain !!!! I hope that this Orig Drinkwell fountain continues to always be available ! !,cats,2
"I bought this product because my dog has been pulling relentlessly for years, impervious to the choke chain (which I hate, too). With this harness, it's almost like she doesn't notice that she is being restrained when she tries to pull. Her power just gets diverted and it doesn't seem to bother her. A little confusing to put on, but other than that, no complaints.",dogs,3
"KEEPS CATS HAPPY & KEEPS THEM HEALTHY. A+Excellent product, I have had it for nearly two years now.With two adopted feral kittens (now both nearly 3), I had a few tasks at hand to say the least. One of them was that the cats wouldn't drink water out of a bowl without putting their paws in it and splashing it all over the floor first. Fun times.Enter the Drinkwell Fountain.Boy cat LOVES to lick from the waterfall and Girl cat happily drinks from the bowl area. Both, quite noticeably, drink more than I've ever seen cats drink of still water in a bowl.They are healthy and happy - and I am happy! While it takes a little effort to clean thoroughly, so what? It's a great tool. I clean usually every week to sometimes (with the help of the CARBOR FILTER) every two weeks. I also appreciate the filters properties to ensure clean water.After some time I acquired the 50 oz. RESERVOIR on the end so I never have to worry for more than a few days that they won't be able to drink up to their hearts' content.Maybe some day when the motor kicks the bucket I will try the next level up if it is quieter, however I hope for some years to come to keep enjoying my current Drinkwell!",cats,2
"Unfortunately, my big chewing dog who goes through a large rawhide bone per day was absolutely not interested in this bone. I tried putting peanut butter on it -- she licked it off. I ended up sending it back and getting the large, black Kong rubber bone that allows you to put treats in either end. She loves it! Plus, it's soft enough that it doesn't bang on our hardwood floors.",dogs,3
What can I say - I love it because it works. Raise Scottish Folds. Sometimes they just need a little calming -,cats,2
"I purchased a SnuggleSafe for use in my outdoor dog's dog house. She has a pad and a sleeping bag in the house, but some nights get pretty chilly here in Tennessee. I was so pleased with the first SnuggleSafe I bought another. They retain their heat for up to 16 hours (I have found one stays hotter longer, but both stay quite warm from dusk 'till dawn). They're easy to use, and if you tuck them under the animal's blanket or comforter, you'll find the hardness of the SnuggleSafe shouldn't interfere with the animal's comfort. My dog Lady Bug (a Southern Cur, about 65 pounds) loves them and I feel comfortable knowing she has an extra source of safe warmth. I don't think I'd recommend this product for use with puppies as they have a tendency to chew anything, and the SnuggleSafe IS made of plastic. But for an adult dog, an outdoor dog or an animal who needs extra warmth to soothe old joints, I highly recommend this product. Heats in the microwave in about 5 minutes, is easy to clean and store.",cats,2
"These were made in China so not sure of the quality of them. They got stuck in my dog's mouth and he had a hard time getting it loose. When I tried to help him, he didn't want me to take it. Don't think I'll get them again.",dogs,3
"I bought this for my 5 month old Bullmastiff puppy. It is WAY smaller than it seems. Aside from that the ""Oak"" laminate came off after a few weeks. Now she is 6 months old and it is way way to small and it looks ugly. It's composite wood. Not sturdy. I would NOT recommend this to a friend.",cats,2
"Very nice warm good quality coat. Bought this coat in the Camel last year for my APBT's in XL and they are still functional, thick and in great shape after quite a bit of washing. Slush stains have always come off easily in the washer and they dry well on low heat. Lots of compliments on quality and appearance. People on the street have asked me if it's real shearling. I of course do not have the type of money to buy three 50 lb dogs real shearling coats as it's enough to keep up with their appetites, medical care, harnesses, collars, beds, grooming supplies, crates etc!2012- Coats still in great shape but maker MUST have skipped on the quality of the Velcro from the time between the first two coats I purchased and the third coat. Even with the added cost of changing the Velcro, it's still a value and a warm coat with a hoody or fleece underneath in VERY harsh Chicago winters.",dogs,3
I was very disappointed with this product after using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts and really liking the Everlasting Ball.The initial problem was screwing the two ends onto the rod. I'm not sure if there is some special trick to this or what because I spent a longer time trying to figure out how to screw it all together than it took for my dog to chew through it. The pieces don't seem to fit well together and the first time I tried to muscle the whole thing in place the end pieces cracked.One of my dogs who is admittedly a strong chewer was able to get through the ends and rod in under 15 minutes. She can pretty easily bite the rod down to the end cap and has figured out that if she licks the ends enough the two end pieces will easily pop out because they don't fit in as snuggly as the everlasting treat ends do for some reason.I would recommend skipping this and just using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts if your dog is not a really aggressive chewer.,dogs,3
My yorkies love their small little Moochie toys. They really give the squeakers a real work out and finally wear them completely out. Slip one of these in and they are up and ready for many more chews and squeaks. Reasonably priced.,dogs,3
"First of all, this thing is tiny. I got it for an insect terrarium so that was fine with me, but don't even think about trying to use it for a creature more than a couple of inches long. That said, it is quite beautiful. I was a little disappointed with the mushrooms (purple with dark blue spots, the picture makes them look a nice light blue) but have otherwise been very happy with this item.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I bought this litterbox not expecting much, and it works well. I never expected the box to be a miracle poop scooping machine, nor did I think that it would totally get rid of me having to scoop once in awhile. I think it works wonderful for the two cats I have, and it has lessoned the amount that I do have to scoop. It still needs cleaning just like anyother piece of equipment. As long as it is not overloaded with litter it works wonderful. Just don't expect a miracle poop scooping machine that is going to make your scooper obsolete.",cats,2

"I have had the Litter Robot a few weeks now and very pleased with it's performance. I did not realize that cats needed to be five lbs. in order to activate the cycle. We have a four month old kitten, so we are using it manually until she matures. She adapted to it within two days. I used the suggestions enclosed---leaving her litter box next to the Litter Robot and not cleaning it, also adding a little of her litter from her box to the Litter Robot. She went in to investigate, but didn't use the Robot until I removed her old litter box and then she took to it immediately! It is wonderful to let the Robot sift and dump----I hated that smelly job! I have added a stick-on deoderizer to the disposal box and empty once a day to keep clean. Expect that a few days to a week would be OK if I were away. Anxious to use the fully automated mode but enjoying the kitten stage. What a wonderful invention!",cats,2

"I'm typing this review one-handed because I'm using my other hand to play with my kitten, using this toy. I didn't buy this from Amazon, but I'm compelled to comment here because it's such a fun product.The banner is made from a kind of synthetic terry cloth which is very colorful, very stretchy, and very resilient. The banner is firmly attached to a flexible polycarbonate wand which gives great freedom of movement and can handle quite a bit of tension. And, as some others have mentioned, this toy stimulates your cat so much that she'll happily play with it ENTIRELY on her own, and for long periods of time.*whew* just got both hands back...And, the deciding factor",cats,2
I didn't order this off of Amazon but I did get it at my local Walmart. I recently just moved into an apartment complex so and where I didn't have a job just yet I bought this product to put on my cat so he wouldn't get fleas. I've owned my cat for ten years and never once has he had a flea. I moved into this place and three months after using this product I find a flea on my poor baby. The first time I applied this product I thought I applied it wrong because my cat was still able to get at it and try to lick it off. It caused him to froth at the mouth so I was forced to wash it all off (he sure didn't like that). I called my Vet today because I need information on fleas. My Vet told me I shouldn't be using this product because it doesn't get rid of fleas at all. She didn't say it was harmful but obviously it is. I did apply it to my cat today not reading the reviews until now. He's doing fine but that's just probably because he's a big boy (16lbs). I'm going to my vet tomorrow to get the recommended flea fix.,cats,2

"Drinkwell Pet FountainI could not be more thrilled with a product for my cats than this fountain, which not only attracts and entertains them, but has also tripled their water consumption, which cat owners know is essential for the health of their urinary tract. The motor is extremely quiet, and the sound of the water is quite soothing! It is well made, reasonably priced, and attractive. I wish I'd gotten one years ago!",cats,2
Tried this product and it did not seem to make any difference on our cats. It did smell nice however. What did work for us was the Bach Rescue Remedy which did help calm our guys.,cats,2
The cover itself seems pretty well made. But the straps to hold it in place are flimsy. I have a Ford Focus and the strap that's designed to go around the bottom portion does not do anything. So with my 70lb Doberman the cover rarely stays in place. I had to get different hooks so that the top portion would stay up. But cover is nice and thick. Would be great as a picnic or travel dog bed.,dogs,3

"I have two cats who love to destroy anything and everything that they can. I decided to use these caps as an alternative to declawing. After using this product for years now, I recommend it to any cat owners that I know. These caps will save your furniture and your sanity!

Not only is this a great product, it is also a great price!",cats,2
My lab does not try to take the squeaky balls out he just likes to play with the animal itself and carry it around. It's not a very big toy I was honestly expecting bigger but its small/medium sized.

"Loved this product. I have an 11 year foster dog who was hit by a car in Taiwan and the person who hit her just left her there and both of her hind legs were broken as a result. By the time she was found one of her legs did not heal correctly. She was sent to Los Angeles and I have been fostering her since. Due to her leg issues I cannot walk her too far and she would get depressed in my house as I walked my other dogs in my care because she could not come with us.The stroller allows me to walk her with my other dogs and I can put her out to walk and when she gets tired put her back in and that helps her a lot. The seller was really great and it came a lot faster than the estimated time that the mail carrier gives you. The cup holder is a little small and I do not think is meant to carry larger drinks like a smoothie cup but if you put a can of pepsi or something it most likely will fit. My dog did pee in it,but it is not a huge deal if a stain does occur because it will be mostly covered by the wool pad that comes with it. It literally is like a square pad that is made with the fleece or wool that dog beds are made up. Everyone loves this stroller and my dog is a lot happier!!! I would recommend this product and seller to everybody!!!",dogs,3

"My golden retriever is 10 years old and I've been through many brands of seat covers for the back seat. Some wear thin sooner than others, but most have the same problem....the straps which go around the headrest eventually break off the main hammock. What's special about this hammock is that the straps are connected to the hammock with metal clips which hook through metal grommets. Huge difference!!! I've thrown away so many covers before they were really worn out because the straps broke. I also appreciate the parts that slide between the bottom and back of the seat to help hold it in place.I did recently buy a car with leather seats, which proved to be very slippery with this cover (and most covers I've used). I solved that problem by laying my Yogitoes towel over the back seat (it has small rubber nubs on one side to hold it in place) and then placing the cover over the towel.",dogs,3

Since I started using this I have noticed that I can pet him without getting a handful of fur and there isn't dog hair all over the floors of my house. If this can take care of a husky blowing his coat it can do anything. (Literally I can brush my dog every day and get a full trash can of dead fur out every day for a month or more!) Love this too because it is non-irritating and my dog doesn't feel punished when I brush him for a long time.",cats,2
"Living in the country with three dogs and trying to keep them in the yard was nearly impossible. I thought about a chain link fence,but have a lot of rock under ground and I do mean rock!!!

My other two a Cairn Terrier and a curbstone sitter seem to catch on faster.There may be certain things that interrupt the signal but not as far as we have seen. When my Beagle see's a Deer as close as 40 feet from the bounty and won't go after it,I can defiantly say it works very well for me.As far as recommending it ,I would highly say yes!!!!!Have owned this unit 1 1/2 years now and even my neighbor is amazed at how good it works.My daughter has one for her Lab and two Boxers and they have no problems with the dogs leaving the area.If you do not have an area where you can not install a wire or just want a portable unit I highly recommend this unit.

Great for training my cane corso. He does both basic training and protection training and he exercises for at least a half hour afterwards so these are great.

"I have a 75 lb. pitbull/boxer mix, which means she loves to chew and chew HARD. My roommate and I usually make bets on how long a toy will last, which is generally between 10 minutes and 10 days. Most toys for ""aggressive"" chewers last a few days at best. So far, this toy has lasted 2 weeks and is going strong. It doesn't have any chunks or pieces bitten out of it. It barely even has any marks on it. It's rubbery, so I don't need to worry about it hurting her teeth. At first, I thought she might not be interested in it given that it doesn't have any squeakers, but she loved it from the moment we gave it to her. In my opinion, this toy was well worth the price, and I'd recommend it to anyone with a dog who is an ""aggressive"" chewer.",dogs,3

If I would give this to a dog it would have to be a Tea Cup dog....even then I'd be very cautious!,dogs,3
"In short, my 17 old cat just completely ignores it, and 7-year old cat just barely notices there is some sound but it does not prevent him to do what he intended to do. Wasted money!",dogs,3
Missie is a therapy dog and gets bathed at least once per week. This shampoo doesn't dry out her skin or bother her eyes. The shampoo cleans thoroughly and rinses out quickly. I have used this product for over 3 years.,cats,2
The material is very nice. XXL is good size for our bullmastiff except the belly strap is way too big. I had to put a new piece of velcro farther up on the body of the coat to make it fit. I would recommend this product.,dogs,3
"Hi all, I have recently purchased this product for my parakeet, so I can have him in a shower with me now, I need to only make him take a shower though, he is still pretty new and doesnt seem to find interest in it yet.. hope that changes soon.. I love this product, its not heavy, it sticks really well, you can move it around, parakeet sits well on it.. perfect for a budgie or conure or so.. probably not long enough or big enough for a big parrot.. Always happy with amazon, fast shipping and things are in a great condition when I recieve them.. my favorite purchasing website..",birds,0
"I read various reviews of the Petmate Fountain before I bought it, but my sister had the smaller version and she was very happy with hers. So I went ahead and bought the jumbo version for my two cats. We've had it for about 4 weeks now, and it's been great! I don't find it hard to clean, or to refill. My one cat loved it immediately, but it took the other a few days to get used to the running water and the noise. It's not noisy by any means, but it sounds like exactly what it is...a fountain! My husband and I travel a lot on the weekends, so it's great to not have to worry about them running out of water, or it getting stale. I am happy that I went with the Jumbo size b/c I think I would have been refilling it much too often if I had gotten something smaller...so if you have two adult cats, I definitely recommend the Jumbo.",cats,2
"I bought this product to occupy my 13-month-old mix. She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough. When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour. At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces. While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does. Especially for eleven dollars!",dogs,3
I really like these. They work very well in my fish tank and I would recommend them. They are much more flat than others I have bought so it made it easier to cover them in the tank.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I bought this to put under the banket of our outside dog. she loves it. I would recommend the cover for it though. It stays warm outside for about 8-10hrs. we actually have 2 of them and are very pleased that we don't have to plug it in, but she can still be warm. I would recommend it to any pet owner.",cats,2
"I am totally happy with this crate. It came together eaisly and the latches line up perfectly and are easily operated. I was impressed that even with such a small dog crate, how heavy duty it is. We hasd previously purchased another crate from a local pet store and its a piece of junk compared to this one. You'll be happy with the Midwest Life Stages Crate.",dogs,3
My 3 month Eskie loves these treats. We use them for training and they are the perfect size and easy to break up for smaller dogs. I have used both the chicken and peanut butter flavors. He can't get enough of them!,dogs,3
"Pill Pockets are a great idea. Both the cats and dog think they are getting a tasty treat and the pill goes down quite easily. They come for their ""treat"".",cats,2
"I am surprised at how durable this cover is as it has held up all winter to serious wind, snow, and ice. The ties that came with it are junk and broke with the first gust of wind but I replaced with small bungees and they are doing much better. I use this over a kennel for my chicken run to keep them safe from hawks.",dogs,3
"My Siberian Husky is only 8 weeks old but she will definitely still have enough space to rest and move around and stretch a bit in this crate if we ever take her out to some family trip. I even fit inside! It is light weight and MUCH more open looking than a cage crate. I would recommend everyone to get these type of crates rather than the cage crates because the cage crates make your pets look like they are in jail and it will also make your house look cluttered. I am glad a took a chance in purchasing this crate.Yes the crate is big, but you will definitely need it if you live in an apartment with a any dog that is going to be big as a Siberian Husky or for other purposes such as having a baby pup or adopted an adult dog (untrained) until you train them better to be independent.Happy Crate Hunting!",dogs,3
"We bought this product for our Lab and Cat to share, our cat needs running water otherwise she does not drink enough, but our lab would drink the cats fountain dry in a matter of hours. The down side with this fountain is the bowl is extremely high, not good for a cat or a small dog, but we still use the cat's fountain in a location that the dog can't get to. The storage in the reservoir is great, I don't have to fill it but about every 3-5 days. Another bonus to a fountain is that the animals stay hydrated better, but this also means more liquids coming out so be ready for more trips outside.",dogs,3
"Good product, and the larger size is convenient, but you can get smaller ones a lot cheaper at your local store.",dogs,3
Our cats love these toys. We have wood floors so they really get to chase them around the room. The only thing to watch for is if you have a chewing dog. We have one dog who likes to chew these toys so we have to be careful that she doesn't get one.,cats,2
"This container works great for dry dog food storage. Because I placed it inside one of my lower kitchen cabinets I had to turn it over so it would fit in front of the upper shelf. It still works perfectly but it would be easier to manuever (to refill) if there were another set of recessed grips on the bottom, (which is now my top). Otherwise it's perfect.",dogs,3

"I have not noticed any difference in my dog since I started giving him this product. I do understand that different calming products don't work for every pet, it's a matter of trial and error. This was an error for my dog and I'll be trying again with a different product this month.",cats,2
"After great success with my own dog using this product, I bought it for my sister's stubborn dog who would drag her on walks. From the very minute she starting walking him with this on, he was behaved and there was no pulling. She even walked my 70 lb lab and her dog with the harnesses on them with no trouble whatsoever. GREAT PRODUCT AGAIN!",dogs,3
My vet told me about Lupine products as my dog is a chewer due to jaw issues. This is my second purchase as I had to send my first back for replacement(did not want to be without harness or leash while other was being replaced) No problems with replacement. Took less than 2 weeks for replacement. I would recommend this to anyone who has a chewer.,dogs,3
"I've used this and it worked pretty well with my Havanese dog. I just purchased more from my vet ($38.43 for 12 packs!!!). I'll never buy it from my vet again, it is 1/3rd the price on Amazon.Another vet recommend using 'Adolph's Unseasoned Tenderizer (without MSG)' instead of For-Bid. Certainly it is a lot cheaper (and has other uses), but I have not yet tried it. I do plan to use it in the future though, if problems remain.R",cats,2
"My dog has short hair but sheds. This thing barely picked up any hair, and you can't even use it on their bellies in case it tears a nipple! I sat in the yard combing her for half an hour and maybe came away with a small tuft of hairball the size of a quarter. This comb is probably meant for long-haired dogs...it definitely doesn't work on my Catahoula.",cats,2
"This toy is absolutely my Boxer puppy's favorite toy. Filled with small snacks and biscuits it becomes a treat dispenser and keeps him busy for hours. He's a heavy chewer, and hasn't put a dent in this ball. It's also large enough so there's no chance of him choking on it.",dogs,3
"My 5 month old Lab pup has chewed this in half after only 1 week. If they make it of the ""Extreme Kong"" material I'll look at them again but my pup (who has her adult teeth in now) needs a more durable product",dogs,3

"This is the recommended size for my 52 lb dog, but she quit trying to chew on it almost right away. It seems to be too large and hard for her to manage. I've also tried the next size down (Wolf) with similar disappointing results.",dogs,3
"While the product overall seemed to be high quality, I was very disappointed to learn that my 35 lb border collie bent the 'extra sturdy' wire the first day we had it, making it unable to be used any longer. I would recommend this extra large kennel for a small breed who wants lots of room, but not for any dog who shows much strength.",dogs,3
I like this collar because it realy helps us control our dogs jumping when guests are around. We don't even have to shock her. She remembers the initial shock from when we first got the collar and after that all we need to use is the warning beep. All we have to do is put this collar on her and she obeys everything we tell her!,dogs,3
I am very happy with this product. I have two tiny dogs (toy poodle & a teacup chihuahua My chi has allergies and I used this item on both dogs without any reactions or products. I have yet to encounter any problems. This is my second order from this vendor...happy happy happy a must try!,dogs,3
"My cat loves to play with it, however it came defective. The light on the ball works only sometimes. And when it does, my cat gets the best out of it. Other than that, it is very safe; no sharp edges, nothing loose, nothing to swallow. Plus the scratch pad is changeable.I contacted amazon for an exchange when I realized the light is not working properly. They send me a shipping label for the return but in the meantime my husband got rid of the packaging, so I decided to keep it. Customer service and the product is great. I am only giving it a four stars because of this defect. I would recommend it to my friends and family. Just make sure everything works before throwing out the package.",cats,2

"Urgh. I had so much hope that something would control fleas this year. In past years we have had no to little problems with fleas. A mild winter has changed that. I just used the third dose of Frontline on our three dogs...having read it takes two to three months to build up and really work. Well, the fleas are worse this month than in June! So Frontline just does not work anymore. I am also feeding dogs vitamin B1, brewers yeast, and sprayed the house with Home Defense insecticide. this product is 1/2 strength of commercial pesticides so if you spray twice, it works as effectively. It did the job with ants for us. And it did seem to help greatly for about 6 weeks. I guess I need to reapply even though it claims it works for 12 months.A friend uses Trifexis on her dogs for heartworms and fleas and doesn't have any problems. The flea-controlling compound is spinosad which is sold solo in Comfortis. I have a dog on ivermectin treatment for heartworms so can't use the Trifexis. I will order Comfortis asap. I'm out of Frontline and it was a waste of money.",dogs,3
"Use as regular shampoo. Or to treat dermatitis, or mange by following the instructions on the label; to leave on for an extended 10 minutes. This way it soaks deep into your dogs' hair follicles where mange may be hiding. If it's the lesser threat of dermatitis this will definitely clear it. On my pet, just one 10 minute treatment did the trick. But for more severe cases it may take up to 2 or 3 treatments.",dogs,3

"I have two kittens that have grown quite a bit. They love to scatter the litter everywhere upon using the litter box. Without the domed litter box, the litter would get all over the floor and would require sweeping almost everyday. Since getting this new litter box, we only have to vacuum once or twice a month because of residual cat litter left on there paws over time. It controls the odor some, but like anything, you still need to keep the litter fresh and clean. I would highly recommend this cat litter to anyone having similar issues to mine. The best part is, the dome pops on and off with ease without the use of latches, hooks, etc. Great price for a useful box.",cats,2

"I have seen these products on a few fish tanks recently and had no idea what they were. After a little research, I figured this could be a great replacement for my algae brush. Within about a minute after dropping the Mag-Float into my tank, the algae on the side of the tank was gone. The product works fantastically, though my fish didn't seem to care for it.Be cautious when cleaning near your rocks at the bottom of the tank. Any particles that get caught in the magnetic pull could scratch the walls. The easiest way to counter this is to pull the portion on the outer wall away from the class and then re-attach it after a few seconds. The break in the magnetic pull should drop any caught particles between the two pieces.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I wanted a brush for my large dog's teeth. I love the small-dog CET brush, but couldn't find a large-dog brush anywhere except for these dual-head brushes. What a stupid design! You can't lay it down in a drawer without squashing the bristles on one side or the other. I put my brushes in the dishwasher and then the bottom brush gets squashed in the silverware rack. To solve the problem, I cut off the small-dog end of it with a wire cutter. Now I have a decent large-dog brush. The angle is good for a human hand to reach the curves of a dog's mouth. Everything else about the brush is great except for the dual-head business.If anyone from CET reads this, I sure wish you'd wise up and make a single-head large-dog brush just like you do for the small dogs. You're dual-end brush is probably getting your marketing dept excited, but in the real world, it's a joke. I can't understand why you make it easy for small dog owners to get a nice single-head brush, but you penalize large-dog owners.I actually have BOTH large and small dogs. I buy the small-dog single brush for the small guys. I definitely do NOT want the hassle of using and cleaning the dual-head brush.",dogs,3

"We own two dogs- each about a year and a half old. One is a boxer/lab mix and the other a lab/hound mix. Both about 50lbs and both love to take each of US for a walk (heavy pullers). We tried a regular harness- but that showed no difference in their pulling (we would always come home frustrated at the dogs insistence to pull throughout our walks). We tried a Gentle Leader with one of our dogs- and while it did make a difference (less pulling) our dog really disliked it (kept trying to paw it off and lots of head shaking)- in addition, the look of a dog on a Gentle Leader sometimes implies the dog may be aggressive (almost has a negative connotation).Finally we tried this product. While skeptical at first (it appears to look exactly like the harnesses we've owned before), we were soon proven wrong. This product is truly incredible. We can now WALK with our dogs- and they seem to be walking comfortably with us. Granted- they will pull when they know we're close to the dog park (or if a squirrel crosses our path)- but that's just excitement, and totally understood. But this product really works and we highly recommend for any dog owners with heavy pullers.",dogs,3
"I can't begin to explain why this shampoo works so fast, but it really does. I have a cat who had been suffering from dermatitis. Tried putting her on hypo-allergenic food, hypo-allergenic bedding, hypo-allergenic everything, nothing helped. Tried conditioning wipes which only helped temporarily. Finally decided to try this shampoo after hearing wonderful things about it. Let me tell you, washing a cat is not fun times. But it was so worth it. Her dermatitis cleared up and has not returned. I used the dilution instructions for the shampoo, and doing it that way worked great and will make the shampoo last a lot longer if you need it to (I haven't needed to re-use it yet). Highly, highly recommended.",dogs,3
"From the dimensions and the picture of a poodle using it, I thought sure all our 6 cats would fit through it...wrong! The larger ones could squeeze through, but they weren't happy doing it. This size is great for kittens and lean cats. If your cat is over 10 lbs. go with the next size up. On the plus side, it was very easy to install and operated quietly when in use.",cats,2

For about 6 months the product is a God-send. Especially if you use the premium scoopable litter. Nice smell and clumps in a way that the box ""likes"".

The only thing is that the squeakers didn't last more than ten minutes, and that's for all 3, but I don't mind because those things drive me nuts sometimes.

"I have used World's Greatest Litter for a couple years, and saw this on the shelves. So I decided to try it. Here was the result:1. Swheat Scoop is cheaper than World's Greatest2. Swheat Scoop is more fun to say.3. Swheat Scoop is less dusty than World's GreatestNow for the bad part:1. I am very allergic to the dust Swheat Scoop causes2. The clumping sticks like glue to the bottom of the box, no matter how deep I filled it.3. The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.4. The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.5. The litter is harder, so when you step on a tiny clump with bare feet, it hurts more. Only thing more painful is Litter Pearls.So overall, I am not impressed. Your mileage may vary.",cats,2

My dogs are about 13 pounds apiece, and one stick per dog lasts at least one full day.

"This product kills fleas but it will NOT rid you of the problem. It will appear like it did, but don't be fooled!This is how I got rid of my INFESTATION 1 year ago:PART A:1. Give Capstar and have cat wait while cat is in your tub with about 2 inches of water only. Your cat will hate it. However, dead fleas will drop and the 2 inches will work as a ""double tap"" from Zombieland. Live fleas will try to ""escape"" and will drown. This way they won't spread in your home. Wait for like 10 minutes and then let the water go down the drain.2. Get a huge pot or container to use as your ""kitty bath"". Make sure it's ready to go before you start. Combine vinegar, some flea shampoo, and warm water. Have it ready! Have a small plastic cup. Dunk your cat's body in the kitty bath BUT NOT THE HEAD. The noise of running water might freak out your cat so it's best to just have additional warm water at hand to pour over it with your cup.3. Lather your furry one with flea shampoo. Careful with the eyes.4. Pick off all the fleas you can find. This step sucks but you have to do it. Don't pop them, just have a bowl of soapy water to drown them. Pick, stick your hand deep in the bowl, and let go. When I was ""done"" that bowl was FULL of dead fleas.5. Rinse. Repeat steps 3 and 4. This time pay extra attention to the face and under the chin/neck, butt, tail. Fleas are not totally dumb and will rush to that safe area that hasn't been dunked and to the extremities. This will be hard and your back might hurt but you have to get through it.6. Make sure your cat is not cold. Keep the temperature nice, as soon as you pull your cat from the water roll it up in a towel. Once that towel has absorbed a lot of water, get a new towel. Put a hair dryer on low and begin to warm up/dry your furry friend.I did all of part A at least 2 times with each cat. Btw don't use the same nasty water and wait at least 3 days to give them another pill! Yes, I got scratched and smelled like wet cat. Yes, I was tired and almost gave up. Yes, one of my cats pooped in my bath tub.PART B:1. Get Orvitrol Spray and have it ready4. Shave your cat. DON'T SHAVE THE WHISKERS. But Yes. Shave it. Even if it's a short hair breed. Trust me. Shave your cat. Have someone help you hold it down as you work. Get some groomer gloves if you need to. If it's a long hair cat first cut the hair with scissors and then shave away the rest. Spray the fur with Orvitrol and bag it up. Dispose. There will be fleas in the fur that drops to the ground.3. Salt (that's right, I salted our ENTIRE apartment except our bed, appliances, and counter tops. Works just like borax, except it won't be toxic for your cats when they lick their coat). This will be SO annoying. But it really does help. The salt pierces the flea skin and they bleed to death. You will feel like a crazy person. You will be exhausted after part A. Let the salt sit as long as you possibly can stand it. I could only take 4 days. Then vacuum it all up. Immediately dispose of the bag. If you have a bagless one make sure you throw all the junk out and clean it well. I felt like I was in a weird combination of hell and the North Pole. My apartment was white. I had salt under my nails.4. DIY flea/insect traps. Place shallow pans of water with a drop of dish soap all over your home. Believe it or not this will trap more than just fleas. I used those big disposable aluminum pans and other random objects. Your cats will not be stupid enough to drink this water as long as they have fresh clean water available to them.5. Wash all bedding/clothes/etc. Add vinegar to your laundry detergent.6. Orvitrol your bed, couch, drawers, curtains, closets, and all those comfy cat areas. You might have to keep your cats in one room of the house for a while.1. Monitor your cat daily. Pick fleas, and drown them in a bowl! You need to look hard but you have to do it. Give them another kitty flea bath as needed.PART C:1. Begin to put a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar in your cat's drinking water (the organic type with the little brown flakes or ""mother"" in it). I have 2 cats and the other one refused to drink the water. I used a plastic syringe (without the needle) and put it at the side of it's mouth (near the back). Slowly squirted some and the cat drank by reflex. This will fight fleas and also has a bunch of other health benefits. Continue doing this.2. Get a good spot treatment like Advantage. Don't waste your time with those cheap Walmart types.3. Do a flea bath every 4 months for prevention. My cats hated water at first but they grow more and more used to it each time.Sorry for any typos, it's 3 am and I felt like helping someone out!",cats,2
"Our issue with barking was probably different than most. Our dogs sleep downstairs confined to a couple of rooms. On the days when we could sleep late, one of the dogs would bark until someone came down but it was NOT to be let out, just companionship. I selected this product because it was recommended by our vet and it works like a charm. Within 2 days he no longer barks in the mornings. We take it off as soon as we come down because he also barks to be let in and we don't need to discourage that.",dogs,3
"I bought this to try to control my neighbors neglected dog that is left outside most of the day, and barks at anyone, or anything that it hears, or sees throughout the day including my family whenever we're in our backyard.As stated in another review this unit looks as if it has 4 speakers, but actually only the bottom 2 speakers work, the other 2 must have been put there to make the unit look more powerful than their lower priced model the Lentek Bark Free Pro, but in all reality as stated on the Lentek web page, the lower priced Lentek Bark Free Pro model actually has a larger coverage area.The description on Amazon and many other sites say it has a 50ft range, but the mfg says it will only cover up to 20 ft.It will detect a bark from 50', but if it's coverage area is only 20' so what good is that?.http://www.lentek.com/Main/Main.asp?SubCategoryID=31&CategoryID;=8&As for the product itself, I'm using it through a 6' stockade fence which the mfg doesn't reccomend, but I have the speakers placed so that they let the sound go through the spaces between the slats(I hung it sidways).I did notice at first the dog was startled by the sound, but I'm begining to think she's getting used to it, as she's back to my side of the yard again, and doesn't really seem to get bothered when the thing goes off.It has been a little more quiet throughout the day when we are inside so the boredom barking has gone down a little, so I will give the unit credit for that.I paid 48.00 shipped, it comes with a 50' power cord, and will also uses 4 d batteries.Not many positive reviews to be found on any of theese ultrasonic bark deterrents, but the fake speaker thing, and the lower coverage range makes me wonder about this company.One would think that coverage would be an important feature.I guess Lentek knows most people looking at theese products are in dire need of a resolution so they add ""Super"" + 20 bucks, and make it look more technically advanced, thinking that desperate people will jump on it,just like myself.For 25 dollars I'd have no problem keeping this unit, but for 50 I'll see how it goes, and maybe return.I only give it 2 stars because the mfgs attempt at misleading consumers, otherwise I'd give it 3 since it does seem to work a little.Not exactly as good as I hoped, but even a little is something.I have seen a few positive reviews for the bird house unit, so if I return this one I will give that one a shot, even though it's a few more dollars.",dogs,3

Our cat loves it, used it right away after we move the litter box inside.

"I recently purchased two chinchillas from off of Craigslist(Fidget and Gidget ""formerly Moe and Chicka"" or as I call them Mr. and Mrs. Chinson lol)and they came with this cage. I think it's kind of small for chinchillas and it doesn't have any ledges. It's just okay, the chins have a large rabbit igloo, quick-loc crock, and a hay cage inside and they can still jump around a bit. I put in some chew sticks and paper towel tubes for them to chew on.Also, it seems pretty durable(the chinchillas have chewed on the base and it does have marks and dings but so far no escapes. They chewed off the two side latches so I guess the people I bought them from poked holes in the base and secured it to the top with heavy twist-ties. It has been through heck and back but it serves its purpose... containment! I let the chins have playtime outside the cage everyday so I think it'll be fine for now!",small animals,5

I have 2 littermaids that have been nothing but trouble . Years ago they seemed better . I tried this as I have 4 cats and tired of the Littermaids getting stuck . It really is amazing . I have 2 and they have been using them about 2 months now so easy to change . And the cats took to it no problem . I bought a 6 pk of refills but $ 99 is terrible for a cardboard tray and 4 1/2 pds of litter . I bought the forever trays but am having trouble finding the litter .I couldn't find it online anywhere. Finally found at Target . $13.59 for a 8 lb bag. One bag should do the 2 boxes .I hope it continues to work flawlessly as it has saved me alot of work . Give it a try . Would rate a 5 but expensive litter trays .,cats,2
"I bought this for my Cairn terrier for a stocking stuffer for christmas, it just showed up and I am shocked at its size. This toy is smaller then cat toys I have purchased! I am almost afraid to give it to her in fear or her swallowing it because it is that small. I would have expected this from the extra small size but not the small, but thats what I get for not reading the detail product dimensions. All in all, this toy is worth maybe $0.25 at best! It states that this is for dogs between 10-25 pounds, I would say it is for 10lbs and under and even that is pushing it.",dogs,3

"I have a 3yr old golden who has alot of fur between her toes and during our daily walks in the snowy weather would develop ice ball between the pads on her feet. She was stopping every few feet to try and remove them, obviously painful to her. The Muttlucks worked very well to correct this problem. I know she isn't too crazy about them from the look on her face as she sees them, but she has complied nicely. I was quite funny watching her try and walk at first but once she got outside she didn't seem to care. They stay on pretty well, only a few time did they fall off(once she brought it back to me like hey this fell off). You do need to pull the velcro straps pretty tight for them to stay on. I also like the reflective strips, as we do walk in the dark in the early morning on the days I work.",dogs,3
"I got this for my fluval 306 and it fits perfect . it comes with 4 black suction cups , 2 dark plastic tubes that are aprox 15"" each , a black rubber fitting to assemble the 2 tubes togeather . One of the tubes has one end capped off . I realy do not understand all the neg reviews on lack of instructions as it it childs play to assemble . You have 2 options here , assemble the the 2 tubes togeather with the included black rubber fitting ,( or use just one if you wish) then insert the 4 plastic C looking pieces into the suction cup ends , attach the suction cups to the spray bar and mount to the back of the aquarium just a little below the water line of if you prefer above the water line , it is up to you . Now remove the plastic output nozzle from the canister filter leaving the rubber adaptor connector on the ribbed hose side and connect to the spraybar open end . NOT all that hard folks and those giving the product a bad review just because of a lack of instructions I gotta wonder about.I did drill my holes a little bigger using a standard drill and a bit and it worked out fine . I mounted mine just a little below the water line with the flow pointing driectly foward to the front of the aquarium. This gives me a nice ripple effect on the surface of the water , disperses the flow across all of my 55 gal tank , and the plants gently sway in the flow . All in all I am pleased !",fish aquatic pets,4
"So much more attractive than the old VittlesVaults. Very easy to use and clean because the whole opaque lid snaps off. My dog has been know to break into garbage cans/food bags, and I've had no problem with this container. But I have known other dogs who are clever/determined enough to remove the lids from old-style VVs if the lid isn't super tightly spun shut, and I think those dogs could pretty easily remove this lid from the snap on section.",cats,2
I have been using these heated buckets for a few years now for our outside dogs. It is nice to know that they will always have water to drink no matter how cold it is. Previously I had 2 of the 10 quart size buckets and they worked well for approx. 3 winters. One developed a split in the bottom and the other one quit heating as well and ice would form when the temps hit the mid to low 20's. We only used them from late November thru late Feb to early March and then stored them the rest of the year. Again they save a lot of trouble of frequently replacing frozen water buckets to the pets and give you peace of mind that your animals will always have water. I was just disappointed in only getting 3 winters out of the first buckets we bought.,cats,2

It took less than 5 minutes to unbox, load batteries, set the current time, program for 3 feedings, and load food into the hopper. Now Monty gets 3 1/4 cup feedings per day (instead of only two feedings with much larger quantities) and he's eating smaller portions. Hopefully he'll lose weight and become a leaner healthier cat with the help of the Pet Bistro. I love the Pet Bistro because I no longer have to worry about rushing home for feedings and the portion sizes are perfectly measured. Monty has adapted nicely to the change in his feeding routine.",cats,2

"I have a one year old cat who's VERY picky about his toys. He'll usually bat at it a few times and that's the end of that! I tried squeaky toys, remote control mice, chirpy bird toys...he didn't even like Da Bird! The only things he seemed to like were cardboard boxes, rope, and crumpled paper balls. My house was starting to look like the trash can threw up because of the weird things he played with. But this? The design is simple, a multi-colored piece of felt on a stick, but he LOVES it. The instant I took it out of the package, he was at my feet and ready to play. Every time he sees it, he's all over it (I have to keep it hidden most of the time).The only complaint I had was that the stick wasn't that sturdy, and my cat has his front claws, so he would hook into it and the stick would bend dangerously. I was afraid he'd break it eventually, so I fixed it by wrapping duct tape around the handle. It ain't pretty, but Bear-cat doesn't care about the looks, and neither do I. Overall, I DEFINITELY recommend this to cat owners, especially if your kitty's picky about toys!",cats,2

The only thing that has lasted is her extreme kong and the extra large tire biter (both great toys!). She can also tug the knots out of the 4 foot ropes, so those don't last long either around here. This toy doesn't even have teeth marks in it yet! Today was also the first snow for the midwest and it was a great snow toy. It gets stuck just below the surface so the dog has to dig and look for it a little bit, but the color and density make it really easy to find if the dog can't (only happened 2 times in half hour of extreme fetch). I can't wait for the Zogoflex disc to get here! BUY THIS TOY!",dogs,3
"We have a very large, 10-month old Boxer named Murphy. He is a normal Boxer and loves to pull as he's being walked. His strength made it impossible for my 10-year old daughter to walk him or even take him outside. I knew that Boxers loved to pull and began looking for an option that would allow us to enjoy him more outside. It was during this time that I found the Easy Walk Pet Harness and placed my order.The first day I got the harness and placed it on our dog. The adjustments were simple enough that it did not take too much time to make it fit. I ordered according to Easy Walk Pet Harness' sizing chart, however, I found my ""large"" harness fit larger than I'd hoped. If I were to do it again, I would have ordered the ""med-large"" instead of the ""large."" Due to this sizing discrepancy, I had to place the fittings at their tightest position. When I did this it barely was tight enough to fit. The good-point for me is since Murphy is only 10-months; the larger size will give him room to grow. I wasn't sure how Murphy would take to the harness, but once it was on him, other than being curious, he did not act as if it bothered him much at all. I then took him outside and was amazed at the instant difference. Before, when the leash was on his collar, he would pull and jerk trying to get it to go further than the leash's 6' length. With the Easy Walk Pet Harness, he was much calmer and barely pulled against the leash at all. Next came the big test; my daughter. When she came home from school she saw the harness she wanted to try walking Murphy. For our test we went to the school across from our house. I tried Murphy first and he walked on my left side, just like he was taught in obedience school (well, he was taught, but never obeyed much afterward). I then gave the leash to my daughter. It was amazing! Murphy walked perfectly beside her...perfectly! The school yard had 10-15 kids playing in various areas. Before he would have been pulling like crazy to get to those kids (he loves to play). But with this harness, my daughter kept him on the sidewalk little effort. She now takes him for daily walks and volunteers to take him outside.I liked the results I got from this harness so much that I sent its Amazon link to my niece. She has a 3-year old Boxer that she has never been able to walk without a struggle. After seeing how well this harness worked for my big-brute, I feel confident it will work for her Boxer too.Bottom line, placing the leash attachment ring at the dog's front chest-area does give the dog owner much more control over their dog. I would buy the Easy Walk Pet Harness again without hesitation.",dogs,3

"This toy arrived Saturday and is of excellent quality. Our 12 month year old kitten played with it immediately and with all her might. The feather toy at the end of the pole is realistic to a small bird flying, as you wave the wand around. Our kitten has made some record bereaking leaps to catch the toy. This toy tires her out in minutes. After a few minutes of vigorous play, she opened her mouth wide, and her tongue was hanging out of her mouth. She then went to the kitchen to lay on the cool floor, with her limbs spread out. She then went to sleep for about 4 hours. We love playing with our kitten with this toy. You just have to remember to stop play after a few minutes and make sure your pet is not exhausted. I don't think she would know when to stop on her own because she loves the toy so much.",cats,2

"We bought this litter box to replace a non-frill open box. It is certainly an upgrade from that but our cats often skip over the steps and carry the litter out of the box nonetheless. The steps are also hard to clean without getting your hands dirty. The product is rather oddly shaped at the bottom so you can't line the bottom with a plastic bag well. Also, the interior of the dome requires cleaning fairly often as cats splash onto the dome. The air-filter is quite useless as the odor escapes from the front opening. One of our cats is quite big and from time to time will knock the top half of the dome over and splash the litter all over the place. I think for the price, you are much better off getting the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box. We also own that box and it works much better at containing the litter and also is much easier for cleaning. The only complaint that I have about that system is if you overfill the box with litter, the cats can kick the litter out of the front opening as they try to cover up their wastes.",cats,2

They would be stuck helplessly inside, and just the thought of that so tears at my heart! And I don't believe in letting them outside, because that is so incredibly dangerous too, much more than keeping them indoors, no matter where you live. At least this way, by putting these bright red stickers on a door and/or window where rescue personnel are likely to see them, telling them you have animal friends inside, what kind and how many, they can at least attempt to save their lives. It at least gives your pets a better chance for survival. And I don't know about you, but that gives me much more peace of mind. Thank you to whoever invented these!",dogs,3
"Frontline Plus was not working for our dog, a 25-27 pound mix of Sheltie and Pomeranian, so we tried Frontline Top Spot and are very pleased with the results. Our little guy's neck is prone to hot spots in the summer and with this product he has had only two, which is great compared to the dozen he had last year this time with the heat, fleas & humidity. He scratches at his neck and, well, everywhere A LOT less so there are fewer places for the hot spots to get inflamed. I'm investing in 6 mos worth, we think it is the best for our dog. Also, our walking trails have ticks and he has not had one since using this product. Highly recommend. BTW, if your dog does develop hot spots we like two products to quickly relieve the pain & itch and clear up the swelling completely (overnight)...the first is an all natural citrus spray called Bergapet Pet Spray [...] and also Dermasol Skin Care Gel.",dogs,3

I bought the catit drinking fountain over a year ago and for the past 6 months have let it sit unused. It is much harder to fill than a Drinkwell and if the angle isn't just right it only comes out of one side of the fountain....sometimes the motor is louder than other times. There is no rhyme or reason for it. You cannot clean the inside of the resevoir so I can only imagine how slimy it is. I have 8 eight cats and I have two Drinkwell Fountains already - one that I purchased in 2002 is still going. So if you want a fountain - don't go with this one. It was a complete waste of money.,cats,2

"I bought this to replace a regular 6ft leash. I got the medium version rated for 77 pound dogs since my dog is about 50 pounds and likes to pull. The retractable mechanism works really well - smooth and doesn't tangle. The 16-foot length seems just right where the dog has lots of freedom but you are still in full control.I'm glad I got the all belt version. This protects you from cutting your skin with the thin cord, feels stronger, and in my opinion looks better.The only problem I have with this product is that the handle is slightly too small for my hand. For reference I'm a 5'11 male. The grip is good size but the opening is a bit too small. It's not a serious issue but could be improved.",dogs,3
"I wish I had a video to post of my two little dogs being scatted off this mat, but I've never actually seen them get on the mats. We bought a new furniture set for the outdoor patio to replace a futon couch that our min pin and fox terrier/pom loved to nap on (and thus rendered un-guest-friendly), and we were determined to keep them off the new couch. We placed two of these, end-to-end, on the couch, but only after testing it on ourselves at the lowest setting. The &#34;shock&#34; is more surprising than it is actually painful, so we had no qualms about using it for the dogs after the people test. And though we haven't seen our boys get shocked by the mats, they must have at some point, because they do not go on the couch whatsoever. In fact, we noticed that they were so averse to even glancing at the couch, we haven't bothered to turn on the mats for about a month now, and they still avoid the couch like the plague. That's the best part, since we no longer need to keep batteries in the mat and don't get shocked ourselves when we forget the mat it still on.",dogs,3
"I love how little you use of this. I was surprised because I didn't know much about this brand but when I read the other reviewers comments about how little you use of this compared to the others, I was sold. It just makes economic sense. I think I still put too much in out of habit, so I need to work on that. It's also an easier bottle to store, which isn't something I ever considered, but I like that it fits easier in my fish box.",fish aquatic pets,4
"First of all, Tuffy toys aren't meant for dogs to sit down and chew on. They are play toys, and if used the way they're meant to be used they will last for a VERY long time. If you let your dog chew on this toy all they want, then yes, it won't last very long. My dog loves to play with this toy, it is her favorite toy and her go-to for tug-of-war. We don't let her take it away and chew on it, though we do let her squeak the squeakers and throw it around for herself. We bought it in July for her Birthday, and it's now September and she hasn't broken through the first layer. The squeakers do break pretty fast, but all it takes is for the dog to bite it the wrong way. My dog goes through cow hooves in less then a day, rawhide in 2 minutes. She is a very strong chewer. I would definitely recommend the octopus for a strong play toy for a good chewer. There is no toy that will survive a dog chewing on it all they want. If you want to give your dog something to chew on and destroy, get a hoof, rawhide strips, or a bone. If you want a great fun toy for you and your dog to play with, this is it.",dogs,3
"I read many, many reviews, before purchasing this. It IS the best. It's sturdy, handle has rubber grip and is long enough, so I don't have to BEND way over. Scoop is wide, deep and has teeth at the edge making this chore so much easier. We have two cats, and I am VERY happy I purchased this.",cats,2

This was our dogs very first toy. We got it before we brought him home at age 8 weeks. We rubbed it on all his litter mates before he left the litter. He slept with it his first nights with us. We took a picture with lambchop and our puppy when we brought them home. Our son saw the photo and thought we had two puppies rather than one. It lasted about three months with him playing with it many times daily. He uses it as a chew and a tug toy and loves that it has 5 squeakers. We now have a second one. He also loves to chase and fetch it when we throw it. It holds up well in both machine washer and dryer. The seams of the rear legs had to be repaired on the second when they came undone. The fabric on the muzzle is most prone to tearing.,dogs,3
I'm very happy with this product. It's well made and just the right height for my greyhound. We put kitty litter in the legs to weigh it down and it doesn't move. I would highly recommend.,dogs,3

My dog had a bad reaction to this device. The first time she had it on it seemed to do nothing and she barked as usual. Gradually her barking lessened but she barked once loudly and then began screaming. We tried again the next night with the same problem. This morning we gave it one last shot and after having the collar on for about 5 minutes she began screaming yet again. She had not even barked. She had been playing quietly and the collar shocked her anyway! She kept screaming and hopping around and when I finally got the collar off of her it was warm.,dogs,3
"I had heard some good things about the Nylabones so thought I'd give it a try. We have an 8 year old Golden who's a moderate chewer, and a 6 months old Golden who's a crazy chewer. Neither of them have given this &#34;bone&#34; more than 30s of attention during the last month. I think it's just to hard dull. Based on this, and all the reviewers who seems to have problem with broken molars from these bone, I wouldn't recommend them. I think natural alternatives like beef bones and hoofs are a better alternative. I also tried an edible puppy chew (the large breed variant) from Nylabone. It took our puppy literally 90s to eat the whole thing...I expected a little more for an $8 bone to say the least...",dogs,3
I've had them for 3 years. they work great. They stay on better than any I've tried. They are flexible so my dog doesn't mind having them on. Great for walks on salty sidewalks.,dogs,3
"My much adored cat started pooing outside of his box and sometimes urinating as well. His favorite spot was our bed, so this made a frustrating problem even worse. He would also sometimes use a couch downstairs. I took him to the vet to check for a UTI, which he did not have. I changed the kind of litterbox and the kind of litter to Dr. Elsey. He would only use the litter box if it was next to our bed. As this was definitely not ideal, I was at my wits end. I tried this product, mixed it into the litter box and placed the box back in its original location. I put my cat into the litter box and he was immediately intrigued by the small. He used the box right then and has been using the box with no accidents now for over two months. I would highly recommend trying this product!",cats,2

"I have a 3 lbs yorkiepoo she is only 4 months old. We bought this for travel when we go to visit family for the day. The size is small but it's ok, for a short period of time.

I defiantly wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable leaving her unsupervised (leaving the house) It&#8217;s great for now but I think it a few months she will be able to jump out.The kids lean in to pet her she get so excited she starts jumping like crazy and NOW she&#8217;s figured out her paws fit inside the gate wholes so she&#8217;s attempted to climb the gate&#8230;..

"The leash is a thin tape (1/2 an inch wide & as thick as a dime)on a retractable spring. It extends 26 feet, and self-retracts as the dog gets closer, or as you catch up to him. I was initially concerned the leash would break after being vigorously rubbed against trees, gates, walls, corners, etc, but it is strong material. Think of the stuff seat belts are made from, only thinner and narrower. This leash has been used for an 80-85 pound pit bull mix. It holds up just fine, even when he spots walking cheeseburgers (cats) in the vicinity and tries to sprint after them. I've dropped it a few times without any problems. I have several other leashes (a cord leash instead of a tape leash, a double leash for two dogs, and another tape leash) and this is the best. The other tape leash has failed after less than a month. This one has over 700 hours of use on it, and seems to have at least that much more. (roughly 6 months times 4-6 walks per day times 45-90 minutes per walk.)(edit",dogs,3

"My boyfriend and I purchased a Four Paws Deluxe Crate two years ago when we brought home our black Labrador, Mal. Ever since then it has lasted us through his potty training, nights he would whimper and whine, some attempted escapes, and travelling from AZ to PA. We absolutely love this crate! The only show of wear and tear after two years is a small crack in the bottom pan, but it barely passes the raised lip, so functionality isn't compromised one bit. Mal was about thirty pounds when we brought him home, and now he's a whopping 89, and he has more than enough room to stretch out, stand, and lay comfortably-- even though he prefers to curl up in a tight little ball all the way in the back!The latches on the crate itself are secure, and easy enough for my boyfriend's 5 year old niece to open and close when she's helping out with ""Her best friend Mal."" The entire crate is also easy to clean as well, just take it out to the yard and hose it down! Easy to assemble, and light enough for me to move on my own (and trust me, that's saying something).So naturally now that I'm bringing home a German Shepherd pup, Four Paws is our first choice for our new family members special space. No doubts about quality here, and with buying on Amazon I'm saving quite a bit on the price itself AND shipping. I definitely would recommend these crates to everyone who needs a sturdy crate for their large dogs.",dogs,3

"The crate is shipped in a box with ZERO packaging to protect it from being bent and mangled in shipping, so mine was impossible to assemble (a real disappointment). The brackets/hinges are very flimsy and were bent in addition to the whole side wall and it would've been dangerous to our puppy to put her in it! Fortunately, we already have the Iris 4 wall play pen that our now 4 month old pomeranian loves, so we didn't have to run to the local pet store after this didn't work. We still want a traditional crate for her ""downstairs"" house, and since we want the Midwest Heritage Table Top to go with it, we have to buy from Midwest in order for that to work so we're going to try the Midwest ""Select"" or Midwest ""Ultimate"" that supposedly work with the table top but were more expensive models. It also was bigger than I expected, but its hard to judge from pictures anyway. The smallest table top size is for a 24"" crate, but if not, we'd go for the smaller size crate because it looks too big for even our puppy's mom at 9lbs. I think the ""ICrate"" model is the economy priced model and it may work for some people, provided your UPS guy treats it with kid gloves...",dogs,3

The ball I got doesn't look like the picture but more like an ugly blob of plastic with a lot of molding ridges and wrinkles. For almost $12 a simple plastic ball should be more aesthetically pleasing. My dog could care less of course. For him the texture gives a good grip for his teeth and the ball is soft enough he can deform it. A red Kong ball is a lot harder. My puppy ripped the decoration off a two-color Orbee ball but this one is one piece and he does fine with it. A adult strong chewing dog would probably rip this ball up but it works ok for us.,dogs,3

I'm glad I paid the extra for a well-made leash; I know a lesser one would have failed by now.Update, 9/2012The dog has slowed down, just like me but this leash is as strong as new. If she had offspring I could hand this down for generations.",dogs,3

"I bought this product on the advice of a puppy training group member who said she wouldn't be without it. I agree. I have a torn rotator cuff and this system allows me to walk my dog without using my arms. It is very well designed so that you can attach and detach it easily, use it as a regular leash, adjust the size of the belt and the length of the leash. I am sure runners would love it and anyone who wants to have both hands free while walking the dog. It is sturdy and of good quality.",dogs,3

But this toy can keep her entertained for an hour or more. I just keep putting those little squeaky squirrels in, and she loves taking them out one by one. Has recently learned to just tip it over and give a head shake, and I think she knows that's cheating. Sometimes I substitute a tennis ball inside, which can exit from the side holes but not the top hole. Compared to all the other squeaker toys, this one is the most fun for all of us.",dogs,3

Then I wanted to try a new product so I bought Musher's and I LOVE IT! I really thought that it would stain my carpet, but it did not. It conditioned his paws as well. He was ok with me putting this on his paws too and did not give me a hard time. When we went for our walk, I felt good knowing that his paws were protected from the snow, salt, etc... Although I did wipe his paws when we came back into the house to make sure to take any salt or debri off. I would HIGHLY reccomend this product!",cats,2

The only problem is that the lid didn't look like it was closed. The lid easily slips off with a gentle push. -A gentle breeze, even-. Despite the lid, the product itself is very nice. Gives a lot of storage space while being in a cute canine motif. Be careful not to put anything heavy on the box because the thin plastic might crack. Overall, it's a very nice product.",dogs,3

Lax'Aire has been a lifesaver for his digestive system, but on our travels we have occasionally landed in a place where the local vets and pet stores do not carry Lax'Aire. Adobe will not accept other brands. I think it is the addition of cod liver oil that appeals to him - it must have a fishy taste - and he LOVES it. Lax'Aire helps him expel the hair in his digestive tract and eliminates the throwing up that otherwise occurs. I am so happy to be able to buy it online at a reasonable price.",cats,2

"Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20. Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction. One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day. I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans. The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each. But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it. Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.",cats,2
We chose the 7F over the model 7 because it had a full comb of teeth. This results in a smoother cut and requires fewer passes to finish a job.

However, once I switched to the gentle leader they became much calmer. It's not perfect.

Spoon a little onto a plate and warm it for about 9 seconds in the microwave and then stir it back into the can.

"I like this product, and it does what all the reviews say it would do. I won't go into the good things because it's already covered in depth. Instead I'll offer a few criticisms:1. I spent about 20 minutes or so brushing each one of my two cats and it seemed like there was no end in sight. Exactly when is enough enough? I could have probably spent hours brushing until my cat was bald if I was determined enough. At least they liked it a lot more than the regular cat brush.2. How often am I supposed to ""de-fur"" them? It seemed like less than a week and my cats were already noticeably shedding again and they're not even long haired or thick coated. This isn't the product's fault, but I guess I was under the impression that the product would solve my problems for a while and that I wouldn't have to go through this ritual again for a while...wrong.3. After I bought this here (the current $18 + shipping price from Amazon is pretty good compared to PetCo), I was at Walmart and saw another product that I can't remember the name of, BUT it looks 95% identical to this one (same handle design and blade quality) and it only costed $14.

I also spray it in the room and when I want my cats to feel more comfortable. I decided to order the several bottles of the spray at a time as its cheaper than in the pet store where I discovered it. Time to reorder again!",cats,2
"I can't get my cats to drink water, so I thought I'd give this a try. They've had it for three weeks, and are still scared of it. I thought if I could just turn off the fountain, they would get used to it. However, I can't seem to get the lever to totally turn it off. After all, it is a fountain!I'm starting to get used to the sound. If you put it on a rubber mat, it won't vibrate so much. Not that it is terribly loud, but it is noticeable.",cats,2

Doggles are a great product. They are well made and easy to put on my dog. Even though she doesn't like them at this point they do look really cute and keep the wind out of her eyes when we drive with the convertible top down. :),dogs,3
"After trying several over the counter & other home remedies, I ordered the Advantix as a last resort. One application and 24 hours later, no fleas could be seen on either of my three dogs!! Made me feel bad that they'd suffered so long while I tried so many other ways to get rid of the fleas. Will definitely be reordering!",dogs,3
"I had hopes for this. I have two cats, one is 2 years old and the other 9 or a little older. The younger cat was getting the idea but the older one was not. and if both cats wouldn't adapt, then it wouldn't work for me. I think I will keep it aside and one day, when I only have one cat, a young one, I will begin again to train it. The younger cat showed me it can be done. I would highly recommend this product for people with 1, young, cat. If I only had the younger cat, I'd be free of cat litter.",cats,2

"After watching my 82 year old mom drive with her little poodle in her lap, I bought this seat for the safety of both of them. I selected this seat because it seemed to be the best car seat for the price. Her 12 pound dog can stretch out in comfort now. It also gives her dog height so that she can look out the window. The dog had some issues with car sickness, but for some magic reason, that problem has gone away after she started riding in the seat. There is an adjustable strap included that can be snapped to her coller so that she has room to move around but cannot jump out of the seat. It is perfect for what it was purchased for.",dogs,3

"I love this stuff. My 9y/o cat broke his leg when he was a kitten and has a fused knee. This causes him stress and pain, esp when it gets cold. I put him on cosaquin a little over a month ago ans he is doing great. He now jumps up into the window seals and chases our other cat all over the place. All I do it sprinkle it on a little bit of soft food (he likes the flaky stuff, not the mushy stuff) and stir it in. I'm going to keep him on this for life now.",cats,2
"I love it, it reduced dog hair shedding by 80%, it's amazing! no matter how much do I use it, the dog hair just keeps coming out (means less on the floors).Only gripe I have it that it's a pain as it takes about 20 mintues to do it, I do it once every few weeks, but no pain no gain.",cats,2
"My Little pup LOVES his new bed; it is soft and well constructed. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had MORE padding on the bottom. I put a small blanket under the bottom cushion, though, and now its very plush. My little guy will actually leave our laps for awhile to lay in this new bed. For the price, it's the best. I'm sure if you paid more then you'd have more cushion in the bottom.",dogs,3
"This is the best toy we have ever had for our lab, it's the only toy he does not tear up. He can normally get more than a year out of one of these which is great. We play fetch and he carries it everywhere with him, we recently went on a long driving trip and lost one but I always have a spare, if we don't he will look and look for it. If you have a lab you know how focused they can be and he is no different, he always knows where his ball is at all times.",dogs,3
"I bought this litter box a few weeks ago and my biggest concern was that my scardy cat who hates change would reject using a covered litter box after 14 years of using an open box. She took to it right away and it has been an awesome upgrade for me as an owner and designated litter box cleaner. My first litter box was one of those $100 Litter Maid self cleaning litter boxes....it broke down right after the warranty ran out. I bought a second one and it broke down before the warranty ran out so they sent me a third one. I was so tired of it I continued using broken box #2 never even opening the 3rd new box, instead I chose to scoop the litter and place it in the Litter Maids storage compartment until full so I would only have to empty it once per week and keep the smell contained within the storage compartment.Now I have the Omega, my hands never touch a scoop or messy storage compartment lid anymore. The box is sealed well so no litter gets out during my cats use or during the rolling process during cleaning. It is so simple and clean I wish I had invented it! Now I still don't want to carry cat waste out to my garbage can twice a day so I have created my own weekly storage container for the Omega like my Litter Maid had built-in. I went to a Dollar Store and bought a $1 plastic pitcher (The kind you put drinks in to pour into drinking glasses). I pull the top off and put in a pair (double layer) of those plastic grocery bags we all get piles of from grocery shopping, the way you would line your garbage can, and I place it near my cat's litter box so each time I roll it and have waste in the tray I pour the waste into my waste container (drink pitcher) and then place its top back on to contain the smell. It works great, no smell, contains enough waste for a week of single cat use so I only have to throw it out once a week, and my hands never come close to touching waste or litter. The litter box itself also cuts down on dust compared to my old open box, it seems to be more efficient in its use of clumping litter compared to using a scoop in an open box, and my cat even seems to track less litter out of the box because she has to walk out through a hole rather than leap out like she did in an open litter box. For those of you who have cats who like to launch litter across the room rather than lightly scratch litter around while in in their box then you'll pretty much appreciate any closed litter box. In my opinion you will love this box and at a sale price of $33.25 for a large box with free shipping it is a no-brainer.",cats,2

"My male Cairn has carried this toy (he has the cow, which has lasted longer than most other noise-making toys he's owned) around since Grandma got it for him over a year ago. His best play buddy (terrier mix) also got one and she loves hers, too. Incredibly annoying, yes, especially when the dog goes to great lengths to bring it to you, no matter what you're doing, because he wants to play! My husband and I actually love the sound because it's so cheerful - kind of makes whatever you're doing seem less important and injects some much needed humor...the pup always seems to know when we need it most!It's held up to tug-of-wars with our other Cairn, throwing, repetitive biting, etc, for over a year. That said, it's died a slow, miserable death, and as the music dies it sounds more like Death Metal than a kids' song, but that is equally hilarious. We're on to our next Deedle Dude and can't decide which one to get!We highly recommend this if you love playing with your dog, have a dog that likes causing mischief with his toys, and if you both appreciate light-hearted humor. If you're easily annoyed and/or don't like interacting with your dog, don't bother.",dogs,3

"This bed isn't bad for the money. You get what you pay for. This bed was nothing but trouble to put together. It took more than an hour for my fiance, my sister, and myself to figure it out. The bars did not fit so we would get 3 sides put in and could not get the 4th in. We had to bend it a weird way to make it fit. The directions were NOT helpful at all either, they had poorly labeled pictures, and nothing else.Other than the serious trouble getting the bed put together, the bed isn't bad. It is very loud in the middle of the night when the dog gets up and down and shifts positions because of the material and the way her nails rubbed on it. We put a sheet on it and it solved the problem! I have a 85 pound Great Pyrenees and it sags quite a bit, so for a bigger dog I would get a larger size. Color was more of a hunter green and not the ugly green pictured, although that could just be my monitor settings.",cats,2

"There are so many tablets!! It's such a great value! I It has all the vitamins that your dog might need. I love that it's made in the USA and I would recommend this product for most owners looking for a health boost.I personally do not like this product (anymore) because my dog is now much healthier and eats very healthy. She doesn't get any corn, wheat, soy, or by-products in her diet. I don't like that this has corn in it. Of course this is such a small amount when analyzing a dog's full diet that it's actually not such a big problem, especially for others. When I had fed this to my dog I had crumbled it into her food. Sometimes I would give it to her directly but she wouldn't take it from me unless I gave it as a reward for doing a command (i.e. &#34;sit&#34;). So you might have to make your pup work for this &#34;treat&#34;.There's not much wrong with this product, but be aware that there are already a lot of vitamins in most dog foods - so it might not even be necessary to buy this. You might be better off buying a raw food boost supplement, or simply upgrading your dog's food. Make sure that the ingredients excludes wheat, soy, corn, AND by-products, otherwise it is NOT really an upgrade in quality.Good luck - and I hope your dog stays healthy! :)",dogs,3

"I didn't know whether to purchase the 4 or 8 panel pen, but am glad I decided on the 8-panel. It is much higher than the 4-panel, and is very versatile. It assembles easily and when we need to open it up to clean up if our puppy has an accident, it's easy. At first I thought, gosh, it's so high, we can't climb over it. However, just slide out one of the posts, and then just slide it closed temporarily while removing any soiled papers. Our puppy has her crate within the pen, so when I need to clean the pen, I just put her inside the crate, and remove the paper, walk out, and reinsert the post. The doggie door is great, it has two latches, both of which have a small screw on them to tighten it so little houdinis can't open it! And once she is trained, it will be a great room divider, and we can use it in two different sections. It's so versatile that way, and can be flexibly set up in an octagon shape or rectangular shape as well, however you would like to configure it. Or use just 4 or 5 of the 8 pieces, depending on your needs. All around a terrific deal, I've seen it for $129, thank you Amazon!",dogs,3

"I was really skeptical about this product but also becoming desperate. I was trying to integrate a (spayed) female rescue kitten in with my male and older female (all neutered and spayed) cats. My older female and the kitten were acting out, ruining all my rugs, peeing on floors, etc. I plugged in the diffusers and, to my surprise, noticed an almost immediate difference. The cats were definitely calmer. It did take a few weeks for all the unacceptable behavior to stop but the worst of it stopped almost immediately. I also purchased a can of the spray to keep the behavior from spreading to my couches and carpeting and to spray directly on the areas they fouled earlier but I stopped using that after a couple of weeks. The diffusers are done and I did not need to order a refill for this purpose. I wish I had known about Feliway when I moved the kitties cross country. Although they did not misbehave, I know it would have calmed them and helped them through the stress of the relocation. I will order refills in the future if needed.",cats,2

"I read all the mixed reviews and decided that I should give the product a shot. I have a cat that is obsessed with having food in his bowl at all times and my schedule can be irregular. If his bowl is empty he will then eat all of the food I put in it, get sick, and a few minutes later the food will reappear somewhere in the house. This is how he scams me into giving him extra food or feeding him early. I figured if I didn't personally feed him he might not get as much food and thus my cat might one day weigh less than the 20+ lbs he weights right now. I must admit that programming the feeder was slightly challenging but the 4 or 5 minutes it took to get it all straight was well worth it to have timed feedings. My cat is a bit skittish, so he does still jump when his food is deployed...3 feedings a day for a month and he's still not 100% sure what it's going to do to him. Overall I am very pleased with this product and I think my cat is eating less now that there is some food in his bowl at all times. Additionally, I have found no ""used"" food around my house since the feeder was setup. Hopefully his roly-poly tummy will soon see some benefit too!",cats,2

My son actually touched the prongs to see if it was shocking and it was working but my cat seemed to like it. He would lay next to it whenever he had the collar on. Then I put it on my other cat to see what kind of reaction he would give. He had no reaction to this device either. Maybe I have strange cats, but this really had no effect on my cats.",dogs,3

The problem is that the cartridges are expensive, and I felt that quite a bit of the liner was wasted when you had to pull it away from the roll, and cut it on the cutting blade inside the container. Then you have to pull more out and knot it, and hook it inside. When you tied off the filled bag, almost double the length was wasted. If you empty the container when it is full, it adds up. Would be best for someone in an apartment or who had difficulty getting outside regularly.",cats,2

Whenever I come home from work, one of my cats will carry the cat dancer to me in her mouth, then sit there and meow until I pick it up and play with her. I know, the idea sounds pretty simple - some pieces of cardboard on a piece of wire - but believe me, it is a very effective toy. It's also very easy to use, you basically just have to sit there and wiggle it around a little, and the cats will go nuts.

"I have two boxers - a 60lb highly food motivated male who literally drools when I reach for these ""cookies"" and a 45lb finicky princess who thoroughly inspects anything offered to her before eating it (or not). These Blue Dog Bakery Treats are hands down, the best dog biscuits I have found... And both of my dogs LOVE them.Even though both dogs are on grain free diets, I make Blue Dog treats the one exception because of the clean, all natural ingredients. Each box contains a variety of flavors and a few sizes -- I have been searching for larger sized dog treats, and these are perfect. As a bonus (for me) these treats don't smell like dog food - they actually smell pretty good.I put these on auto delivery so I always have them on hand... And I break them into smaller pieces for use when training (my male is a recent rescue).I will point out that there was a quality control problem with the last batch I ordered. Instead of their usual rich colors and crisply defined shapes, three of the boxes I've recently opened contained paste-y blobs formed into biscuits. They smelled the same and my dogs didn't seem to notice a difference, so I kept them. So, they still earn 5 stars in my book - but that will change if this problem persists. If quality control is lacking - that could be an indicator of more significant issues. For now I still highly recommend.",dogs,3

"Rescued a dog from the shelter and upon arrival at home had horrible diarrhea. Took him to vet next day and found out he had Giardia. Was sent home with Metrodanzole. After a few days into Metrodanzole stools were a slight improvement, as soon as antibiotic finished, diarrhea looked worse than ever. (With the Metrodanzole he also got probiotics to balance his GI system). I was very discouraged with the worsening diarrhea, and vet did not want him rechecked for 30 days from his last dose of antibiotic. Well since i have two other dogs and Giardia was highly contagious i had to keep him seperated in my shed. Well 30 days is way too long to sit and do nothing. It's summer here in Texas, and i needed some other options quick and get this dog well and back in the house. So checked some blogs and read how Panacur has shown better results in clearing a Giardia infection. Well it was Sunday (vet was closed), when i read this and i had to be at work during the week and could not take off, on a whim i decided to check and see if it could be purchased on amazon. To my relief and amazement, you could! i ordered it and rec'd it in a matter of two days. . i started his treatment immediately, i bought two packs and treated him for 6 days. I read recommended dosage for giardia was 5-7 days and the pack only came in 3 day supply. I think the 3 day supply is successful for worms. Only a few days into Panacur and to my amazement his stools started improving. They are now completely normal, and his energy levels have spiked! Nearly two weeks later had him rechecked, and what do you know, no giardia! Thank you Panacur! And thank you Amazon for selling it on here!!",dogs,3
"I have been using this product for a couple years and love it. Its best feature is its detangling power. My rescue collie/border collie used to HATE being brushed, especially her tail. But without frequent brushing she will tangle or matt. Now I spray on unicoat first, and it makes brushing *much* more comfortable for her (and easier for me!) Added with positive training, she no longer snaps at the brush and even gets excited when she sees it. Unicoat is also great for reducing static. We have forced air, and my poor dogs get shocked constantly throughout the winter. But we spray some unicoat on a brush and run it through their coat, and the shocking drastically reduces. This also helps with shedding and flyaway hair. Last, Unicoat is great for between bath touch ups- though reviews and claims that it replaces a bath surprise me. It freshens the fur, gives a nice (but fairly strong) baby powder scent, and helps to clean. It's great for when my Sheltie comes in covered in mud. It helps get the mud off of him *much* better than a wet towel alone will, and in turn keeps the floors and furniture safe. But it's also not going to return his fur to a vibrant white like a bath would- nor should I expect it to. Overall, it is a great product to use BETWEEN baths for touch ups and situational fixes. Used in combination with frequent brushing, it keeps their coat shiny, healthy, less shedding, and smelling nice. It's on my list of the greatest products every pet owner should have, up there with Kongs, no-spill bowls, and martingale collars.",cats,2

"At first the vented screen became unseated, preventing the flow of clean litter and resulting in its being tossed into the drawer. Then the clips on the edges were sliding back, causing litter to leak on the floor when the unit was rolled over. In a few days those problems disappeared somehow.

"I am elated that I chose to disregard comments claiming sharp edges and poor quality workmanship. For the price, I was willing to stay flexible in my impressions, especially since my dog had already been trained to have some crate etiquette. Definitely a pleasant surprise to have received a product that does its job safely and efficiently.Pros:* It shipped flawlessly. Both the outer and original packaging were free of dings and tears.* Easy assembly. I didn't read a word of the instructions.* NO sharp corners. It has been perfectly safe for my pup so far.* Locking mechanism started off a little stiff but it loosened up and makes for easy open/close, especially for those of us who are crate training.* THE DIVIDER. I've already adjusted the crate's size since purchase and I can't express just how useful it is for crate training.* I don't need it since my puppy isn't one to soil her bed, but the removable pan is a nice touch for those who do. Stays securely in place.* Travel-friendly. Collapses in nothing flat, with simple but sturdy clips to hold everything in place.I haven't seen the advantage to it but the second door is nice. Half pro?Cons:These are limited considering the price point. Most are improvements rather than criticisms.* I have three cats. Beware, the spacing in the wiring is quite large and has led to some teasing/toy stealing. I also have a Sheltie and she is able to put her snout all the way out. For a more aggressive puppy, I'd be wary of things you leave in and around the crate. I found my sweetums chewing on a box flap. Easily fixed, nonetheless.* I wouldn't say the locking mechanism is great for the most mischievous furry locksmiths out there but, once again, my pup is quite content being in her crate so she hasn't tried it. Gets a little too loose with use. I could see it being opened from the inside with no sweat.* It includes a detachable handle but it sucks royally. I just carry the thing with my finger through the spaces. They're big spaces any way.* The joints that hold the sides together look flimsy. Maybe it's just my preference but I feel like it might impact VERY long term use, especially if you take it on the go. Could fall apart.* The paint chips easily. I'm not one for aesthetics so I could care less, but I figure it's worth mentioning for someone with a mouthy animal.I like detailed reviews, so there you have it. What I will say with my final word is that this product is DIRT CHEAP and does it's job without a hitch, hence my 5 stars. This review is based on three weeks of use, give or take. If you're looking for a fancy premium or heavy duty product to take with you from place to place, I'm not too keen on this being the item for you. Its workmanship is not reliable in the long run unless you collapse it any time it is moved. The look is very basic and shouldn't improve over time considering the paint issues. If you're like me and looking to crate train/provide a little den for your loved one, look no further. It's got the divider, the casual portability factor for when you go on vacations, and it's safe for one real small price tag.",dogs,3
I purchased this for a cat. We needed to keep her closed in at nights. It is nice and roomy for her. It took her about 5 days to get used to it. The crate went together fairly easy. It is sturdy.

"I heard about this tool through a friend when I was talking about all the hair my new pupppy leaves on my hard surface floors (I don't have any carpet). Immediately, I ordered this product and use it on my puppy every other day or every 3 days to keep the floors free of it. My 8-month old puppy loves it and melts when I start using it on her. She even wants me to use it on her tummy. The only thing she doesn't like is when I say ""we're done""! This dog is a chow mix but her daddy must have had lab in him as she sheds like a lab.I also use it on my short-hair cat and she loves it, too. I get more hair out of her with this then I do with her cat brush. Again, it doesn't work so well on the long-haired cat.My other dog is also a chow mix but the FURminator does not work on her because she has different type of hair.I recommend this to anyone who wants to eliminate dust bunnies on the floor left behind by pets.",cats,2

"This is a bit bulky compared to my old ultralight collar I bought 8 years ago, which by the way still works and uses a regular 2032 calculator battery. It's too bad they changed the battery on the new ones. I compared the ultralight collar to the small dog collar and didn't see a whole lot of size difference. The price of the ultralight is considerably less, however. Works well on my pomeranian. Seems to give more of a buzz than a shock. Does not have correction levels like the old collar does.

"I luckily got this product from a pet supply distributor I deal with to try for free. I am in the pet care industry and have tried pretty much every type of litter out there. I usually use my personal cats as test-dummies for new products and had high but reasonable hopes for World's Best Scoopable Multi-Cat Litter... So I do a full litter box clean out, scrub the box and add several inches of litter to the box; the smell was 'off' to begin with but I figured I'd give it a try. Five hours later my husband comes home, uses the bathroom and tells me he thinks I need to clean the cat box... he's in disbelief when I tell him I just put brand new litter in the box. The litter lasted less than a week in my house, one of my three cats started urinating and defecating on the bathroom floor the first night the litter was in use and I finally couldn't stand dealing with it anymore, cleaning up accidents & the smell throughout my house, of this nasty litter.I scoop the litter box daily, I absolutely loved the clumping of this litter, it was pretty much dust-free, and the product seemed to last & last unlike regular clay litters that must be replenished often... Why oh Why must it smell so horrible? My cats will use ANY box with ANY litter as long as it is clean, BUT WBCL is an absolute waste when your cat won't even use it!",cats,2
Pen is too high. It is very easy to take apart. It gives my dog the freedom to walk around outside. It takes up a lot of space indoors. My dog was peeing on the base of the pen.

"These treats are around $6-8 a box where I live, so the price on Amazon is great! I bought a case of six mid-November, and my dog is finally on his last box. He normally goes through a $10 bag of Beggin' Strips in a week, so we're saving a LOT on doggie treats.As for the flavor, my dog will eat just about any treat, but he seems to be more excited about these than most hard treats (he usually prefers soft ones). I like that they smell good, unlike some similarly priced treats, which seems to reduce stinky doggie breath (and I'll admit it, I tasted one... wasn't too impressed with the flavor, but they're not for me!).The only downside is that some of the treats are HUGE, but they can be broken up into smaller pieces.",dogs,3

"We just adopted a dog and needed a gate to provide a dog-free part of the house for our cats. Deciding which add-ons we needed and putting this together went very quickly and needed no tools. Installing the bumpers on the walls took only a screwdriver.We found that even at 25 lbs. our cocker spaniel could go through the kitty door, so we removed the vertical bar nearest the hinge, using a hack saw. The kitty door stays closed and doesn't swing around (a plus in itself), and the cats can slip through the smaller opening easily.",dogs,3

"I bought this after my vet told us that our 9 week old kitten had roundworms. He tried to sell us a prescription wormer for $26 with only 2 doses but I knew there were better cheaper alternatives out there. I first tried an over the counter medication with piperazine but that was a disaster. It obviously tasted horrible and our kitten would not eat anything with the medicine. Next I tried wiping it on his legs so he would lick it off but that was equally disasterous. He kept flicking his paws trying to get rid of the medication and refused to lick anywhere near the foul tasting areas. He must've gotten some in him though because he vomited a few hours later. I did some more research on the web and found Nemex 2 was supposed to be safe and effective in dogs and puppies and was often used off label for kittens, cats and many other animals. I decided to give it a shot. I waited a few days to be sure the previous medication was out of my kitty's system and then mixed this with a little milk. He drank down every drop of the medicine and the next day I found evidence it had worked. Excellent product and it didn't seem to make him ill like the piperazine.",dogs,3

My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love!

"A short summary of our problem cat's life....We have the sweetest, friendliest cat ever. He's part of a multi-cat household. His problems, and ours, began when he was 4 yrs. old. He began showing dominance by chasing our 14 yr old cat until she'd hide from him & he also started marking his territory in our home!! If you're wondering, yes, he was neutered. He's lucky, very lucky, that we are so kind-hearted. Instead of doing away with him, he's been banished to our closed-in porch.Through the years, I tried a couple different enzyme products, but got frustrated with them because I'd have to mix just the right amount of enzyme with just the right amount of warm water, pour on the urine spot, cover with a damp cloth and make sure the urine spot remained wet for a required amount of time. I grew tired of that, and started using white vinegar, but it didn't get all the smell out. Now, 13 years later, I read an article about Anti-Icky-Poo, and decided to go for it. The deciding factor was that it doesn't need to be kept wet. Off and on, in about 6 weeks time, I managed to use a quart of it on some urine spots on our closed in porch. Imagine my surprise when that nasty smell was finally gone from the porch!!! This stuff works! I recently ordered the gallon size & haven't had to use much because I'm also usingFarnam Comfort Zone Feliway Electric Diffuser with 48-Milliliters Imitation Cat Pheromone. My vet sold me some Feliway (75mL) Spray several years ago. I used it a few times but stopped because I wasn't comfortable spraying my furniture and walls with it, & you need to spray often. So, that's when Raskal was banished to our closed-in porch.Using Anti-Icky-Poo and Comfort Zone Feliway Diffuser has almost eliminated our problem...our home is intact and finally our porch doesn't stink. Poor, sweet Raskal is still banished to our porch, which we've made very comfy for him through the years. He even has his own cat house with an incandescent bulb we use to heat it in cold weather. We just can't bring ourselves to trust him in our home any more. Maybe someday I'll be brave, plug in a Feliway diffuser, and give him another chance; after all, I can use Anti-Icky-Poo to clean up his mess. *but I really don't want to be cleaning up that kind of mess in our home**After purchasing Anti-Icky-Poo, I found out that if you have a stubborn or old urine spot, that Anti-Icky-Poo will also work if it's kept wet. So just cover it with plastic, wax paper or tinfoil for a while. You'll use less A-I-P & have quicker results. A.I.P. can also be diluted with up to 3 parts water.Taken from the label",cats,2

"I originally bought the Kyjen eggs all by themselves to see if my dogs would rip them apart or not, and I was amazed that they loved the eggs but didn't rip them up. I think it has something to do with the size of them, they sit perfectly in the mouth and they're a bit hard to get a hold of with their paws to rip them up. When the platypus toy with the eggs went on sale, I jumped at the chance to get the dogs another exciting toy.Two out of three of my dogs actually like toys, my oldest doesn't have any interest at all. The other two just adore the platypus! They take it with them everywhere, from room to room, out the doggie door, all around the town. They sleep with it, eat with it and rest their heads on it. It's a definite keeper. So far they have not removed the eggs from the toy and I'll let that happen in it's own time. The directions tell us humans to pull the eggs out and put them back in while our dogs watch the process and then let them figure it out by themselves, but I think my dogs will be shocked and thrilled to figure it out on their own. The toy comes with two extra egg toys on the side for use at another time or to play with by themselves. (three eggs in the toy) Besides being a wonderful amusement for dogs, this set of furry objects is priced right and made extremely well. I am so happy I purchased this and will go back for other Kyjen products in the future. The eggs alone make fabulous stocking stuffers for friends' dogs as well. Thanks for such an intuitive, creative, entertaining gadget for my canine babes !!",dogs,3

This collar was great a first! It worked for about 6months then we had to buy a new one cause it stopped working. The 2nd one worked for a bit but our dog started to figure out that if she barked 10 or more times the collar would run and then she was a free women to bark all she wants. So we had to keep refilling it. I bought numerous refills and replacement batteries for the collar. It finally got to the point where the collar was just blowing air not even the spray was working. So we finally bit the bullet and went with the shock collar.,dogs,3

"I waited about 9 months before writing this to make sure the Omega litter box still worked as well as it did the first day. It does! I still chuckle a bit every time I empty it because of:A) How quick and easy it is. We're talking about 15 seconds from the time you walk up to it to putting the waste in a bag.B) Because I wish I had gotten one years ago. The only ones I had seen were the motorized type with the rake that comes across. I never got one because I figured the rake would get quite foul, the mechanism would crap out after not too long and thought they were over priced at $90 for some of them.Whoever thought of this design is a smart feller, very simple and super effective. When you roll the unit over, the litter falls into a separate compartment with a grate over it; the waste falls over the grate into the bin. Roll it back over past level to redistribute the litter into the main tray and ka-boom, you're done, just pull out the waste tray and dump it! Every 5-7 dump outs, just add a few pounds of litter through the opening to top it up.Upkeep wise, it doesn't get nasty inside. After about 5 months, I took the two halves apart to change out the litter because there are a few little bits that will fall through the grate that never make it to the waste tray. The inside was still clean and didn't even require a full washout; filled it up with fresh litter and ready to go.The unit feels slightly flimsy at first, especially the latches that keep it together, but as long as you are carefull latching it up, they will be fine. I think the build quality is adequate and it will last a long time. If they built it doubly thick, it may have costed twice as much. Considering the convenience, I think it is a bargain.",cats,2
"My dog had BUN levels in the higher end of the normal range from the time I adopted her. I have her blood tested twice a year because of the many health issues my last dog had -- I always wish I had known about her problems sooner so I could have taken some preventative measures rather than wait until the problem was major.When my current dog's BUN levels finally went above the normal range, I searched for something that could help before permanent kidney problems occurred (my last dog had kidney failure among other things, and I could not go through that again, especially with a dog so young). I give her these Renal Essentials daily, and her BUN level is lower than it was when I first adopted her. I will continue to give this to her daily unless the vet says or the blood work shows that it could cause problems.",dogs,3
"Being able to clean out all waste(solid AND liquid) on a day to day basis is the main reason I switched over to Swheat Scoop which I really like. It keeps the cat box truly clean and it's flushable.I was previously using Feline Pine(also reviewed) for a single adult cat but switched to Swheat scoop after having waste coverage issues with the pine pellets with my new kitten. Essentially, if your cat/kitten has runny turds, you need a finer litter size to effectively cover that waste so your cats don't step on them and track cat poo all over the house.Feline Pine is ""set it and forget it""(basically, it absorbs all liquids for two weeks and then you toss out the entire box of litter) but it's NOT flushable(the Swheat Scoop is), so you have to deal with wasting trashbags on a bag full of used litter. For me, that was fine every two weeks for one cat, but not every week with two cats.The Swheat Scoop works great in terms of clump-ability and odor control. You do have to ""pan for gold"" every day or so and having the right scoop is crucial(I recommend the Scoopwell Cat Litter Scoop) for that. Also, you absolutely need a tracking mat. My Omega Paw Paw-Cleaning Litter Mat which worked fine for the larger Feline Pine pellets, simply did not cut it here. I found a product called StopTrax that is essentially a grid on top of a catch basin. It does a great job of catching the smaller grain of the SwheatScoop.I have had no issues that others mention. Yes, you do have to scrape the bottom of the box from time to time, but it's a fairly simple matter if you clean it every couple of days. Odor control is great and the litter has a faint sweet wheat smell. It doesn't cover the odor up, it just ""takes care of it"". I even removed the cover of my Booda Box to allow my cats more space to ""work"" in and I have not smelled any odor.Other than the tracking issues(and it is an issue, you WILL need a good tracking mat/rug), this stuff is near perfect and it's much cheaper than World's Best.",cats,2
"There are reviews about this being loud. Give it a little time before making a decision to return it. First off, I previously had an Aqueon filter on 29 gallon tank. This Emperor 280 is almost twice as big as that Aqueon. It pumps a lot more water also. So, naturally it is a little louder but not much. For the first couple of days it was noticeably louder but now (2 weeks later) you can barely hear it. I do believe it was just too clean at first and needs a little break-in time. The Aueon was quieter but it also is smaller and it was also for the same size tank. You can use this Emperor for up to 50 gallons. So if you plan on upgrading later on, you may as well get it now and it will be established already for when you do upgrade down the road. Personally, I am going to use two of these for a 55 gallon tank whenever I happen to upgrade.It has a huge amount of space for bacteria to grow. I filled the empty media cartridge up with AquaClear BioMax Filter Media. This along with the bio wheel will allow a lot more bacteria growth compared to many other filters.It creates a lot of top water disturbance as the water flows back into the tank, which is very good.If I have any problems or further info I will update this review.UPDATE:I ordered this on November 4th, 2012. So I installed it a few days later. It is now November 25th. I don't hear this thing running at all unless you put your head right up to it. At first it did have a little noise like a mechanical sound, but I believe it just needed to break-in. It is actually very quiet. Unless your water level is low in the tank, you won't really hear anything.",fish aquatic pets,4

"If your dog ever get's skunked you want to have Skunk Off handy. The quicker you treat after the skunk sprays your dog, or you, the more effective the product. I had a young bird dog sprayed by a huge skunk in South Dakota. My buddy said ""Oh my gosh, we've got to smell that the rest of the week?"" When I got the dog back to the truck I put him on the tailgate, sprayed a heavy application of Skunk Off on the dog and thoroughly rubbed it in. By the time we got back to our hotel the buddy said, "" I don't believe it, you can barely smell it. I put a second application on and by the next morning the odor was very faint. I've used it several times and the stuff works. Remember the sooner after the skunking episode the more effective, use plenty.

"I was so excited to find the one toy that our dog dearly loves. I found it by going to hartz, searched through the pictures, and clicked on the picture that was an identical match to what he had for many years. He has a boxful of toys, but when we say ""go get your toy"", he only goes to this one particular toy. A few days later, I read the confirmation of the order and that a toy selected from an assortment was being shipped. That is not what I wanted. I even called them on the phone and told them that I was willing to buy a second toy if that toy was the exact copy of what I thought I was ordering. The semi-rude lady from customer service seemed to care less if the customer was happy with his order or not, and that they would not hand select the toy that I wanted to order. On Christmas, I helped the dog to unwrap his toy, squeaked it a couple of times, and tossed it in the air for the dog. The dog was sitting on the couch and just watched it bounce on the floor and never made an effort to jump down to play with it. To this day he has not shown any interest in it. The dog is smart enough to know an inferior product when he sees one. The only way anyone can make me happy (and the dog) is to send the exact toy that I ordered.",dogs,3

"I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. It also doesn't have any breath freshening ingredients. I think the only reason why they are ""dental"" treats is because they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. These are MUCH better than the pounce soft and chewy varieties or any soft and chewy treat that can stick to cat teeth and cause bad breath and tooth decay. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. This treat may not help cat teeth, but they definitely won't hurt them. Also there are vitamins in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as ""dental,"" they really should have at least one dental ingredient. If your looking for a true dental treat, I recommend Crunch n' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have many beneficial dental ingredients either, but they are another pretty good one as they too contain vitamins but with a little bit of added breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are slightly better than these.",cats,2

"I have two elderly dogs (both over the age of 13) that have joint and hip issues. In an effort to alleviate the stiffness, I turned to glucosamine. I tried several brands of tablets and none have met my dogs' approval. When I feed my dogs, these tabs sit at the bottom of their dish. If I have any hope of them being consumed, I have to use a pill cutter or knife to break them in halves and quarters and then I have to cover them with canned dog food. What's more, my dogs need more than 500 mg of glucosamine so doing this several times a day was a tad much. I've since started to useFor Animals-K-9 Level 5000 Glucosamine - 32 oz - Liquid. I place the liquid on top of their food and they don't appear to notice, or at least, have not engaged in any hunger strikes because of its presence.According to the Nutri Vet Hip and Joint Plus container, 1/2 chew is recommended per 40 lbs. of body weight. If you decide to follow the guidelines, prepare to get out the pill cutters. These tablets are a decent size but not easily snapped in half without the use of a supplemental cutting aide. Each tab has 500 mg of glucosamine, which is from a shellfish source. Two-hundred mg of chondroitin sulfate is also provided, which hails from a bovine source.This product has received good reviews and, to be fair, my dogs are older and have poor teeth. This might have played a role in their distaste for the product, which is a little denser than other glucosamine tabs on the market.According to the product labeling, this product may be used with pregnant dogs. This product should not be given to dogs with an allergy to shellfish.This product is made in the United States.",dogs,3

After reading all the glowing reviews for the Safari De-Matting Comb I decided to try it. Not Impressed. Overall I found it to do what it's supposed to. It works well with a gentle sawing motion and as long as you are patient. It took me 15 minutes to remove one matted clump from my Spaniel's underbelly. Personally I think I can get more done with a metal comb as the teeth are closer together and I don't have to make repeated passes in the same spot to catch the knots. I really can't complain too much being that the price was so great but I found the blades to be impossible to reverse. There really is no way to safely remove the blades without the risk of damaging the blades or my hands!! If anyone has had success in reversing the blades please let me know your technique!,dogs,3
"I like this product since it is easy to use and set up and seems to have good results. I loved the sound of my cat scrambling to the floor the first time she jumped up on the counter in front of this device! BUT, there is one design flaw in my opinion that can easily be solved:The only on/off is a switch on the back, so it is natural for humans (!) to forget if it is armed or not. A small LED popping out of the top and pulsing on for 100msec every 3-4 sec or so would be great so that you could visually tell if it is armed (on). This method also would not use much power. Too many false alarms by me reduce its effect;) And the on/off switch could be improved since it is small and a bit stiff, and probably the first thing to wear out. Otherwise I like the idea and implementation!",cats,2
I have had this product for a about a month and so far so good. The audible mode is a bit annoying if you are around. But if you want something to stop your dog from barking when you're out it works really well. FYI- my dog is very sensitive to high pitched sounds so its effects on other dogs I am unsure of. If your dog hides from a smoke detector it probably would work well as mine does. I would not recommend leaving it on when you are home because any sufficiently loud sound will set it off. It also works for loud yelping. I recommend not using the inaudible mode because you will never actually know when its going off unless you are watching your dog.,dogs,3

"I have had this product for over 5 years, and it has been my cats' favorite toy and scratcher from day 1. I have been amazed at how durable this scratcher is, especially considering that my cats attack it with such zeal on a daily basis. Finally after all these years, my kitten managed to get to the catnip inside. Although the toy is now disemboweled, I still can't bear to throw it away - if possible, my cats love it even more. No matter what other toys I introduce to them, my cats always come back to this mouse. I will, however, be buying a second one that looks a little less rough! :) For such a great scratcher that lasts and stays a favorite for so many years, this is a great product.",cats,2
"I have a one year old english mastiff who is over 100 lbs and crazy strong. I had previously purchased the Easy Walk front hook harness but was having issues with it not staying up in the front (so she'd trip over it or wiggle out of it), and with it rubbing her legs raw (armpit area). Not sure if that is an issue with the harness or if I just never got it adjusted correctly but I just couldn't seem to get it to work. I decided to give the gentle leader a try and it's working GREAT! I'm pretty petite but I have total control of her with this harness. It takes some getting used to on her part....she seemed a little annoyed by it at first and would paw at it trying to get it off...but we keep practicing with it and that is getting less and less. The only down side is that people unfamiliar with the gentle leader think it's a muzzle...which makes them assume your dog is dangerous. That couldn't be farther from the truth with Tora, actually the reason she pulls is because she wants to run up and meet everyone we see. But it looks that way so it can cause people to avoid you.",dogs,3

"I buy lots of things through Amazon and for the most part, I'm usually satisfied. However, this has got to be the worst piece of garbage they've sold me to date. I purchased one of these last year from a local pond supply store here on Long Island, N.Y., and it got me through the Winter of 2011. Sounds good but considering it hardly snowed or got very cold last Winter, it's also not saying much. When I placed it into my pond this past December, I noticed it was not working and in fact, the plastic housing began to melt before my eyes. At this point, I removed it from my pond and ordered a new one through Amazon...same manufacturer and model number. I received it the first week in January 2013 and installed it immediately. It apeared to work O.K. for the first few weeks but that's not saying much since there was only a very thin layer (1/4&#34;) of ice on the pond each morning during that time. On February 8, we were hit with a pretty intense snow storm that left about two feet of snow on the ground. The next day, I went out to the pond and brushed the snow away to find the De-icer inoperative and frozen in a 2-3 inch layer of ice. I checked the ground fault outlet and it was working but the heater was not. Now that most of the ice has melted a few days later, I removed the De-icer and noticed the unit has a crack in the plastic housing. Unfortunately for me, I'm about a week beyond the Amazon return policy date so I'll have to write this one off as a total loss and purchase something else quickly before my Koi start dropping like flies. .

"Before getting a HALTI, we described walking our dog as ""going for a drag"". We had to fight the whole time, tugging back the dog. Even with a choke style collar, the dog would pull while coughing and wheezing. When he wanted to stop to sniff a spot on the ground, he'd brace his body for the tug, and keep on sniffing. Not fun, and not the kind of exercise I had hoped for when walking the dog. Instead of a nice brisk walk, I had shoulder pain...About 5 years too late, we bought a Halti for our English Springer. At first, he bucked and tried to paw it off. That didn't take too long though. You'll quicky find that when the dog sees it, they'll lift their nose for you to put it on without any problem. It is wonderful! I've recommended it to others with both large and smaller breeds, and they've all had the same wonderful results. Make sure that the HALTI fits correctly. If you get one that is too big, and your dog lunges back suddenly, it will come off.Also, if you do stop to talk to a neighbor for too long, the dog may start to paw at the Halti or chew on it in an effort to get it off. Don't let the dog chew on it, it is fabric, and our dog did chew through one.",dogs,3

My 2 year old Boxer noses his Tricky Treat Ball all over the house. He isn't the brightest bulb but immediately understood how to work the ball to make treats come out after being shown how the first time. Now it's like watching dog soccer as he works to get his dinner. This is especially great for days when he is being a pain in the butt and I need to keep him busy for a while to give myself a moment of peace and quiet or when it is too cold or rainy for him to get enough outdoor play. He is also a food gulper so this forces him to only eat a few bits of kibble at a time. We have owned this toy a few months now and it is still in great condition. The last piece or two are too hard to get out even I can't get them out and washing fills it with water that won't come out.,dogs,3

"We were a little nervous about the concerns we saw posted before we bought this product, but went ahead and gave it a try. We couldn't be happier. Our cats have become more enthusiastic drinkers, especially our female cat - who was not fond of drinking water. She used to have problems ""straining"" in her litter box, but the extra water she drinks has solved the problem. We have also been able to cut back on the higher calorie wet-food she was eating (to try to get more moisture in her diet) now that she drinks more.We thought the filters and the cleaning kit might be a rip-off. I don't know how much the filters actually ""purify"" the water, but they certainly help prevent hair and food clogs, and allowed us to go longer between cleanings. Likewise, we found cleaning to be quite easy with the kit. The brushes are just the right size and it only took 5-10 minutes. I can certainly handle that every week or two.The noise hasn't been a problem either. We have hardwood floors, so we put the unit on a towel. If we remove the towel, it makes a slight hum as the motor vibrates against the floor. With the towel, all we hear is the sound of the water running. (You have to expect that, right). We got the extra reservoir, so we can go a couple of days without refilling.With minimal effort on our part, out cats now have something that makes them happier and healthier.",cats,2

"I have to agree with a previous review by M.Brooks. I took her after her video review and went to the local target and bought a 20 gal plastic bin. I traced a circle in the lid and used a utility knife to carve it out. The nice thing about the bin I bought is that there are latches on the side of the bin that snap onto the lid, so you don't have to worry about the lid falling off. My 7 month old cat took to it immediately and christened it with her poo before I could even get the lid on, lol. All in all, I paid 7 dollars for the bin and 2 dollars for the utility blade. That's a total of 9 dollars! Pretty darn cheap. Another plus is that in this way you can at least test this style box on your cats and get the Clevercat box once you know your cats will use it. Better than getting stuck with a 30 dollar storage bin :)",cats,2

"It takes a liitle while for the cats to figure out this is a drinking fountain instead of a toy or useless object, but once they figure it out they prefer it over the other water dishes. (As long as I keep it clean!)In time it gets some hard water stains in the bowl but I just soak it in a vinegar solution (a couple T. of vinegar and fill with water)for 20 minutes or so and that gets rid of the crust and disinfects it too. The pump on my last foundtain died and it was cheaper to get a whole new fountain than replace the pump. When I didn't have the fountain, one of my kitties got sick becasue she wasn't drinking enough water. So it helps keep your pets healthy and that is worth the investment.",cats,2

I tried Critter Ridder but it is most effective on smaller animals and works for less than 30 days.When I was shopping at Fred Meyer, I found Cat Stop. At first I was skeptical.

"The idea of using recycled newspaper for cat litter is awesome. A great re-use for a used product in ample supply.Unfortunately, as cat litter it falls way short, in my opinion.I've had cats most of my life, usually 2 in the house at the same time since 1988. I've tried both clumping and non-clumping litter for over a decade each. I saw this ""Yesterday's News"" product for the first time about 6 months ago, thought it was a great concept and thought I'd give it a try.The litter is very absorbent, as it claims to be, and also not dusty like clumping litters. But aside from that, it has downsides:--Difficult to find and remove soiled litter. It absorbs but doesn't clump. So getting rid of the urine-soaked pieces versus the non-soiled pieces is a challenge. Ideally you'd like to completely remove the bottom 1/4 inch of litter pieces in the box, but of course that's very difficult. Finding feces pieces is also a bit tough since the litter is similarly-colored.--Very stinky to change. While I did my best to remove used pieces as the box was being used, a lot of them remained and when it came to time change the entire box it was just about the smelliest and most urine-y litter box cleanup job I've ever had to deal with.--Congealed bottom pieces also a challenge. Since it's difficult to remove the used pieces, they would tend to congeal at the bottom of the pan. And for me, trying to scoop that congealed layer would cause the scoop to slip sending litter flying out of the box and all over the floor. Now, I admit there might be better ways to change the whole box, but this was a real bummer for me.So maybe I didn't follow the directions closely enough or maybe I don't *get* it, but no cat litter should be this difficult and unpleasant to use. Therefore I don't recommend this cat litter. It might be good for specific implementations like for folks who truly have bad health problems with other litters' dust or if you have sick cats, but for routine use it doesn't cut the mustard. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because using recycled newspaper is a good concept and it does indeed absorb well. I'll be going back to clumping litters which are easiest and best to use IMHO.",cats,2

"These chews are quite rigid and they have some sharp points on them. We have had some bloody stool with these so I will not be buying again.

They seem to be softer, more fleshy. This is also true of things like bully sticks and yak milk chews, whether they are not as sharp or they digest easier, I'm not sure but we've had no problems. I may look for another brand and see if we have a better experience with those, as the beef tendons are definitely more cost effective than the bison tendons.",dogs,3

"We just found out that my oldest cat has FIC. Main factors for managing this disease include reducing stress, increasing water intake and reducing weight. I have 3 cats...the oldest is 5, then 4, then 2. Before the 2 year old came along the 2 oldest were pretty good with each other. They would cuddle on the bed and play. All 3 are rescued and when we brought the 2 year old home she was only about 6 or 7 months. My oldest doesn't like her very much, is jealous, aggressive and they growl like they are man eating beasts (!!) at each other. They would also get in spats and then the middle ""child"" beats up on the oldest because she thinks the oldest is picking on the youngest. They are definitely like children.When my cat first got sick the vet asked about stress and I told her the above. She recommended Feliway, which I had never heard of, and I immediately ordered it. I then had to take her to a specialist for her diagnosis, he recommend the Feliway also! I read many reviews on this product before purchasing. Everyone says to give it at least 2 weeks to begin working and wait a month before you make your decision about it. I have had it plugged in for approximately 1 month...what a huge difference it has made! Now the oldest and youngest don't mess with each other. They will even sit near each other and eat close to each other. Strangest thing! Everyone seems to be very happy now and there is no aggression...just a little (tiny) bit of playfulness.

"My dog, Gus, loves soft squeaky toys, especially ones with long body parts. He flings them around so sometimes they wrap around his neck and others, they go flying. The warthog with its long tail was quickly his favorite (getting it to grunt was a good game).Yesterday, the dog we are dogsitting ""gutted"" it--I'm ordering 2 new ones today. And, no, I won't give Gus the new one until Sadie goes home. :)If your dog likes soft toys (and not just to ""gut"") get a Marmot!",dogs,3

"I did not measure the size of the mussle, but took it from the chart based on a breed (irish setter). We decided to get a muzzle to keep him from eating poop of other animals when he is off leash in the park. The muzzle fits perfectly, we are very happy about that. It took him about two weeks to adjust; I was putting some peanut butter in the muzzle, keeping the muzzle on for several seconds at the beginning and up to a minute or two by the second week. Every time he had a muzzle on, we would play and have fun; after the muzzle is off do not pay attention to the dog, he should feel bored for a while. By the end of second week he was able to wear the muzzle for 10-15 min, and during the third week he was happily running in it for two hours. Sometimes he wants to remove the muzzle and struggles with it for thirty seconds, but it stays on, never became loose. Our dog is very hyper by breed, he was not able to adjust to ""gentle leader"" head leash (just hates it), but OK with this muzzle. He also swims in it if near the water and able to drink while swimming. He is still trying to eat poop, muzzle becomes dirty,(easy to clean) but at least this stuff is not in his mouth.",dogs,3

"This heater works great in my 55-gallon marine tank. It didn't take long to heat my tank and it is pretty accurate. I will only buy titanium heaters after almost being electrocuted by a cracked glass heater (for some reason the GFI didn't trip).It would be nice if the power cord for this heater was a foot longer and also the directions state that the heater is only to be mounted horizontally, I would prefer the option of mounting it vertically also but this is not a big deal.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I have two cats. I purchased this because one of my cats fell in love with a mouse video on Animal Planet's Funniest Videos. Ever since then I have been trying to find a dvd with mice on it. I read the reviews for this one and it was part of the 4 for 3 deal so I decided to try it. Well, my cat loves it! He stares at me whenever I wanna watch ""real"" tv and begs me to put his video on. So I usually give in. Now my other cat who doesn't watch much tv doesn't care too much for it. But if your cat loves to watch animals on tv, then they should love this video. I am so glad I got it! Its got birds, mice, frogs, lizards, squirrels, pigeons, ducks, geese, etc., and it lets you choose by animal or just watch the entire dvd. Nice feature. It's got nature sounds, nice clear pictures. It's really cute, even I enjoy watching it. Hope your cat will too!",cats,2
"I have bought a lot of coats and sweaters for my dogs and these are the best so far. The material is the perfect weight for our cold, but not freezing, nights (38-42 degrees). My dogs leave them on and actually come right up to get them put on at night. Every other coat, my one dog sheds off as fast as she can. The outside fabric keeps the wind off, while the inside is soft. It appears to be ""cheap"", but I think that the light weight is deceiving. They are holding up very well, are very easy to put on and take off, and the dogs seem warm and comfortable. Overall an excellent value.",dogs,3
"The shampoo that I previously used on my Dog has been discontinued for over a year (Sebolyt). After repeated failed attempts to acquire that shampoo, I ordered Sebolux . Upon using several other shampoos that made my dog's skin worse or no better (he had raw spots & scabbing), I ordered 3 bottles of the Sebolux. This shampoo has made a big improvement in my Soft coated Wheaten Terrier's skin condition & was also endorsed by my vet. Will continue to order & would like to be able to order in gallon quantities.",cats,2

"Thank God for the refills. My cat likes to catch the 'bird' and drag it off to his secret lair (i.e. under the coffee table). Since he's so active playing with it I like to leave him enjoy his prize. However, this doesn't bode well for how long the feathers last. He also gets revitalized with each new bird (probably cos the older ones get chewed up so fast).",cats,2
"I take in,rescue,re-home,rehabilitate and adopt out parrots - in particular the larger white cockatoos. On occasion I get in a bird with less than normal feathering and these perches make sure they stay nice and warm,although it rarely is very cold here in South Florida.I believe the ones giving this item a low score are the ones who allow their birds access to the wires while playing outside their cage,something this design was not intended for. No birds should have access to any kind of wire at any time! I certainly do hope I have educated my adopters to be smarter bird keepers than to do this,sooner or later these birds will get harmed.I have not used these perches for the largest of the 'Toos such as The U2 or M2,but have not had any problem with the quality of the plastic when used in cages holding SC2's,G2's,African Greys or Macaws.They should - as every item used in a bird environment - be checked for cracks or other sources of potential failure frequently,to avoid harm to the birds.I found the small size to work fine with birds of all sizes as long as it is not used as the birds' main perching spot. If used every day/night there must be other perching options in the cage,preferably made out of a variety of materials such as both hard and soft woods and rope,on different levels and in different areas of the cage.I would buy this again and have already recommended this item for others to purchase and use.",birds,0
"I am a German Shepherd breeder and this collar is the only collar that keeps my place queit at night. I have tried others that did little to no good. I currently have 7 of these and some are 3 years old and still going. I have not had one stop working on me.If you put it on and your dog still barks alot, you need to tighten an notch. If it still does not stop, tighten one more notch. I think some people may not be putting it on tight enough for thick coats.I do not think this is cruel at all. Dogs need boundaries.I take the collars off during the day and it has modified thier behavior tremendously.Also, if you buy the batteries from Amazon you will save a lot and they for some reason last longer.",dogs,3
"My Bengal loves this bed more than any other bed she's ever had. It gets so warm in there that she doesn't come out for hours at a time.

I was worried about cords, and other various type plug in styles, since I've seen proof of my doxies chewing through 'chew proof,' dog-proof,' and supposedly 'endless playtime' toys, among other objects. This was in-expensive, its very soft, and it's quite attractive material.",cats,2
"I purchased two of the units two years ago for three cats and am pleased with their operation - WHEN THEY WORK. The cats took to them with no issues and they have made litter control a two minute per week task. The shell and motors are well constructed, but the electronics are of questionable quality, or design. Both units failed last year within a week of each other (either power jack or circuit boards) within the warranty period. To the manufacturer's credit, they were quick to respond to my request for assistance and repaired both units quickly with little effort required on my behalf.One of the units failed again this week; not surprisingly, the culprit was either the power jack or circuit board. In the process of working out a repair. I requested a refurbished replacement unit, since my Litter Robot had been repaired by them less than a year earlier. I was told that the unit was out of warranty (true) and that they would send me parts to replace the faulty components-- they did not indicate that there would be a charge for the parts.This must be a common failure with this product. In both cases, I receive canned trouble shooting instructions, including offers for DYI replacement parts and link to a YouTube video demonstrating the repair. The control panel on the other unit I own does not work properly; the motion sensor and timer seem to function, but pressing the ""cycle"" button does nothing. I have to toggle the power switch to make it run.I will update this review after I fix the units and have a few months of experience with the repairs.",cats,2

"I love this carrier. It has a soft covering on top of a solid bottom. Three of the four sides are a strong, rubbery mesh which keeps kitty in. Both the top and one side open for easy access (definitely good when the occupant doesn't want to go in or out) and the other side has a pocket that you could stick little things in if you wished. Has both carrying handles and a shoulder strap to carry with. The sides are sturdy and the fabric is durable. My only complaint is that it is a bit small. I know I could have bought the next size up, so it is partly my fault.. I did measure and weigh my cat though to ensure that she met the standards. Although she was close to exceeding the size the guidelines, I thought it would be okay. She fits okay as long as she just hangs out and lays down (she can turn around if she tries). If in doubt and your pet is on the edge of the size guidelines, I would suggest moving up to the next size.",cats,2

"I just purchased this dog bed on eBay. I'm always skeptical because my 4 dogs are extremely destructive and don't take to new things very well. I can honestly say this is the best purchase I have made for my dogs in years. The construction is sturdy and all you need to put it together is a screw driver. It's so easy to assemble, it takes about 3 minutes.As soon as I put the Coolaroo bed outside on my porch, they were ALL over it. They absolutely love it. I actually bought another just a few minutes ago so that they would all be able to enjoy it, one isn't enough for 4 dogs. It's definitely a good size for one large dog and I believe it will truly support 150 lbs as the company claims.I think this dog bed is a must for people who love their dogs. It keeps them off the ground, away from bugs, dirt, etc. I also think older pets will truly benefit from this bed. I would imagine laying on the hard ground would be painful for dogs and other animals with arthritis and joint pain. This will help alleviate their pain by keeping them from laying on the ground and putting pressure on those painful spots. Also, this dog bed is definitely a plus for hot weather, keeping them cool. It's a mesh material so air flows freely under the bed and cools from the bottom as well. Both summer and winter are times to keep the pets off the ground and comfy.If your dog is resistant to this bed at first, try to coax them on it and reward them with praise and a treat. They will know it's a good thing if you spend a little time with them. Eventually, they will adore this bed like my 4 dogs do and you'll wonder why you didn't buy one sooner.",cats,2
"I have two mini-dachshunds who spend part of their day in a very large kennel. Mostly they are house and lap dogs and we take a few walks everyday. I don't mind when they bark in the house because it is usually to alert me to something. But when in the kennel they barked incessantly and at everything and anything...squirrels, cats, cars, people, a leaf blowing in the wind.Within an hour of wearing the collars in the kennel there was silence. Withina few days, the female no longer needed to wear the collar. The male has to wear his collar maybe once per week to remind him. The female has always been the smarter of the two. I leave the collars hanging on the kennel when not in use,and even this visual reminder seems to help. The collars are a little big and clunky on my 10 lb. dogs, but this isn't a serious issue. They are annoyed by the collars, but not uncomfortable.",dogs,3

It gives a slight jolt but didn't hurt, just surprised me and shut off my wind pipe making it impossible to make noise. I put it on my dog occasionally but he has learned. He barked once with it on and never again. Although he has learned that he can growl or do a light bark to get around it, it is no where near what his normal bark is. I would recommend this to others. I use it on a 15lb shitzu mix",dogs,3

Unlike some other brands, you will never find bugs, twigs, spider webs, or other nasty debris in their bird food. Their bird food is the most sanitary and immaculately prepared I have ever used. It has the pleasant and sweet aroma of a new harvest.This is the highest quality bird food you can buy. Your birds will love you for feeding them Hagen.

"The crate is okay. It has a divider and serves its purpose for a dog that is comfortable in a crate. The two-door design is nice. The metal wires are fairly flimsy, and I could see a determined dog destroying the crate and maybe getting hurt in the process. We use it for a puppy to sleep in at night. He is in the bedroom with us, so if he got too wild in the crate, I could address it. I would be hesitant to use this crate to separate dogs or for a high strung dog that will be left alone. I am writing this review because the crate actually cut me last night. I reached between the wires to move a toy inside the crate and caught my hand on a rough spot. I now have a three inch slice down the side of my hand. We have a PetMate crate for our other dog that seems much sturdier and safer without any pointy areas on the metal that could snag a human hand or a puppy paw. If your pup will be well behaved and not push the sides of this crate, it is probably okay, but if not, I would try another brand. I updated this and took away a star. I snagged my pants on another rough spot and ruined them. The company really needs to address the way the metal is connected and create smoother surfaces.",dogs,3

Our cat loved this mat and slept on it all the time. Problem was that he started losing hair on his stomach and his skin looked funny like he had a skin condition or rash. We took him to the vet and when she found out we had an electric heater pad she told us to stop using it. It took about 2 or 3 months but his hair has grown back. We kept the cover but threw away the electric heat. Just as we shouldn't sleep with an electric blanket neither should our pets.,dogs,3
"I've always known catnip had some strange magical hold on the feline population. I have had my cats for about a year and a half now, and after a brief stint with some grocery-bought ""catnip"" toys that didn't elicit a response, I had given up on the catnip miracle. Until, that is, I received this mat for Christmas.Both cats were enamored by this mat. Our female rolled all over it, drooling like a maniac. Our male preferred to try to eat the stuff. They'd both get mad at the idea of sharing and then we decided we needed to buy another...or two.The first night though, I had put the plastic catnip bag inside a larger bag with some other gifts, at the bottom. In the morning it was open and the catnip was strewn all over the floor. Earlier that morning our male was above my head in bed, drooling and kneading. I tried to move him, which usually causes him to jump off the bed but instead he fell next to my boyfriend and I on his back and dozed into a purring ecstasy. We realized why when we finally got up and assumed he ingested a great deal of the stuff, spiraling into the equivalent of a happy kitty overdose.",cats,2
"This mat has really helped with keeping the litter off my floors. I have two cats and since I purchased the mat it had cut down tremendously on the amount of litter they track all over the house.

Doesn't get it all and you have to shake mat off fairly often, but it is the best solution I have found for litter control. Would highly recommend this mat.",cats,2

This Kennel is HUGE!!! We purchased a 48x30x33 for an Akita puppy and to use when he is grown(110-120 pounds). I did not visualize just how large this would be- our 9yr (big guy for his age) 2 yr old son and puppy got in together -said it looked like a playhouse! I really like the divider it has been perfect to house train. The puppy loves it and goes to it to sleep. The kennel is sturdy and easy to assemble -our teenage sons put it together in three minutes. I highly suggest you purchase the casters (3x Midwest Universal Crate casters) so you can move it-we got six(two in a pack) as suggested by other customers with this size kennel- if you don't you will not be able to clean easily around it because it is so large to move. Give it 5 Stars- Great Value!,dogs,3
"I was getting ready to send these back and filled out the information for Amazon. I noticed you could buy a large size, so I thought there were two different size Andis blades. Not the case. These don't snap on like the package says, they slide on. The directions are incorrect and you must attach the two metal snap hooks to the bottom of the blade and then use your thumb(s) to slide the comb forward and along the top of the back of the blade until it snaps onto the teeth. It is actually simple once you know. These appear to be of high quality and made very well, so I expect these to last as long or longer than the clipper. I gave it one star because the idiots that sell these have not addressed the incorrect instructions on the package, nor have they modified the Amazon site to rectify the issue.

"I've been heavily involved in the aquarium hobby for about 40 years now. I was a little hesitant about ordering this filter after reading some of the negative comments here on Amazon. I was especially worried about the filter leaking. I called Marineland customer service and spoke to a rep about my worries regarding the leaking issue. He assured me that the leaking problems with this product line have long since been corrected. So I took a chance and ordered one. I'm very glad that I did. The filter is solid. Very well engineered. It's easy to set up and maintenance is very easy. Three large media containers give you a lot of versatility. I'm running this filter on a 50 gallon tank using Polyfilter, Chemipure, filter floss and Purigen in the media containers. I also run a Emperor 400 on the back of the tank. My tank was previously running using only the Emperor 400 and was never quite as clean as I wanted it to be. Since adding the C-160 my water is crystal clear. This filter is also completely silent. You can't hear a thing unless you put your ear right up against the canister. I recommend this filter to everyone.",fish aquatic pets,4

From time to time (rarely), the wheel slows down or starts and stops, but I've always managed to get it going again.I recommend this as a very good product.Something has changed because the picture on here does not match what I have.

Then it just stopped working, and the dog continued to bark away. I filled it with more citronella, tested it by blowing on the microphone, and it clicks like it's going to release citronella but it never does. Amazon won't take it back because it has pressurized gas, and I don't see any contact information for the manufacturer to see if they'll replace it. Also, the plastic buckle is really flimsy and let's the collar loosen. Bummer that companies can get away with not standing behind their products.",dogs,3

Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst! - KV Pet Supply has the best online price- $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!",dogs,3

"Mushers Secret protects our Schnauzer against the Chicago cold throughout the winter. While it provides some protection against salt getting into his paw pads, it really is not a complete solution and it does not eliminate the need to clean dirty feet upon reentry into your home(try disposable boots for this). However, if your dog hates shoes as much as ours does, Mushers Secret will solve 80% of your needs.Mushers Secret does not stain rugs and furniture, but you can see little footprints if you look at the right angle on hardwood floors (easily cleaned up).",cats,2
After searching the internet for weeks I just got lucky when I happened upon this item while purchasing another item on Amazon.com. I needed a suitable outdoor gate/fence to keep my little Orielle confined on the front porch when I am busy inside. Ori is a Miniature Australian Shepherd so the height of these panels is tall enough that she can't jump over and low enough that I can get myself over without too much effort. It was easy to assemble and can be used as either a pen or stretched out as a gate. It's lightweight making it easy to move around when necessary. It's durable and easy to keep clean - I just hose it off from time to time. And it's quite attractive - doesn't make the front of my house look like a fortress. It's plastic so I don't have to bring it in when it rains. Many people walking past my house have commented on the fence and some of them have bought one as well.,dogs,3

"I have a mixed breed dog that i've been told is a mix of maybe a portuguese sheepdog and a schnauzer. He has an undercoat and fur that gets long, about 2-3 inches, that gets matted so easily, and its a wonderful transport for outside grass into my home. I bought this brush along with another brush to try out and this one has by far been the most useful. I will pick a section of his fur and start gently brushing at it little by little and the fine teeth start to undo the mats and pull out any lingering grass... You can't press on it too hard or it will easily get to his skin so you have to be careful about that, those teeth are sharp! My dog is such an attention err..hog and he loves his brushings. When he has no mats, this just slide through his fur and he loves it. I imagine it feels like light scratching. I pull out tons of fur but it comes off the brush easily enough.",cats,2

"I was disappoint in this product. The Pet Pen is a wonderful bed for my little dog chico who weighs about 6 pounds. I had another one, but it was destroyed from a bursted pipe in the ceiling. This one was to replace the destroyed one because Chico loved his bed. When I received it the packaging was great and it had a nice bag for the pen. However the hooks on the bottom was very hard to get down and one on the top will not latch into place. I needed this pen immediatly so I couldn't send it back. I would recommend this product even though mine was broke. I could have sent it back, and Amazon I'm sure would have made it right, but I didn't have time. Chico needed a bed, and he loved it anyway.",dogs,3

"My Maltese has been taking this product for almost three months. She had dark brown stains covering her entire face from eyes down. She is 13 lbs, and I have been giving her a scant teaspoon every day. After a few days of treatment I noticed that her eyes were very watery, but with clear tears. Excess watering stopped after another couple of days and she has had no more staining since that time. New hair is growing in white and she looks like her beautiful self again.

"I bought the Lazy Pet Plush Condo for my three cats - all are between 9 & 13 lbs. The two larger cats could not fit comfortably in this, but none of them were interested anyways. They tried it once or twice and then it sat in the house for months never to be touched again. I gave it to my mom for her cats. Again, they looked at it a few times and lost interest. We finally donated it to charity. Besides the lack of interest from the cats, the design is rather flimsy. I suspect this is why my cats didn't like it. When they tried to sit on top of it, it would shake unsteadily. When they leaned against it to scratch, it wobbled. I think for the money you could find a much better product.",cats,2
"To be honest I have not bought these but who in there right mind would? 10 pack for $6-7? I don't think so! My puppy came into heat, I bought the washable covers that the liners go in.

The great thing about buying Panty pads/liners instead of these is that you can buy higher absorbency Ones, So if you're using it for urine accidents it won't be as messy. Simple solution you have a great concept but way overpriced.",dogs,3
I've had these boxes for years (I replace them yearly for sanitary purposes). I think they're great but they do get messy. The cats still have a tendency to go right underneath the opening which has them stepping in/out the messed area. The one star drop however is because my small dogs have finally figured out how to get in. Granted it took them years to figure it out and they were defeated by my placing the boxes behind a gate. But then again - I could've put any boxes behind a gate and my cats could've used the whole open space more easily.,cats,2
"It took forever to fit. The buckle lay right behind the leg. I fiddled around to adjust the fit but the strap is still close behind the leg.

Not available on Amazon. It is beautifully made with velvet lining on the chest strap. It is a lot easier to adjust and fit and in my opinion is a better design. It has the pull front ring on the chest and also a martingale pull ring on the back. I walked my dog in it and she did great. I am training my dog to heel and this harness makes it an easier job. For a few extra dollars the Freedom no pull harness is worth it.For those of you who like the Easy Walk Harness.

"I have the large Petmate waterer and I love that one. The pump went out after about four years of continuous use. When I saw the price on the linen colored one, I thought instead of buying another large, I'd try this medium size.Maybe it is the item I have vs. the entire medium size, but the top is extremely hard to take off, the reservoir doesn't empty very quickly, and the water flow seems to be all or very little. Furthermore the depth of the drinking well is so shallow that the water level drops so quickly that I have to check it several times a day to make sure there is enough water for the pump to work efficiently. And as other reviewers have noted, it seems to get dirty faster than it should.The reason I gave it a two star rating rather than a one star is because I took the pump out of it and replaced the nonworking one in my large Petmate which I would give five stars to vs. this highly inefficient medium one! Who knew that there was such a difference between a medium and a large water fountain from the same manufacturer and same line?",cats,2

"I was looking for Mr. Bill stuff, and came across this plush dog toy. My daughter has a combination lab and pit bull, and she's always needing new toys for her dog, so I bought this item for her.This is a great dog toy, for those of you who appreciate the sick humor of Mr. Bill. When squeezed, the plushie goes ""Oh Nooooooo..."" instead of the usual squeaky noise. My daughter loved it, her dog loved it, and all was well with the road.Unfortunately, after a day of dog play, the mutt managed to bite -through- the squeaker, rendering Mr. Bill mute. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't blame the Mr. Bill plushie for this problem. This dog has been known to eat remote controls - literally. The dog can tear through a large rawhide toy in a day.So, if you are planning on buying this plushie, perhaps you should consider a slightly smaller dog. And perhaps the manufacturer might consider making the internal squeaker a little more like Mr. Bill himself - who can take everything you can dish out and keep right on saying, ""Oh Nooooooo....""All said and done, I like this item very much.",dogs,3
Mi Chi kept scratching at his ears. I tried other stuff and wasn't for sure if he had mites or not. So I decided just to buy and see if it helped him. Wow!

"I've been buying Grizzly Salmon Oil through Amazon for a couple of years, since I discovered that I could get fish oil for the dogs cheaper this way than from local pet stores. Up until now, I ordered the quart size, so I was happy to see that I could get it in this larger size bottle, still with the pump dispenser, so I don't have to order quite as often. Thanks to Amazon, I can order it and get it in two days, so the dogs don't ever have to go without. I put it on the dogs' kibble, and they wait to dig into their food until I do! They love it, and it makes their coats shiny. We recently adopted an older dog, Bailey, a chocolate lab, who has severe arthritis in her hind legs. She used to have a hard time getting around. She now runs around in the back yard with the younger dog, and can stand up on her hind legs to scratch the patio door when she wants in. The improvement in her agility could be due to the glucosamine-chondroitin tablets she gets twice a day, but I think the salmon oil helps too.",dogs,3
"I was so excited when I bought this toy, imagining the hours my dog would spend entertaining herself with this toy.

"I've had this cat litter box for well over a year now, close to two years, I believe. It's not perfect, but it's way ahead of whatever is in second place. I've had no problem with warping or anything like that, but the caveat is that if your cats are like mine, they will not leave it alone. The fake mulch will disappear, eventually. They'll claw it out, you'll find it in a corner of a room and put it back, until eventually it disappears altogether. I never could find a solution to this problem. A pity, but I can live with that -- it doesn't need the mulch. They will not leave the leaves alone either. A few leaves are somewhat rattier looking than when I first bought it -- but still, it looks good enough, a hundred times better than a regular cat box, and in my two-room apartment, that factor alone is very much worth the price. The new picture on Amazon now looks as if the leaves are different than the one I originally bought -- somewhat higher off the ground, which may help the problem. This item is a very nice solution if you can't hide a cat box, and if mine ever wears out, I will certainly be looking to see if Amazon still carries it.",cats,2

Bucket seats would probably be better. Overall, though, I'm glad I bought this product, despite the hilarious comments from my friends.",dogs,3

"We have two cats that are somewhat petite. Their waste looks pretty normal, but somehow much of it just finds its way through the tines of the rake and remains behind in the box and gets dragged around. I've read that this product doesn't work for cats that don't burry their poo. I have to agree and would be surprised if it worked even if they did burry them.To watch this unit slide the solid waste all the way to the end and then watch the waste slip down back into box rather than get flipped into the bin was frustrating. Watching the waste that slipped though the gap get raked backwards all the way the start and seeing it pinned against the wall was just plain grose! And we turned the unit on manually a good hour after they did their business. There was no reason for it not work. I even ran it three times in a row and it just could pick them all up and actually made matters a little worse each time, ending with the stuff pinned all the way back behind the rakes up against the wall.The tines of the rake are just too short and too flimsy. Why else would solid waste nearly make it up into the bin and drop back down into the litter? After all the years this product has been in existence I'm shocked to see it perform as it does. This unit was returned.I said at first that I was done with this brand, but I have to now retract that statment! I took a chance on the more expensive LitterMaid ELITE MegaLitterMaid Elite LME9000 Mega Advanced Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Boxbecause I wasn't interested in buying the $20 crystal trays that went with an alternate brandScoop Free LB1 Self-Cleaning Litter Boxand I could tell by looking that it was much better made. I'll probably post a separate review but I can tell you that the ELITE Mega has a superior design and so far nothing has slipped past the rake or even gotten stuck.I maintain that the LM 600 is not even worth trying unless perhaps your cat has enormous sized droppings. I personally wouldn't consider any of them that had a flimsy plastic rake, especially now that I've seen the metal rake actually work as one would expect.",dogs,3

I really like the product. I researched many of the expensive self cleaning litter boxes. Many had bad reviews. This litter box had good reviews and no moving parts. It was also a lot cheaper than the others. We got a kitten and I was afraid it would be too big for him to get in and out of but it isn't. I tend to clean the litter box more often than i did with my previous litter box because it is easier. Very happy with the product for the price. Would have given it 5 stars but the clips are a little hard to open and close when you need to (though I don't need to do it unless I am adding litter).,cats,2
These were perfect for my dog. The bag contained all FULL-SIZED ears (no slivers or little chunks).

"I purchased this crate and initially thought it was great. It seems very well built and it set up in just a moment. However, my dog chewed through it and escaped the FIRST time I left him in it. The only time my dog ever chews is when I leave him so I guess I should have known. So buyer beware, if your dog chews, opt for a metal crate.",dogs,3
"So the product does not appear particularly sturdy. I have to worry that if my dogs pull hard enough, the plastic clips will break. I had also hoped it would derail some of the pulling, but it doesn't at all. It does free up my hands, which is nice, but I still have to grab the leash portion to correct them when they pull, so I might as well just be holding the leash.If you are a serious runner who is concerned about form and your dog is already reasonbly good on the leash, this might be perfect for you. However, if you are a haphazard jogger with 2 80lb idiots (one of whom has a crazy obsession with the neighbor's donkey statue), then you'll probably want to pass on this. I barely use it and I would have sent it back if I hadn't lost the packaging.",dogs,3

"Despite reading all of the bad reviews my husband and I decided to give the LitterMaid Elite a chance. We are a two cat household and I thought it would be so nice to have a little litter box duty relief. And it would have been, had the littermaid actually worked at all.Just like the reviews above stated the rake simply is non functional. The very first time our cat pooped in it the rake was unable to push it up into the waste receptacle. We tried everything. We put less litter in, then we tried filling the litter box up more (which did improve the success rate to about 50% mind you). Also, we noticed our sensors were not detecting the cats every time they went in it. So half the time the thing didn't even attempt to scoop it.This product really is a piece of overpriced trash. They obviously did not do any sort of consumer testing before putting the new ""elite"" model on the market. Or maybe they did and just didn't care.Thankfully Petsmart has a very generous return policy. We were able to take it back.",cats,2
"I owned two of the older LitterMaids for several years. While not perfect, at least they worked. Recently, one stopped working and wasn't worth fixing. So I thought I'd replace it with the new LME model. WRONG MOVE.First, much of the plastic on the LME model is flexible. Unfortunately, flexible isn't always good. Second, there are no latches on this so the top just sits on the pan portion. Third, the slope where the rake sits in ""home"" position means that stuff gets trapped behind the rake until you scoop it out yourself. Fourth, the rake no longer moves far enough over the receptacle to properly work; much of what's raked up falls right back into the pan. Fifth, mine stopped working after just a few months; the rake/motor unit gets stuck and just sits in the same place, making a clicking sound. Taking the unit apart, cleaning it, adjusting the position of the rake/motor did nothing. So now I've got what amounts to a manual box.I recently replaced this dud with the older LM920 box. Am buying a couple more of those just in case.",cats,2

"I am very happy with this feeder. I work full time and attend school some nights right after work, leaving my poor kitty alone and hungry all day (you do NOT leave a tortie with an empty plate or you will definitely hear about it when you get home!)My cat also used to start meowing as soon as my alarm clock goes off at 5:30 am, and if you are like me, you like to press ""Snooze"" a few more times before getting out of bed...wellll that doesn't fly when kitty wants her food first thing in the morning! I set this feeder to start dispensing at 6, so now she doesn't cry for me to feed her because she's fed before I'm even out of bed :)A bit on the expensive side, but it's really really worth it. I love that it plugs in/has an ac adapter as opposed to some battery operated feeders. Timer is very easy to set, just make sure you are properly measuring how much food comes out per how many seconds depending on kibble size, so as not to overfeed. My tortie would eat her weight in food and more if she could, even though she's a little thing.Most importantly, if I am staying at my bf's or my parents' house overnight, I don't have to rely on someone to come feed my cat anymore. This feeder has made life so much easier! I recently got a second kitty, and I saw how some reviewers made a dividing tube to dispense into two dishes...I may be doing that in the near future to ensure that they both get fed after the kitten comes off of kitten food. The only problem is making sure my older cat, who is only a year and a half, doesn't eat the kitten's share before he gets to.",cats,2
"I purchased this collar for my beagle mix that pulls constantly on walks and forget it if another dog walks by! I had tried her regular collar, then a harness, neither did much good. This collar has worked well, she is much better (still pulls at the beginning of the walk but calms down quickly). I can adjust this high on her neck if I anticipate an incident (like another dog), and she really has no choice but to comply. The only thing that I don't care for is that I have to adjust it after is is on and again to take it off, I wish it just snapped together so it was always adjusted. I only use this collar for our walks, usually 3 times a day, so that means I have to adjust it 6 times a day. Having said that, I won't walk her without this collar, so I will tolerating the hassle of adjusting it every time. Our walks so much more pleasant.",dogs,3

It fits her small body just right and keeps her nice & cozy on cold mornings. It doesn't slip or impede her movement so she basically forgets she has it on. It even has a hole on back to attach the leash to her harness underneath. The best part... it's super cute & adorable! I can't recommend this product enough for a small dog.

You won't be disappointed with this leash. It is long enough so your dog can run ahead of you but strong so she will be safe. It doesn't tangle and has a really good braking system.I always worried the cord type leash would come undone or snap. No worries with this one. Great idea that really works!,dogs,3

"The Eclipse Hex 5 is an elegant solution for those who want a very small aquarium to place in a very small space. The in-hoo filter and lght keeps things simple. The system is quiet and works great.But the Hex 5 also has some previously unmentioned design features which are of interest:1. The Filter and Light are on separate power cords.This is a great idea so that you dont have to shut off the light and the filter at the same time, I was worried about this but they cam through!2. The Filter medium can't go anaerobic when shut off.The filter system is an overflow design which exposes the filter to air on all sides. It's not encased in a cannister so it cannot go anaerobic when the filter is turned off. This is important for those who don't want to run the filter all the time.3. Bright light for your plants.The tank hood has a built in 20 watt CF fixture, (4 watts/gal.) so even though the tank is tall and narrow your plants will get plenty of light even at the bottom.4. Little surface agitation.At least when used without the biowheel. this is important for those keepling planted aquaria and trying to preserve the CO2 level.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies. I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food. I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve. His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks. He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor. We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea. Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.",dogs,3
"My pooch is 28lbs, about the stature of a Cocker Spaniel. I put Zukes treats inside and he loves his new toy! See my pups' video review.

"I was so pumped for this thing! Day one, I woke up to find happy, fed rabbits who finally left me alone while I slept in. Day two, I set it out at night for the following morning. Barely a couple minutes later I heard a noise, looked over, and saw them happily munching away on lettuce. Oh no! I must have not pushed the lid down and set it right.So I reset it, jostled it a bit to make sure it was secure, and set it back down. A minute later, there they were again breaking into the next day's breakfast. I bought the 2 meal version and each tray has a lip that extends down front from under the lid. All they need to do is jimmy that a bit and it pulls right out from the lid. See the user photo with the cat demonstrating to you what your pet will do. If they haven't figured it out yet, it's only a matter of time. Completely useless. My trusty UPS guy came by yesterday with my label to return it. I hope I can find a version of this that actually does its job.",cats,2

"We bought 2 of these collars, one for our 12lb mix and one for our 30lb Beagle. With the extra links from the smaller dog, we were able to make the collar fit for the larger one as well. These work really well, and have helped a lot with both of their pulling which makes walking them together a breeze. This has enough ""bite"" to startle the dogs, but not too much to hurt them. Sometimes during play the collar will snap off but has never broken so it is very easy to snap the collar back on. Great product!",dogs,3

"These harnesses are functional and stylish. I bought one because my dog likes to jump around the car, which is pretty distracting and probably not safe. Using this also helps contain his shedding to one area of the car.The harness can be used as a seat belt or a walking harness, which makes travelling in the car a breeze. I also feel that in the event of a car accident, my dog would probably be safe since the chest area is padded with fake shearling, and wouldn't choke him like a regular collar would. The shearling is pretty soft and luxurious.My only gripe, which I'm not even sure is fixable, is that the clip still allows my 10 lb dog to twist into a tangled mess, until he can't really move around. This causes the spoiled brat to start crying, which can be annoying if we are no where near our destination. However, I still feel that the overall objective of maintaining dog safety makes this purchase well worth it.",dogs,3

I have also noticied a big difference in the amount of hair that I find in my house. So much less! I would recommend but I still think it's a bit pricey.

"Just put together 2 beds. They seem sturdy and look good but the dogs have not used them yet. This post is to add to the assembly instructions. Putting it together with two people will make it easier. Took us about 5 minutes per bed. (You certainly can put it together by yourself.) The instructions that came with my beds showed slightly different parts than came in the box. Mine had 2 side tubes (the long side) and 4 legs. The instructions show 2 types of sidebar/leg tubes that join in the middle. There was no comment in the instructions as to which side of the tube should be to the outside. While the bed will go together either way, if you put the flatter side (where the bolt goes) towards the fabric, the bolt will not extend past the side bar. As others have said, to get the final bolt in, put in 3 bolts and leave them loose. This will let you twist the frame, without bending any tubes, and easily put in the last bolt.",cats,2

Amazon was great about taking them back the first time and sending replacements -- but the replacements were wrong too and I finally gave up. (When I looked at the tags, I saw the tags on Hillary were mistakenly labeled and bar coded as the George W. ones; it's clear all they do is scan that rather than actually looking at what they're packing and making sure it matches the order.) But if Amazon were to contact me and say they're sure they fixed this, I'd order them again in a flash!",dogs,3

"After trying all the tricks to control incessant barking (exercise, attention and love, distraction), I finally resorted to this collar. One week ago today, I put it on the dog, a coonhound nearing 1 year of age with a big bark and coon whine. On the first day, I stayed out of doors with her for the first few hours. Yes she barked once, then a little yelp, then I verbally corrected her ""Quiet"". She did this 5 more times, same thing. Then the big bark, bark, bark--she stopped looked dismayed and took herself to her crate (which is always open--her ""safe"" place). She didn't bark again the rest of the day. Nine barks and she was done. I put the collar on her for 12 hours at a time, 4 days in a row. No more barking. She runs, chases the birds (when she'd get into the incessant barking), watches the neighborhood children and walkers (also a barking cue)--but no barking. Now all our interactions are positive ones--lots more petting time, praising time, treats and other good things. On day 5, 6 and today, I have not put the collar on and she seems to be over her barking fits. She's completely playful and friendly. I have continued to exercise this dog daily not depending on the collar to be the entire solution. By the way, I did try out the collar on my thigh and it is much like a static shock. I am now more ashamed of the continuous verbal reprimands that I gave my dog over the months than I am of the collar that corrected her nine times. There are no skin issues on my dogs neck from these shocks. I agree with other comments that the collar itself is thin and cheap--but I had a back up one to replace it if necessary. I am grateful for this tool to restore happiness to our household.",dogs,3
Perfect size for training. Easy to break in half (or smaller) for smaller dogs and toy breeds. Haven't found any dogs yet who have turned them down. I appreciate the quality of the ingredients. It's not easy to find good treats which don't require refrigeration. These are small and soft and perfect for class. They have enough smell/taste appeal to compete with other normal training class environment. I've purchased these in a number of flavors for use in classes and with my own dogs. I recommend them to my students because of the quality and convenience.,dogs,3
"We had recently gotten a female German Shepard and found her at the bottom of our driveway one day after we had been playing with her and then got side tracked with something else. Right then we decided we needed to buy a fence to keep her contained because we don't like to hook our pets out. We were searching for a fence of some kind and came across the petsafe fence. We are so glad we found this!! Shelby can go out and run in the yard and she know's where her boundaries are and stays in the dooryard.

"I was desperate to find a way to keep my cats from shredding the new chairs. I ordered this product and it saved my sanity and my kitties digits! they were used to being clipped, so they sat fairly patiently while I glued the tips on. I pre-filled them with glue (according to directions)and just popped them on one at a time. I was really surprised at how quickly my kitties ""forgot"" about them. There are so many tips in the package and you only need to do the front paws, so if you lose one or two in the first few days it is no problem. They seem to lose about one a week with natural shedding, but I just replace it in a second. They are inexpensive and fun looking! Interesting outcome is that since they can't ""get a grip"" on my chairs they have completely lost interest in them. They do get a nice grip on the scratching posts (and the carpet, harmlessly) so they get their scratching ""fix."" THE alternative to declawing!",cats,2
"I have cats who love to scratch and despite many scratching posts, they preferred scratching the corners of our leather couch, at least until I bought a couple of the Ultimate Scratching Posts. I put one by each of the back corners of the couch and the cats totally ignore the couch now, preferring the scratching posts. The Ultimate does not shed, it doesn't get ugly bare spots like the carpeted ones, and it doesn't get knocked down, ever, even with a cat putting all its weight against it!I used to have piles of ripped carpet and shredded rope scattered all around the bottom of the old style scratching posts, but the floor around the Ultimate Scratching Posts is perfectly clean; it's a joy!This scratching post is very good looking and sturdy and a perfect solution to my scratching problems. I highly recommend it.September 2009 Update - These posts still look as good as the day they arrived and continue to be very popular. The cats are not interested in scratching anywhere else.December 2011 Update - It's been almost three years since I purchased the first of several of these scratching posts. The most popular one is now ripped to shreds and torn at the corners. When I stuck my finger through to the post core I discovered that the fabric is so much thicker than I would have imagined. The other ultimate scratching posts are doing great although one of them looks a little wrinkled and saggy like it wasn't properly adhered to the post from the start, but it is still doing its job. I am hoping to reupholster the badly torn one with some sisal fabric remnants that I obtained online and that should make it good as new. These posts outlast the rug types that can look ratty in just a few short weeks. Considering my cats love these ultimate posts and use them often, I am a very happy and satisfied customer.",cats,2
"This costume is cheaply made, but that is not the worst of it. It is definitely not true to size. I bought a size small for my 12-pound dachshund. He fits the measurements for that size according to the official sizing information. This costume is SO BIG that I triple-checked all the tags and packaging, which all say size small! I tried this on my 25-pound Beagle, and it doesn't even fit her! She fell out of it right away as it dragged along the floor. The velcro pieces don't match up either. There is a long strip of velcro on the back that they expect you to attach to a tiny half inch circle of it on the other side.Not worth it unless you plan to do a complete re-fitting and alteration.",dogs,3

"I had Big Dog water fountain for a little over 2 years for my 3 cats. The fountain was good, however, I had a piece break about a year into use. It was not a vital part (the switch to make faster or slower water flow) so I kept it. The Big Dog fountain was hard to clean and very clumsy. I bought all of the tools that Drinkwell sells and did not have an easier time. I found myself not wanting to re-fresh their bowl, which is unfortuate.I moved and did not want to move Big Dog so I looked for a new fountain. I found this one on Amazon and really liked the videos I watched on YouTube for this product. Plus I liked that the unit is dishwasher safe. This fountain is quieter than Big Dog, smaller than Big Dog, and much easier to clean. Plus I like the hair catcher. The fountain is shorter so my cats have to bend their necks further, which is not a deal at all - I should hope. My cats love the fountain as much as they loved the last. I do not use all of the Drinkwell cleaning pieces with this unit - most used is the middle sized brush. The pieces come apart for easy clean, which less clumsy than Big Dog. It uses the same filters as the other fountains like Big Dog, which is also good because they are sometimes hard to come by.My only complaint is the size of the reserve tank. I wish it held as much as the Big Dog tank did. This is not a big deal at all because it is super easy to fill and replace.",cats,2
"We purchased two of these items. Both have stopped working and now the neighbor's cat sits underneath our bird feeders and uses our children's sandbox as a litter box. Last night, the cat left us part of a rodent's body by our back door. The cat stop worked wonderfully for a couple of months so we bought a second one for underneath the bird feeders. Now we're out the $ and don't know what to do so that the cat will stay away.",cats,2
"After researching and reading many reviews on various sites (and having used other comparable products - mainly Littermaids), I am am not only thrilled with this litterbox, but so are my cats. The unit is a breeze to clean between changes, is much quieter, and so much easier to handle while cleaning and changing cartridges (Littermaid litterally was a chore!). The most fascinating thing about this box is how my much cats love it. With other units, once I cleaned the unit and changed the litter, the cats would come running which would last an hour of so. Now I have one cat that actually sleeps next to the box in the bathroom, she loves it so much.I agree with other reviewers that the additional price is a bit hard to swallow, but the low tracking litter and ease of cleaning both the box itself and the surrounding areas really makes up for it. I agree that stirring the litter 1-2 times a day extends the life of the cartridge and so far each one has lasted 12-14 days with 2 young healthy cats. I have yet to try the ""Forever Cartridge"" found on eBay, but may give it a shot sometime soon to see if I can reduce my overall costs. (I did contact Scoop Free and they have no interst in creating such an item at this time.)Overall opinion... buy it, you won't be disappointed.",cats,2
"There are a plethora of disinfectants that you can choose to use for the shelter environment in terms of cleaning and disinfecting. Disinfectants can come in my shapes and sizes, including costs and modes of application. Until very recently it was very common to look only at the method of cleaning and the steps followed to reach sanitation. But now it is becoming more and more important to not only look at the method and steps to reach sanitation, but also the disinfectant used and the way it is applied.First there are your quart products namely called Quaternary Ammonium Compounds which are a disinfectant/detergent based disinfectant. These products are great for your standard cleaning of surfaces such as walls, but in terms of destroying infectious pathogens in the shelters, they ultimately fail. They are only effective against enveloped viruses such as Feline Herpes Virus. Quart products are not at all effective against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus and calcivirus which are your more deadly viruses that are hard to kill.Then there are your Potassium Peroxymonosulfate products which are your Trifectant and Virkon. Potassium Peroxymonosulfate the main ingredient in Trifectant is the gold standard in eliminating Feline Calcivirus, Feline Herpes Virus and canine parvo virus in shelters due to its great activity against organic matter and ease of application. Despite that, a pre-cleaning step with detergent mix and brushing along with rinsing is always advised to remove as much organic matter as possible before using this product. This is true with any disinfectant. With the pre-cleaning step and Trifectant being applied the right way, you will find that this does the job very accurately and leaves a better scent than bleach does.Before you can trust this product, lets realize how URI is spread. It is somewhat airborne, cats can sneeze five feet. But is is mainly fomite contacted which means it is spread by food bowls, water bowls, litter boxes and stainless steel cages improperly cleaned between cats. Any item that is touched and touched again. This is why you need this product.Please note that different situations call for different disinfectants such as in the case of ringworm. But for daily cleaning I would choose this product over anything. It lasts for seven days for each solution. It is a great deal for a great price. I use this at home to disinfect everything between my regular cats and foster and will use it to sanitize the foster cage in-between litters.This product is the best.",dogs,3

I have a total of 3 ortho beds in the apartment and the Pet Gear Nature's Foundation Pet Bed is not only an easy care product, smells good.........the cats love it!!!! That cute, sturdy cover just unzips quickly for washing. And if you need to spot clean the cover, it holds up very well. After the first washing, it still felt and looked brand new! I did add another piece of ortho foam between the pop corn mattress and the cedar pouch - and that's no small cedar pouch! It is the size of the product and smells great! I added the extra foam for extra support as the pop corn mattress is not as thick as I would have liked. As long as kitties are happy, I am happy! Of course, there was the fast Amazon shipping.

"Used this product for my 4 year old 95 pound Rottweiler who had been limping for months and we saw multiple vets with no idea what the problem was. I found that this item had great reviews so I purchased a bottle with low expectations. In just a couple of weeks we saw major improvement and now he isn't limping at all. I continue to give him one tablet a day and he can run and play for hours with our smaller dog with no signs of lameness. Recently purchased the bottle for dogs unbder 60 pounds to keep our boxer cross healthy. Would highly recommend that people give this a try. Plus, my dogs think its a treat!",dogs,3
"Upon opening the package, our cat immediately began scratching the pad, then discovered the ball and was incensed that he couldn't get it out of the track. Very funny to watch. While he's not as intrigued with the ball after 2 months, the scratching pad is attacked regularly. Good entertainment for us people to watch. Good outlet for the cat.",cats,2

"I bought this after realizing that my dog's ears were irritated after her routine bath. I tried a vinegar-water mix but after the first attempt to pour it in her ear, she was determined to not let try again and she kept running away. I looked up a few products online and found this to be the best option. I liked that it was natural, soothing, and seemed relatively easy to use.As soon as I received it, I tried it on my dog. She was reluctant, as she is with any other medical intervention, so I ended up squirting the bottle while she was standing. I thought it might not work but I was surprised to see ear debris coming out. I was shocked at how much debris was in her ear, but very glad that the solution was clearing it up for her. I did the squirting process twice. For the creme, I poured some onto a tissue and pushed it in my dog's ears to massage them in. Thankfully, she didn't mind this process. After I put the drying creme formula into her ear, she shook around a little more and then finally settled down. The entire process was difficult with my anxious dog but it worked very well. Afterwards, she was no longer scratching her ear as intensely after the solution treatment. Also, her ears did not smell bad nor were they red anymore!I know my dog doesn't care for this product but I love it. If you have a dog who doesn't like having things poured into their ear, this may be a little difficult, but you should try it anyway because it is so effective. Forget spending hundreds at the vet for an ear wash.So to recap...Pros:1. Natural.2. Smells good.3. Very effective.Cons:1. Could be difficult to use, depending on your dog.",cats,2

"This particular product didn't do anything for my 3 indoor cats who sporadically got fleas. The fleas loved my kitten and he was covered. We washed them and applied the product and the fleas were back on the next day. The next time around I bought Frontline Plus from Amazon and that worked right away. I don't know if this was an old batch or maybe the Plus made a difference (although I thought it just protected against ticks as well) but either way I wouldn't buy this one again. I only spent a few more dollars for the ""plus"" version and it was worth EVERY penny.",cats,2
"I bought the Sporn No Pull Harness for my young yellow lab puppy. It did seem to help somewhat with her pulling, but the straps are very thin and dug into her skin every time she pulled (which is always). The black dye rubbed off on her light fur leaving two big black smudges on her chest and a black X across her back. Quite annoying - I had to scrub it pretty well with soap to try to get it off, only to have the problem recur every time I put it on her. I emailed the company to tell them of the problem and NEVER got a response. I guess the factory in China makes it out of material that is not colorfast and apparently Sporn doesn't care! If you have a light colored dog, then expect the color to rub off on their fur!! Also the fleece sleeves are not attached to the straps and came off every time I tried to put the harness on my dog. Also quite annoying to have to deal with that while my dog is jumping around anxiously anticipating her walk! I ended up stitching it to the strap to prevent the problem. Seems to me that is a solution that could easily be taken care of in production. I ended up scrapping the Sporn and buying an Easy Walk harness instead. Much better quality product that fits better, doesn't bleed on my dog's fur and stops her from pulling!!!!",dogs,3
"The house is a good size and well made. I like it better than Harriet the cat, who took some time getting used to it. She stays outdoors and it's great to have a designated place for her.

"If your cat ignores the teensy weensy type of cat toys and wants something to really sink his teeth *and claws!* into... get the BIG apple... not only is it stuffed with great catnip, but the fabric is a heavy duty quality that holds up well to cat-fight-play...He just loves the Yeowwww! line of toys, I've ordered the lemon (probably his favorite) and recently added the Rainbow and Banana, to see how he likes those. Usually he likes toys that will roll *so he can give chase...All cat toys should be observed for signs of wear but I feel safer that this is nothing but quality heavy-duty fabric and catnip. And that's it.Well done, duckyworld, and I'm telling all my friends about this great line of toys!!!",cats,2
"I read about this product online from other owners of Shih Tzu dogs. From the first time I used it I realized that I was finally able to get my dog as ""clean"" as the groomers did without having to pay $50+ each time he went to see them. Now he only has to go when it is time for a hair cut.I highly recommend this product to anyone with a dog that has an oily coat. It is important to realize that you do need to put this on your dog for a few minutes before you get the dog wet and before you shampoo.",dogs,3
The scat mat is fantastic!!! I bought this to keep the cats of my new convertible. They loved to climb on top and perch themselves on the canvas top.

I highly recommend the scat mat.,dogs,3
"I am actually buying this bark collar a second time because the first one finally gave out.The first time I purchased this collar my dog barked, once, then twice, and then did a kind of yelp bark.About ten minutes later she barked once again. And this is the great part, she NEVER BARKED AGAIN.She was a big barker.I only knew the collar broke because it has been over a year and she suddenly started to bark again, just a little and now she has figured out it won't zap her so she has started to resume her bad habits. So, I am ordering a new one.This is one good product and I highly recommend it.",dogs,3
"I purchased this product from PetCo fo considerably more than it's price on Amazon(I was in a bit of a rush, please don't hurt me for not taking the time to find the best price). After owning dogs my entire life, I've been constantly searching for a container that will keep the smell locked up. My two St. Bernards eat very high end dog food, the disadvantage to organics and natural dog foods, they smell very, very strongly. And since I have St Bernards that eat impossible amounts of food, it's silly to buy anything other than (2) 36 pound bags at a time. But, it's been a huge struggle to find a container that is big enough to hold that much food, and also seals completely to lock the smell away so that my whole house doesn't constantly smell lik dog food. This one id the trick. Obviously the amount it will hold depends on the density and size of the food you purchase, but mine (I own the 50 pound size) perfectly fits Two 36 pound backs of Before Grain dog food. Way more than the 50 pounds it says. It's also very durable and just feels like it's high quality. It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Also, the fact that the top screws down nice and secure to keep the food fresh. I just love this thing and it has provided a solution to a problem that I have had for a while. I'm thinking about Switching to the 80 pound version so that I can just have petfooddirect.com ship me all 5 bags once every 2 months to save on shipping costs! I strongly recommend this product.",dogs,3
"I have two cats, a boy and a girl about five years old. I've been using clumping litter since I first got them as kittens. I've had cats before, but they were always girl cats and I'm finding that the male leaves things a bit stinkier. I do scoop every day, but there was still a definite odor around the litter box. I tried this brand because it was one of the less expensive automatic scoopers and the reviews seemed good. I absolutely love this product! I keep two litter boxes for the cats. I started by placing the scoopfree box next to one of the litter boxes, and stopped cleaning that one. Within a week, both cats had stopped using that box as well as the other one, which is kept on a different floor of my house. They clearly preferred the scoopfree box. If you have timid cats, the noise might be too much and scare them away, but mine are fairly adventurous and will sit in front of the box and watch it scoop. Bonus entertainment value! I have since replaced the second litter box as well.ConsWith two cats, each cartridge lasts about 15-20 days in each box, which is not quite as long as promised.It is very noisy.It costs more for the litter cartridgesProsSmell is goneI don't have to scoop!Less dustMy cats seem to track this litter less than the clay litterBe sure to get the ultra version. I did not know that there were two, and the first one I purchased was just the regular version. I had to purchase a hood separately. The ultra version comes with a hood, and also has a counter for the number of uses, and lets you change timing between use and scoop. The regular version doesn't do that, and I'm kind of annoyed that I didn't know that before purchase.",cats,2
"My complaint about this product is that it shorts out if anything is set on it. The whole point was that my dog steals food off the counter. I wanted to be able to set food on the scat mat so he would be shocked if he went for it. But you can't do that. However, my cats won't go near the counter now that they have been shocked once on low setting. So very effective for them. Wish it came with a plug in as part of the price (which I consider pretty darn high).",dogs,3

"Our female mastiff is 9 months old and about 90 pounds, and we bought this crate for her. It is a very nice crate -- easy to set up, no flaws in the paint or construction, easy slide out tray, and two doors (1 on the end and 1 on the side). The crate is difficult to get out of the shipping box, but I guess that is to be expected. The only reason that I rated this at 4 stars instead of 5 is because the top door latch on the side does not line up and lock without a bit of lifting and wiggling. However, it latches fine once lined up. A couple of notes for those interested:* If you have a large breed dog (mastiff, great dane, etc.) that exceeds/will exceed 90-100 pounds, go with the 48"" crate instead of the 42"". Our dog barely has enough room, and we WILL have to upgrade in just a matter of months.* If you are purchasing the Midwest Heritage table top [ASIN:B002NC7NGW Midwest Classic Collection Heritage Series Hardwood Pet Enclosure for 42-Inch Wire Crates]] to go with this crate, please note the fact that the 48"" table top fits the 42"" crate. I know that most people realize this already, but it is an easy oversight.Overall, great crate! Would highly recommend.",dogs,3

"I was enthralled with the litter robot when I first got it, but it is not without its problems. I am on my second one, and I am getting rid of it, going back to the regular scooping method. The basic design of the Litter Robot is genius, but I think they should develop the Litter Robot 2, or the ""Litter Android"" or something.Firstly, if you have cats, you know that when they scratch around their litter box, some litter gets spilled on the floor. With the litter robot, you don't have to worry about this, because it automatically spills litter all over the floor so your cats don't have to worry about doing it. Every time it rotates, a small amount of litter gets spilled out of the opening. If you don't clean this up everyday, it adds up, leading your cat to believe that it can go on the floor.Also, it doesn't get stuck often but when it does, the lights start blinking, and there doesn't seem to be anything you can do to get it going again. You have to lift the globe up, clean poo and litter out of the gears, and then hope it works. Sometimes it gets stuck when it is half way done rotating, and then it will sit there blinking until you fix it. If this happens while you are getting ready to go to work, its no small task to get it going again, and then you go to work smelling like litter. If your cat gets to it before you have a chance to fix it, he or she is going to go on the floor. If you are buying this so you can handle poo less, this is decidedly inconvenient. You need to have access to a hose to really clean this thing out. Unless you want to get in the tub with it and use the shower head, which sounds pretty gross to me.The biggest problem, and the main reason I am getting rid of mine is that my one of my cats is too big for the litter robot. He can't get in it and turn around inside it, so he sticks his rear end out of the opening and sometimes drops his poo on the little platform, or on the floor next to the box.If the people at Litter Robot are reading, you need to do the following to improve your product. Lengthen the opening into a short tunnel, so that the litter won't spill out all over the floor every time it rotates. Also, the globe itself needs to be a big bigger. Also my first litter robot failed in the following way",cats,2

"I was given an older model LitterMaid litter box and I was hooked. It finally died after about 6 months of use. I decided to order the larger one and I am so happy with this model. It makes it so much easier to manage a cat's pan and it uses less litter compared to convential pans. I check it once in the morning and once in the evening and have to change the waste container about once a week. It is so much more convenient to deal with compared to convential pans. I will never use a convential pan again and if this lasts at least 2 years, I will gladly purchase another one when this one finally wears out. I would definitely recommend this pan to any cat owner.",cats,2
My cat wasn't completely infected with worms but we did see a few of them one day. I ordered this and only gave her half a pill as directed. The worms were gone within a week!

"First of all, let me say that I've bought my last package of Tidy Cats after being a customer for over 30 years. You know a litter is useless when it can stink up a 1,500 sq. ft. basement with great ease. This litter has been changed by the company, Purina, to the point that renders it useless. Hubby just took back two 37 pound pails of this stuff after we went down to our basement and about keeled over from the smell. I threw out the rest of the litter, dumped it from the boxes (yes, Persians require TWO boxes per cat to do their business!) and refilled them with Arm & Hammer. The A&H is amazing - no odor whatsoever! LOVE that stuff! Plus, the Tidy Cats was jamming the automatic litter box, coating the edges, leaving me with a hugely disgusting mess to clean, DAILY. It's thicker, not as finely ground as before, with NO odor control. This 24/7 one was the one I just pitched. You know, it's pretty bad when the cat comes upstairs and paws your leg to get you to change the box he only used once. Come on, Purina, what are you doing? Buy the Arm & Hammer, you'll thank me daily for that decision!",cats,2
"It is hard to find sterilized bones in this length. My dogs love them and they are not harsh on their stomachs like rawhide.

"We got this crate for our 2 French Bulldog puppies. Oh, my, do we love this crate/pen! It's professional quality durable plastic, easy as 1-2-3 to fold and put them in your car, very portable and sturdy enough to handle 2 puppies jumping and leaning against the panel when they are excited! And don't forget this one, so easy to CLEAN too! Look no more if you need a dog crate/pen for small dogs or puppies. It's open on the top so that puppies don't feel like they are trapped in a cage. Our children go in and out of the crate to greet and play with the puppies. Even I can do it too! We take this crate everywhere we go. The assembly takes only 10 seconds to put it up! And it's portable size that you can put in the trunk and go! I even flew jet blue with our puppies and the crate.

The only problem is that we keep them in the refrigerator and every time we open the door the mom cat comes running hoping for one and the kittens soon follow if they are awake.",cats,2
I bought three bottles of Thyro-Pet on a 3 for 2 price deal. I used 2 bottles giving the highest dosage. Had my dog tested and the results came back as low as when he was first diagnosed and before he was on any medication. Obviously the stuff didn't work at all. I sent the test results and TWO bottles back to the company. They only gave me a refund for ONE bottle. They refuse to refund the second bottle claiming I got that one for free. I fulfilled their return requirements but they still won't give me the rest of my money back.

"I have yet to encouter a dog that doesn't enjoy Dingos. From the youngest puppy to the oldest senior, they all have loved the various Dingo bones and treat.The biggest challenge is buying a size big enough to prevent the dog from eating it rather than chewing it. This is not true of all dogs, but if the dog has food or treat issues it can be a consideration. They really lovethese treats and seem to not want to be patient or risk not getting the entire bone. And most of the dogs I have given these to also tend to want to chew them from start to finish, so I do have to take the treat away from a dog occasionally.There are Dingo imitators out there that cost less, but I have yet to find one that is of similar quality. I have tried a couple and will continue to sample others, but so far there is not a generic Dingo equivalent.",dogs,3
"I have to confess I ordered this to fill up an order to get free shipping. This is the best cat toy I have ever bought and believe me, I have spent much on more expensive items. I have two cats, One a youngster of three and one a more mature cat of nine. The youngest cat has claws and destroys most of her toys soon after she gets them. Not this toy....very well made and has survived without losing a feather so far. The feathers are very heavy duty and I just can't believe it cost so little. Both cats love the toy. The youngest likes it when I make it""fly"". The construction is such that it wiggles and moves just like a real bird when you whip it through the air. She goes into hunting mode and when I finally let her catch it she flattens her ears back and takes it in her mouth and takes off with it with me running behind. Very funny site. The older cat likes it when I drag it on the ground and she chasses it so I alternate flying and dragging it all through the house and we all get our exercisae.

"We have three cats, but one who is 16 and for some odd reason, just stopped going to the box. It has been a TRIAL. I've had to throw out floor rugs that were 'impacted', with both #1 & #2. We took her to the vet, who said she had gotten a bacterial infection and meds helped solidify things, but she still refused to use the box. Seriously, I was considering it time to send her off to kitty heaven. I read an article about the low front Lucky Champ box and ordered it to see if it was just her having trouble getting into the box. We named it the Titanic when it arrived, it is so large, and we were sure that our 11 lb cat would at least have a shot at getting in to give it a go. No go. I decided to try this litter which says on the label Guaranteed. I took the box out, washed it and removed the old litter and added the Precious Cat litter. She went into the box the same day. Since we have three litter boxes, and the other two cats were of course, attracted to the same 'new' litter, I tossed the old boxes and bought two new boxes at the local dollar store, while I waited for two larger boxes on backorder to arrive. Add the same Precious Cat litter. Bam! The problem cat will go into ANY of the 3 boxes to go; she didn't need a fancy box, just a litter that she likes! To me, worth every dime. Wish I had known about it earlier as I lost about $800 in rugs. I also found that I can buy it from Wag.com direct; $49.00 and the shipping goes Free, which if you buy it here, it still comes from them, but there is the shipping charge.

Her coat is much softer and she seems more alert and energetic - great signs for a short time with the product.Also I had ordered 2 of the product by mistake and the return was easy and the seller quickly gave me a refund.Years ago I used Missing Link for dogs with an abused dog I rescued. She had patchy fur and was just a wreck. Well after giving her the supplement not long after to my horror almost all of her fur fell out. I kept the faith and sure enough it grew back and she developed a beautiful fluffy coat. She regained her well-being and I was able to place her with a forever family :)So I have long been a fan of Missing Link - for some reason I never tried it with my cat and wish i would have been supplementing her diet with this product all along. With a small animal this is a great value and will last a long time - keep refrigerated if possible and remember to go slow to get them used to the extra fiber.,cats,2
"I purchased this with alot of apprehension after reading all the negative reviews, but I just couldn't help myself. I really hate cleaning the litter box THAT much. I followed the instructions carefully, using only a little bit of litter, which is where I assume most of the bad reviewers went wrong. I have two very large cats, that really...take care of business in the litter box, so my Littermaid has really been put thru the ultimate test over the last few months of having it. Occasionally, if one of the cats goes directly on the rake, it clumps onto it, but it comes with a tool that easily dislodges it. I empty the recepticle about once a week, reusing the same tray a few times to save money on refills. So all-in-all this was a great purchase, I dont mind occasionally tending to the litterbox when there are clogs, its well worth the exchange of not having to scoop litter every day. Also the ionic filter works wonders, there is almost zero odor!I dont know what the other reviewers were doing wrong or perhaps they just has insanely high expectations..come on people, this is a litterbox.",cats,2

"Hesitantly got this for my 40 pound lab mix (medium sized toy) and he loves it. He isn't very food driven and doesn't care for most treats so I didn't expect him to give it the time of day. Once he figured out what it was he spends HOURS with it. Took him about 30 minutes to get the treat out so we put it in the center compartment instead of on the outside. After his first week of chewing there is no damage so it seems to hold up to it's claims. Even though I paid $20 for it from a pet store, still extremely happy with this purchase.",dogs,3

All six pets agreed this thing was fantastic. Even the Maincoons purred and didn't try to run off. The Sheppard/chow wagged her tail didn't try to sit down or walk off.The Sheppard/chow is one of those dogs that has the never ending tuffs of fur coming off her all summer long. One good combing with her and she was good for two weeks. I think it is amazing I have never found a comb like this before.Love it five stars!",cats,2
"My small dog LOVES this toy. She even plays with it when there is no food inside. She figured out how to get the food out rather quickly, but I think it is still fun for her to roll it around and nibble every once in a while. She is also a tad bit heavy and has lots of energy, so I think this is a great way to get her to eat. I found it to be better than the wobble food dispenser because it requires a bit more energy to get the food out, which allows her to spend more time running around.",dogs,3
"This appears to be EXACTLY the same box as the Petmate Giant Litter Pan sold on Amazon as the dimensions are the same (except rounded up)and this one is more money. There are hundreds of reviews for the Petmate Giant Litter Pan -some of them by dog owners. below is my Petmate Giant Litter Pan review page.Although I KNEW from reading the reviews this litter box is big. One box side has a slight curve which makes it appear not so wide and when actually on the ground it doesn't seem so big either. My 4 cats, 2 of which like to dig, love it. One of the side pockets holds a huge litter box scoop and the other side holds a 4lb open box of baking soda and a small plastic spray bottle which I filled with Fabreeze.The cat box smell is GONE!The cat litter bed is so large that a lot can be put into it before it smells. Because it is so big, it is easier to scoop. It uses 1 and 1/2 boxes of Wal-Mart's Special Kitty Scoopable cat litter (EXACTLY same as Scoopaway but cheaper). And, I scoop and dump into an empty Scoopaway plastic container lined with a plastic grocery bag. When the top is on that Scoopaway box, zero scent escapes. When box is full, remove plastic bag, tie off and dump in outside trash can. Spray the Fabreeze located on the side litter box pocket into the Scoopaway box BEFORE putting in the plastic garbage bag/lid back on and viola - no more smells. I even pour the extra Wal-Mart Special Kitty scoopable cat litter which comes in a cardboard container into an empty Tidy Cat for Multiply cats plastic box (love the orange lid - but litter too tracky/grainy) plastic container and then stack the scoopaway plastic poop box on top of it.

"I'm a skeptic. I've researched way too much about the available food for dogs out there. In my search for something to feed my dogs, I had to balance my desire to not feed them the corn-laden garbage (which they cannot digest) sold in most supermarkets, against the $80+ per bag the premium foods cost. I even considered going to BARF (biologically appropriate raw food) but it's just too much work for me.This is excellent dog food at an excellent price.

Draw string bags are in my eyes for carbon or any other heavier media. I now only buy this product in the manufactured Pre-measured micro mesh bag in 100ml. These bags are ""welded"" which is amazing. So nothing gets throught these bags. I use two in my 100gal. I love that you can regenerate the Purigen beads. You can only regenerate them a handful of times (I've regenerated them 3 times so far) but you will get your moneys worth. I buy about 4 bags of the 100ml to not have any downtime for filtration.

"I've wondered why people always give negative reviews for pin brushes that have round pin heads on it insead of straight pins. I can understand for show dogs or if you definitely don't want to cause any hair loss from brushing, then you need a straight pin brush such as a Chris Christensen. I have a CC brush, and oh man it really runs smoothly. But I haven't used it for a long time. Because for me, I DO want to lift and brush out as much as loose hair as I can.If you use any undercoat rakes, Furminator, universal slicker brush, Mars Coat King or alike, chances are you want to get rid of those loose undercoat hair that can get tangled up or spread around your place. If that's the case, you would want to use a brush with rounded pin heads like this one. It'd lift and catch more loose hair than a straight pin brush but cause less skin irritation because of the rounded pin heads. By the way, trust me that you don't want to use those undercoat rakes, Furminator, slicker brush or Mars coat king. They will either hurt your dog or pull/cut some top coat definitely more than a pin brush. You just need to simply brush out all the loose hair before they get tangled up.I found this Millers Forge Pin Brush meets my purpose as stated above. My dog has white undercoat and black top coat. Everytime after I brush I can see white hair on the brush but no black hair, so I know I am brushing out those loose undercoat hair. I only hope the pin area can be a bit bigger for large dogs. It is light and comfortable to hold though. I don't have the brush in front of me now, but I'd say the pin is about 3/4inch long. Many pin brushes I used before the pins will start to sack into the rubber base after about a year of use. I don't know how long this one will last.",dogs,3

"I have owned this filter for 3 months now,installed on a 75 gallon fresh-water tank set up for discus. Water quality,and clarity is perfect,(I do regular partial water changes as recommended as well). I do use ""chemi-pure Elite"" instead of carbon, for chemical filtration. The filter itself does demand that you assemble it carefully. Flow is excellent. It is absolutely silent, had to pull up the tube to see if it was even running-it was shooting out ! I have had cannister filters clear back to the original Hills-Kordon 3 stage filter 20+ years ago. It was good but not big enough. This one is great. Not for a casual hobbyist really though. If you just want to hang a filter on the back, install some filter media and go-get an external power filter. I do see how if not assembled carefully, this could leak, or if a hose came off. However, this is a fairly serious piece of equipment and does what it is advertised to do. Discus are completely unforgiving, mine are healthy and happy, with this and multiple power head undergravel filtration to augment it. I am putting one on my ""altum"" wild angel tank next. I would not hesitate to use it on a marine tank either.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I ordered a small for my yorkie. He weighs about 8 pounds. Love the coat for him, but wish I would have bought the size extra small - look at the sizing chart that is under the ""Product Details,"" would have saved me buying a bit too big (I'm not docking the star rating, as I should have done more research on the sizing). The small is for dogs 10-12 inches from the back of the neck to their bum. So, the coat on his back is perfect for him, but the straps that go under his belly cover up parts that need to be exposed :-). But I just stitched the straps a little, so they sit closer to his front legs, and it is going to work for my dog.

"1st off I want to say that I'll be surprised if my feedback isn't altered like two of my other honest feedbacks have been. #1 the description is misleading (shows SX1 when it's indeed an SX3 which is important to note because the Forever rake won't work in the updated SX3 or SX4 models.) #2 it was in poor condition with marks on it when it arrived and appeared either refurbished or like it had been sitting in a warehouse for many years. I'm giving it 3 stars simply based on the poor purchase from Amazon combined with the fact that I happen to own 2 of these and love them. They were both purchased elsewhere. I purchased the 2nd one from the same original place as my 1st one after I returned this one to amazon. So, I would say buy the item but, not from Amazon. I've purchased many things through the years from Amazon that I've been happy with (including the 6pk refills for this litter box). And this is the only item I've rated this way after having this experience. So, yours could be of better appearance when it arrives and may have been a single incident for me? Doesn't change the fact that the description is incorrect. So if you're purchasing a forever rake (like I did) don't waste your time because you'll have to turn around and send the rake back (to a seperate company) at your own expense. On an added note, the optional forever tray is great as well as the owner of the company who makes it. Great guy! And you can purchase the Tidy cat crystal litter for it locally. I pay $13 for an 8lb bag at Target & Walmart (even less when I have a coupon). 1 bag fills both of my trays at the time of each cleaning.",cats,2

"For the past few years I have been on a quest to find a litter box that doesn't drive me totally bonkers. Well, for me, this is the one.At first I was apprehensive because I have four cats total, and two of them are afraid of their own shadows. I wasn't sure if all of them would take to this foreign contraption. Well, two of them could hardly wait until I finished pouring the litter to give it a try. And the other two weren't far behind. So that answered that question.As for me, I have far less to clean up, which is what I have been looking for. Sure a few grains get stuck in their paws and end up near the box. But I can't even begin to express what a profound improvement that is from other brand X cat boxes. I no longer have to worry about my vacuum blowing up from all the litter intake.I like that I can pour extra litter into the box to make the scooping less toilsome. And since my cats love to throw litter everywhere, the lid and high sides allow for that without permitting them to create their own beach out of my laundry room floor.Five stars! And I'm going to buy one of these for everyone I know who owns cats!",cats,2
"Perhaps if your cat always pees in the center of the litter box, then this unit works exactly as advertised. Mine is not such a case.With male cats whizzing in corners and creating adhesive wall-litter clumps, simply rolling the unit over will not earn you a clean litter box. Another issue is that the pull-out tray does not reach all the way to the back of the box, so anything in that area will often not be trapped.These weaknesses aside, the Omega Paw is still a huge improvement from a traditional litter box.

But the rest of the night, and much of every day, she is on the mat. So we figure it must be warming her. She really seems to like it.The mat does make little crunching noises when she works it over with her paws before settling into it, but the crunching is not loud, couldn't wake anybody, and is actually sort of pleasant to hear, somehow slightly comical.It's less garish than it might appear in the photo, not bad at all.

"With two Alaskan Malamutes, there is no way I could properly exercise them each day without this product. At a slow pace they can practice proper gait for the show ring and at a faster pace they can burn up some of that extra energy. If you have dogs that love (and were bred) to pull like I do, they can pull to their hearts content. Initially I ran them separately but since the springer allows for switching the unit from one side to the other, I bought a second and now run them together. They enjoy being out together and it saves time.Although some pictures show using the unit without a leash, I would advise against that. If you have a big dog you need to be able to control it if a rabbit or other critter runs out of the brush. I use a short leash about 3 foot long on each dog.Also I was not happy with the method of hooking the dogs up. Instead each dog wears a Distance Harness from Howling Dog Mushing Supplies[...]I use a brass double ended bolt snap to hook from the harnesses to the springer.",dogs,3

"We have 2 cats that dig to china in a litter box & make an incredible mess. We tried this hoping it would alleviate the problem but it is so flimsy and the dome fits so poorly on the base that the cats kept knocking the top off & created a bigger problem. This resulted in litter scattered not only on the steps going into the dome, but all around the dome after they knocked the lid off. In particular, we were trying to have less litter dragged into the rest of the house (the litter is in the laundry room); unless I used the shop vac to remove the litter from the steps every day, the cats were actually dragging MORE litter throughout the house. Especially after the amount we had spent on this pan, we were very disappointed. The other problem with this design is that the actual litter area is quite small, which contributed to our one large cat (15+ pounds) knocking the dome off. We will be donating it to a rescue group in the hope that someone can use it. We are quite pleased with our solution",cats,2

"OK, let me explain this. For years I just kept a simple liquid crystal thermometer stuck on the side of my tank with no problems. I got this to help regulate the maintenance and liked that it had an electronic thermometer. One day the alarm started going off and indicating a high temp. So I turned the thermostat down. This kept happening and happening until I was keeping the lid open and turned down the thermostat all the way down just to keep the temp in the right range. Over time my fish started acting strange and my normally healthy tank started to look sickly and even dead. All this time, my old liquid crystal temp was registering 72 degrees, while this thing was reading over 84 degrees. I knew I had turned my thermostat all the way down and that this thing was likely broken and decided to start relying on my old liquid crystal thermometer instead of this thing. It still works ok for monitoring the regular maintenance i.e. weekly water changes, monthly filter changes, etc., just don't trust the temperature because it doesn't work and may potentially kill your fish.",fish aquatic pets,4
"ThisSherpa Pet Trading SHERPA ROLL-UP PET TOTE-LARGEproduct is great. We have a cat that is extremely afraid of everything vet-related. With the older-type carrier, that is hard and opens at the end, it was very difficult to treat her at the vet's",dogs,3

"This ramp would be fine for a really strong person, but a really strong person could just lift the dog up!

Yesterday, I dropped the darn thing on my foot trying to unfold it.",dogs,3
I have ordered these before and was happy with them. They were long and usually curled length wise in sort of like a stick of cinnamon. The dogs enjoyed them with nothing left behind. This time I ordered 3 packages and they were flat shapes and irregular sizes. These shredded into small sharp shard-like pieces that looked decidedly dangerous and the dogs couldn't finish them. If they had tried I think these would have caused harm. At these prices I won't risk it again.,dogs,3

"I bought this item from Amazon to use for my Bichon Frise as a car travel case, While we frequently take him with us, we used the case only a few times to contain him in a safe area. Last evening we brought the Bichon to a small gathering and I put him in the carrier so that I could eat my dinner while he was safe as well as out of the reach of the group. Within 5 minutes I watched as my 7.5 pound dog walked freely among the gathering. He had ripped the screening in one area of the case and ripped out a three cornered piece, gaining his freedom. Fortunately this was a very safe place but I cannot imagine the havoc that could have happened should this have happened anywhere else. It is too late to return the product, all packaging is gone as is the shipping information. The problem has nothing to do with Amazon, I will continue my relationship with them! But I will not purchase anything else from the manufacturer and would advise everyone else to avoid a purchase of this item.",cats,2
"I decided to turn my Biube into a nano reef tank. First, I pretty much gutted everything out including the filter, air pump, and and the tube the bubbles ride in. In order for this to work without the filtration unit, lots of live sand and live rock need to be added. I added 20 lbs of live sand, and 18 pounds of live rock to the biube. I then stuck a powerhead and a small heater behind the live rock in the back ( my tank sits in a corner). Last I purcahsed a Coralife Nano lighting unit with daylight & antinic bulbs. I cut and modified the top a little to get more light in the tank with the new lightning unit. I did not add a protein skimmer, so a 20% water change should be done every two weeks. I Got a good clean-up crew, and it was good to go. I love the way the live rock, and fish look in this tank. I like the biube alot and may purchase another.",fish aquatic pets,4
"My daughter bought this recently from Amazon. I was hesitant, as I had read a review that stated how narrow the walk-thru was. Since this looked to be the best to fit our needs...letting the cat get down the hallway to her food and litter box, without letting the dogs in, she bought this one. Have to tell you, I'm not small, not huge, but definitely a plus size senior citizen. The senior citizen fat cat and I both go through easily. As both the utility room and my bedroom are at the end of the rather long hall, this door sees plenty of action. I was also pleasantly surprised by how nice the gate looked when installed. Huge improvement over the wood and mesh expansion baby gate, that I had cut a hole in to let the cat through, and had to move every time I wanted to go down the hall. Both of our dogs are mid-sized, in the 50-60 lb. range, and neither has shown any desire to attempt that little cat door. I really love this gate, and so does the cat!!Just one word of advice. Someone earlier also recommended that you not cut the fastener holding the doorway closed, until after installation. If there are two of you doing this, absolutely, leave it secure until you're finished. If you are installing alone, like I was, I found it very convenient to be able to use the opened door to prop the gate up while I was playing with the adjusting rods. That may just be me, but I thought I would share that with you. I also found the instructions to be clear, and the gate was very easy to install.",dogs,3

"I have had the Nutrafin system for a few months now. I used the included Activator/Stabilizer packets for the first 3 months,then switched to molasses based sugar and yeast.Some observations:The ladder style CO2 diffuser really works well. Evidence ofthis is the size of the CO2 bubble that is introduced intothe diffuser at the bottom compared to the size of the bubblethat comes out at the top. The bubble becomes an order ofmagnitude smaller as it traverses the diffuser- which is anotherway of saying that CO2 is getting dissolved in the water. Whenit is first introduced to a new aquarium, this observation alone could verify that it is working.For anyone expecting quick results, it took about 15 days beforemy plants showed ""pearling"" and about another week (around 21-22days) before I saw the promised lush green plant growth. (Notethat I have 2.5 watts per gallon of light for 10 hours a day anduse Seachem Flourish once a week.)There is no easy way to turn off CO2 diffusion with the system.Once the lights turn off and unless the water is sufficiently buffered, pH can be dramatically and dangerously reduced. Startwith buffered, neutral water and after 3 weeks it may have turnedslightly acidic- which is an ideal environment for many aquaticplants.",fish aquatic pets,4

"The cat scratch post shown in the illustration is a tasteful beige. Although the listing in Amazon said the item came in various colors, we were surprised when ours turned out to be a sort of brown flophouse tweed. It was also not round, as it appeared, but flat.

"We inherited an Akita that was house kept, so we wanted to do the same for him. The groomer charged $45.00 per visit for a trim/bath he needed monthly, and she earned every dime of the money she charged. To keep the dog I had to do something to ease the financial part of his upkeep. These trimmers were everything the ad said they would be. They stayed cool and sharp, and they were quiet the entire time. The number10 blade cut great. I'm glad I took a chance, and the Oster recommended by my vet was a perfect choice.",cats,2
"We had a dog that was climbing over the fence and running away several times a day. I was afraid to spend the money on an inground system for fear nothing would stop this dog.

It was fairly easy to set up and the training was not bad at all. Highly recommend, especially since this costs a couple of hundred verses thousands that an inground system can run.",dogs,3

While I did see some hair come out while using the FURminator, it didn't seem to be that much more than the slicker brush I ussually use on my dog, let alone the MOUNDS of fur that I was expecting to pull out.Don't fall for the hype around this one -- it's not worth the price tag.",cats,2
"I purchased the Bergan Turbo Scratcher after reading the reviews on Amazon. I looked around at my local pet stores for this item first but then realized, they were charging twice as much as Amazon! I never have a hard time finding $25 to qualify for the free shipping offer. My 13 week old kitten just couldn't get enough of it when we first got it out of the package! Now today, a few days later....it is not getting as much usage as I would like to see. I'm hoping she'll continue to play with it now and then. The scratcher is small enough to just slide under my couch when not in use. This product seems very durable and I can see it lasting for many years. It is also nice that the cardboard scratching area can be replaced overtime if it gets worn out. This product also came with a pouch of catnip that you can sprinkle into the cardboard scratching area that helps draw your cats to the toy. Overall, I recommend this product! Your kitten will love it and you will enjoy watching them play with it too!",cats,2
"My husband and I decided to evict our cats' litter box from the laundry room to the screened in back porch. Of course, we didn't want to have something out there that screamed, ""I'm a litter box!"" so I looked for something that was incognito. I'd seen the exact same box in a catalog for more than twice as much, and once again Amazon came through! I received the box in about three days, and it looks great. Even the plant isn't as cheesy in person as I'd envisioned. The overall quality is very good, and is plenty large enough for my three-cat household. I'm 100% satisfied with this purchase.",cats,2
Merial Frontline Top Spot Flea and Tick Control for Dogs is the only flea and tick product we have used over almost 20 years and half a dozen dogs. It has none of the ivermectin related potential hazards of Heartgard. We use no other flea products in the house or yard and have never found a flea on any of our dogs. They will occasionally pick up a tick when they romp in the forest but they don't attach.Merial Frontline Top Spot Flea and Tick Control for Dogs is also effective against several common canine worms.,dogs,3

This is gentle but effective. Also, really good quality.",dogs,3

Our Boston Terriers tends to back out of collars so a martingale collar is a necessity. The second loop for tags makes this a real winner. The first one I bought the the earth collar for our 2 year old Boston and quickly followed it with the Peace collar for our 1 year old puppy. These collars are well made and definitely not the run of the mill ones found in our local pet store yet the price is less. Easy to recommend to others.,dogs,3

"I haven't even had this for a week, and I'm already impressed with how much easier it makes things. I have a somewhat skittish rescue dog who has a deep love of hiking and water, and who especially tends to romp around in the areas most likely to result in fleas. Tweezing or hand-removing ticks from her was kind of an exercise in zenlike patience, since she doesn't like being held still to get precise enough to remove the ticks safely.With this simple piece of plastic, I can be distracting her with affection while I simply find my target by touch. A quick slide and twist, and the ticks have come off quite easily (and mostly alive, which is a good sign their heads are still attached).So maybe this thing seems overpriced to be a small piece of plastic--and going strictly by materials costs, it definitely is--but it's worth every penny and more in the convenience it brings.",dogs,3
"I expected more from this product. We tried this natural spray at Kaymart that worked even worse. Maybe the Frontline needs several months to work, but based on the results we had with the first application, we are unsatisfied. Our vet told us this was the only product that would absolutely get rid of fleas, but it did not work. About a week after we applied it to our dog, we noticed that she still had fleas. It says that it will continue to work for up to three months, but it did not for us. I will try it once more after a month has past but so far, not working too well.",dogs,3

After reading all the rave reviews about this product I was hopeful that it was as good as it's reviews. The sifting mechanism takes up about 1/3 of the box. The latches are cheap and difficult to lock and unlock. I tried several different brands of litter and found that they all stuck to the bottom of the box requiring me to take it apart frequently. Litter spills out od the cracks as well. I eventually removed the sifting screen as it kept popping out and didn't function as stated anyway. I gave it 2 stars only because it's so large with the divider removed it's a better fit for a very large breed cat like my Siberian Forest cat. It's an interesting idea but it just doesn't work.,cats,2

I have been using Frontline Plus on my dogs for the last 9 years. But when I purchased this box of Frontline Plus it did not control any fleas at all. My doggies are covered in fleas and they are scratching and licking themselves raw! It is so bad they are having to wear e-collars. I really don't know which product to use now since Frontline Plus is the LEAST TOXIC of all the flea medications on the market today. I called Frontline and asked if they had changed their formula but the customer service rep said they hadn't. I told her I thought I had received a bad box because it had always worked in the past. She didn't seem to care! So I returned the unused tubes. I will not longer recommend or purchase Frontline plus ever again!,dogs,3

"Bettas can live in small tanks without filtration and without aeration. However, without filtration their water MUST be changed regularly--not topped off as it evaporates, as evaporation doesn't remove fish waste or nitrates from the existing water. With a one gallon container (the approximate size of this bowl), owners can expect to replace the water once or twice a week, which is no big deal with a tabletop bowl but probably a bit inconvenient with a wall-mounted bowl.Goldfish, on the other hand, need large amounts of water with filtration and aeration. First, they are large fish--they grow up to a foot in length--and thus need a larger quantity of water to maintain them. Second, they are inefficient eaters and produce a lot of waste, and so filtration (and enough water to accomodate their waste) is a must. Third, they are cold water fish, and cold water holds more oxygen; no room-temperature bowl can provide enough. A single gallon will not keep a goldfish alive long, and will not keep it healthy.As for other ""easy-to-maintain"" fish, I have my doubts. A fish may be hardy enough to survive a while in a tiny unfiltered tank, but hardy and healthy are not the same things. In addition, most of these fish will need at least one gallon PER fish, which puts schooling species at a distinct disadvantage.Which brings me to the reviewer who keeps a betta and two African Dwarf Frogs in this bowl and only changes water once every two weeks. Despite the fish lasting 'a whole year' so far, the tank really is overcrowded and under-maintained. The proof is not that the fish and frogs have lasted a year, but whether they last their full lifespan--seven years for the betta, between ten and twenty years for the frogs.",fish aquatic pets,4

"With the arrival of a new Catahoula Leopard dog puppy last December, I knew my carpeting was in trouble. Being a dog lover/rescuer, I had about 15 other pet stain removal products in my arsenal of dog supplies. Since none of them got all of the stain out, I figured what the heck - lets try one more. Boy am I glad I did! This one actually works!!!. Just spray a little on the spot, scrub it in (I use a battery operated scrubber), and dab it up with paper towels. It has gotten up the entire stain, 95% of the time on the first try and does not discolor the carpeting. It even cleaned up stains left-over from other products. And it does equally as well on vomit, pee, and poop. Highly recommend this product. (And, in an emergency, Get Serious is also available at PetSmart.)",dogs,3

"This is the first time I have written a review for a product on Amazon, but I just had to this time. We have a wonderful dog we adopted two years ago, but he started barking a few months ago, and it was driving us crazy. Any noise in our yard, the doorbell or knock on the door would send him into a barking jag. He would usually stop when we yelled at him, but it was all the time. When I put the collar on him I was worried that it would bug him, but it didn't seem to bother him in the least. The first time he went out to bark at something in the yard he got out one bark and that was it, quiet. I thought maybe this would change, but no, the barking has all but stopped. This product worked incredibly well for us, and I can't thank Petsafe enough.",dogs,3
"I have had this fountain for a little over six months now, and finally decided to write a review. While it took some time for my cats to get used to the fountain, they now love it. I typically keep it on the lowest setting - mainly because the reservoir runs out too quickly if it is on the highest setting. I only gave it four stars, because it is somewhat cumbersome to clean. But, it is worth my sanity of not having to turn the bathroom sink on for my two cats that like running water. :) Great product!",cats,2

I can't say the same happens with the other two namebrand cat fountains that I have.There was no plastic smell except for a rather strong one in the soft plastic tube that runs from the pump to the connection on the bowl. But it didn't seem to alter the water any. But I don't have the nose of a cat.UPDATE 01/05/2009It's two years later and my Drinkwell pump died. To tide over my cat (who desperately misses his Drinkwell) until the replacement pump arrives, I pulled this out of the closet. It's been nearly 2 weeks and guess what? He still finds this entertaining and will sit an stare at it every so often, but has yet to take a drink. He even goes over an smells around it, and seems to want to take a drink sometimes, but doesn't.My guess is that he finds the bubbles/rush of air disturbing?",cats,2

"These were cheaper pads, and that being said, you get what you pay for. They come folded up in a quarter of their actual size. On half of them when I went to unfold (no matter how gently and slow I did it) the plastic backing ripped. This, of course, defeated the purpose of the pad because my dog's urine ended up getting on the floor. The ones that actually didn't rip when I unfolded them worked fine. They're pretty absorbent and they are pretty much odor free like the packaging suggests. That said, I won't be buying these again as I don't like the fact that half of them ripped.",dogs,3

"My 14-year old dog has arthritis in his hips, and despite rubber-backed rugs nearly everywhere, he has been slipping on my floors while I'm not home or asleep. Laying on the hardwood floor for hours until I find him wasn't working well :( I wanted to find something safe but softer, lightweight and more roomy than a metal crate. This playpen is perfect! It's small enough for him to feel cozy and secure, sleeping with his back against the ""wall."" He's 70 lbs. and the 36"" x 36"" square is about 1.5 times the size of his orthopedic bed, but not so much extra room that he flails around.The steel frame is fairly heavy and substantial, so when he misses the base area while lying down (he was always missing the bed surface because of stiffness) he just falls against the soft walls on the way down ;) The removable cover allows me to bend into the pen to help lift him up, or clean him up if he can't get up to potty, which -- if you have an ill or senior dog -- you know is amazingly helpful. So is the waterproof liner on the bottom, held in place with velcro. I thought it came with a pad, too, but I'm just going to cut pieces of foam to fit, and drape with washable covers.I found it a little difficult to open on my own, sort of like trying to hold both ends of the wrapping paper tight as you reach for the tape :) but I just ditched the instructions and held the bottom bars down with my foot as I pulled up and locked the top rails.

"I buy a premium dog food for my sheltie, and I wanted the best container available to keep it safe from ants. I think I've found it! No bugs (or mice!) to be seen, I don't think they even know there's dog food in there.I *was* having a problem opening the Vittles Vault; I'd try to unscrew the lid, but the container would slide on the floor in the direction I was turning, so I'd have to try to brace the container with my feet while turning the lid.... it was kind of a hassle. Turns out I was overtightening the lid when closing the Vittles Vault. The manufacturer says to just spin the lid, and when it stops, it's closed. Oh. Well. Boy, is my face red. Now it's much easier for me to open the lid, and it still keeps out ants.The 1 1/4 cup measurement scoop that's included is the perfect size for a daily ration for my 30 lb sheltie. I feed her a small-sized kibble (Canidae All Life Stages), and this container fits the 40 lb bag with a little room left over. I can't imagine that it'd hold 50 lbs of my kibble, but since my kibble comes in 40 lb bags, it works great for me.I love it, and so does my sister, who bought one to store her cat food in.",dogs,3

It is easy to clean and the extra reservoir help ensure that the motor does not burn out from being dry. I hope this eliminates her getting bladder infections from not drinking enough water (much more expensive than the water bowl!)",birds,0
"These balls are Jack Russell proof, and I got seven of them!!I've bought a package of 10 tennis balls every other month for years, so my Jack Russells would get their much needed exercise. Since I've bought two packages of these, I've only used the first two, and they are still in use, and the dogs love them better because they bounce higher!!I highly reccommend these!!",dogs,3
We have have been using frontline Hot Spot on our two big dogs (over 85 pounds each ) ever since our Vet recommended it. We do not use Frontline Plus because we are suing Heartgard for heartworm protection and we worm our dogs annually. I think this is one of the best flea preventers out there.,dogs,3
"Wow this is so great. I was surprised at the price, I sure would like to get it cheaper but it sure works. Thank you",dogs,3

We found out about this product from a friend. We tried it and it has definetly improved our dogs shedding. We will continue to buy this product.,dogs,3
"The cover rotates, not the dish - so the unit needs to be placed so your dog can reach it from all sides. This doesn't work in my kitchen, I feed my dog at the end. It is also somewhat small. I have a small yorkie who eats 1/4 cup of small kibble. This unit would work for that quantify, if you have a bigger dog I don't think it would work. I'm returning it. It seems sturdy, so if the design works for you I would highly recommend it.",cats,2
"Our cat loves this stuff. It seems extremely potent and is the best quality cat nip I've ever encountered. Just a tiny pinch and she has a strong reaction. (Some cats don't respond to cat nip, but she does.)I'd highly recommend this catnip. Its powerful, fresh, and cat approved.",cats,2

"I order this thinking I would get a small bunny, I ended up getting a large one. The cage ended up being to small, my fault for ordering it without thinking. It was easy to set up, and I liked the idea of the wheels so that It could be easly moved around for cleaning. I wasnt thrilled about the slide under drip pan. I was told by the person selling me my rabbits that rabbits need to eat the fesies to help digestion. This cage was not good for that. But all and all a good cage.",bunny rabbit central,1

My 18-year old maltese-poodle mix has been taking NaturVet Glucosamine DS Time Release with MSM and Chondroitin since she was 14 1/2 years old. It has helped keep her active and comfortable. She gets it before she goes to bed at night and she thinks she is getting a treat instead of medicine. I would recommend this product for any dog starting to show signs of arthritis.,dogs,3
"I have three cats, 2 of my cats really enjoy playing with it, especially the boy. he just loves biting and chewing and rolling around with it!",cats,2
"I have a 130lb female great dane. I figured a cage with a great dane pictured on the packaging would be suitable for a great dane, seems logical, right?I locked my dane in here and left the room. she escaped in moments. All that needs to be done to escape is to press with enough force to pop open the front. I went in myself and could easily escape by simply pressing the gate with enough force.The latches are not long enough to stand the force of a dane pushing the door. The next try she grabbed it with her teeth and pulled the front gate, this caused the entire front to come loose from the rest of the crate. Because the front came loose there were sharp edges that cut her nose.I would not buy this again, and DO NOT recommend. I have remedied my crate by attaching all pieces with zip ties, and need two padlocks to keep my dog in without injuring herself trying to escape.",dogs,3

"I managed to break the swinging door off during the training period with our fickle (scaredee) cat (taping it open). Although it was probably due more to my own clumsiness than anything else, this vendor sent me an entirely new unit on their own initiative! THAT is customer service to the max and I would definitely purchase from them again. Wish our car dealers (had three of them at one time) could take a page from this company's standard practice policies.Thank you!",cats,2
"This bad boy works pretty slick. I have two cats, so I needed something a little bigger. I just roll the unit over once every night before bed and toss out the clumps.I'm ordering some of those air wick stick ons to put on the inside of the box. The left side of the unit never gets litter on it, so I figured this would be a great place to do a little extra odor control. How cool would it be if the next model had a filter on the side? Pretty darn cool!Buy this thing.",cats,2

"My Sheltie was so in love with this toy that when we would take it away from him, he remembered exactly where we would hide it and he'd try to coax us to give it back! The problem is that despite watching him carefully, he still chewed off a nub and it became garbage. But boy did he ever love it!",dogs,3
The fence transmitter and receiver collar work just as well as the expensive ones that the pet containment companies would like to sell you. But watch out for the light guage antenna wire that comes with this kit. I've had 3 problems with the wire:- Stapling the twisted pairs to the side of my house - the flat staples cut right through the insulation and shorted the antenna loop. Took a while to track that down.- Easy to break. Above ground stretches of the wire (along a fence) have broken twice.- Apparent high impedance - the transmitter chirps intermittently because it thinks there's a break in the wire when there isn't. I suspect this is just the impedance from 1000 feet of tiny wire.I plan to buy a roll of heavier wire at the hardware store and replace the antenna entirely.Follow Up (Dec 2009),dogs,3
"I have been using this product for a few months now. I mix one good squirt with a little salmon for my dog every night at dinner time. His skin is no longer itchy and his fur is nice and silky. Before, when I went to his vet, they only offered steroids or allergy meds. I could not brush him without his leg scratching a mile a minute. I tried other products like supplements, but he refused to eat one brand and the other did nothing. This salmon oil for dogs is perfect for my dog.",dogs,3
"This cat litter box is superior to all others, even the electric kind - which I have tried.Cleaning is just a matter of rolling upside down and then back again and then emptying the cartridge. So simple. The reason why this model is BETTER than my electric models I have owned is that it requires no batteries, my cats aren't afraid of it, it is a private enclosure AND it will NEVER BREAK! my electric one broke after a year and at $100 I feel that the price was just not worth it! This one is a fraction of that price and will never break.The only thing you need to consider is that you will need ample space to ""Roll"" it on it's top and back again. If you buy the large size plan for at least 3 feet.",cats,2
"The Hide A Squirrel (look like chipmunks 2 me) dog toy is THE BEST dog toy that I'v found for Kaya, my Yorkshire Terrier!

"Thank you. I got this for a cat who is dying of cancer and word back is that he is very happy in his last days. So I got a tin for my cats and as soon as it is opened, everyone clusters around me to get a pinch for themselves. Good quality nip that even I can smell.",cats,2

"I have to say first, it was extremely fast shipping. I was told it would be here in a week and it came in only two days.. thankfully. My cats came into contact with another I had staying in the house for a while and I gave them a de-wormer that was supposed to be good. Although it seemed it had gotten rid of them.. I gave it to them as much as it said, but recently they started coming back. So finding a brand that is said to be as good as a Vet, which I couldn't afford to go to, I decided to try it. It's -very- hard to give them this tablet. I ended up crushing it and using a syringe because they would not touch it even ground up into their food. It's been almost a week now and still no sign. I'll give it a higher rating once I know they're gone for good.Edit",cats,2

These two leashes are so we can keep a pair in the car so when we take the dogs someplace don't discover we left their leashes at home. Should one of the original leashes fail we'll have a replacement on hand. Ribbon band (vs 'cord') saves on rope burn on occasion. These are excellent leashes and recommend them. Be aware there are different sizes/types/colors.,dogs,3
Buy them all the time and never have a problem. I get the 150pk as it is more cost efficient. My dog never had a problem with these pads and prefers them over other brands.,dogs,3

"I have owned several brands of canister filters ranging from Rena XPs, Fluval 5 series and then Eheim. My first canister filter is from Fluval and I kinda like it but the fact that I can't see inside the canister, really bothers me. The overall quality of Fluval is also mediocre. Most of the parts are made from plastic. Not any plastic but cheap felt like plastic. Next, I purchase a Rena XP3 filter that has see through canister. It was a lot easier to set up compare to Fluval and I love Rena's siphon/vacuum method but the humming noise is killing me even it is in the cabinet.As we all know Eheim is well known among fish hobbyist so I decided to try one. Since all filters designed differently, I went ahead and took out the how to guides or I assume that what it was. The directions was so poorly, I have hard time understanding it. I went to youtube and found somebody had similar experience and he decided to create a how to set up Eheim filter. You should be able to find out using common sense though but it was 12 o'clock at night and I decided to give my brain a rest so I googled and youtubed.After hooking everything up, all I can say is WOW. Yes, the directions is poorly made but the design and quality is far more superior comapared to my Fluval and Rena. It is sitting 3 feet from me and all I can hear is the output water noise. It also have dual valves which should make changing water a lot easier.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Omg. Quiet Spot has been sooooo helpful. I have a 4 month old boxer puppy and he looooves to run and play. My family kept getting irritated at all the noise his tags made. He has his personal ID tag in the shape of a bone, a city tag in the shape of a firehydrant, and a rabies tag in the shape of a heart. All very different shapes and sizes. It got to the point where I never put his collar on because of all the noise(and complaining). Now he can run and play as hard as he wants and there is no jingling. Even he seems happier to not have jingling going on. Quiet Spot is very handy and extremely flexible. It's even reflective! Quiet Spot is my new best friend!",dogs,3
"First this is not a ""crate"" to contain an animal that does not want to be contained.That said, it is fantastic for cats going to the vet and dogs especially if you trying to contain in a car.We have one for out cat, and when it's not in use it just folds up and goes in the closet. I bought one for our son for their dog, she is a 60 lb mix and it's perfect while she is in the car. Then it folds up and goes in the truck. very handy.",dogs,3

"This item is awesome. We've been using it to keep our kittens off of the kitchen counter when we're away. People have been telling us that you can't train kittens -- they are wrong.First off, the only reason I gave this item 4 stars is that it uses (4x) AAA batteries and does not have a DC plug-in port. The miniscarecrow seems to blow through these in a little over a month of all-day-everyday use.That said, the motion sensor works well and is tuned perfectly (for a cat size object). It's neither too sensitive nor too slow. We set ours up on the counter (out-of-site) pointing across the length of the counter.... no more ""transgressions"".As an additional bonus, this things works *outstanding* on humans too (as a prank to scare them). Come Halloween, I'm going to have some fun!Last bit....the spray is truly non toxic and non-harmful. Having triggerred it myself numerous times (forgot it was on) and take a blast right to the face. The spray doesn't smell or leave residue -- it's only a little bit cold.",cats,2
"It's hard to tell if my dog has benefited much from the oil. She's been on it for about a year, 2x daily. Then again, she's about 11 years old and her coat is beginning to change, less shinny and vibrant. I continue with the oil because I think it's beneficial to have it in her system. It's sort of like the yoga I practice...it's designed to ""maximize potential and minimize liability."" My hope is that the oil does just that.",dogs,3
Product came in a tube with a syringe. Expected the box with six doses. Very unhandy. Not what I thought I was ordering. Bad advertising.,dogs,3
"Both my kitten and my 12 yr old male love this toy, I think it's in part because the feathers ""spin"" when the toy is pulled through the air. It's also awesome that I can just buy replacement feather-toys to attach at the end of the line once this toy breaks. I was a bit worried about them chewing on the metal connectors and damaging their teeth though, so I just taped over the metal parts with electrical tape before letting them play with their new toy.",cats,2

Loose stools...and they only eat it if they are hungry.I understand about the commodities going up. But, I would have rather they raised the prices rather than switch ingredients without warning.Now, I gotta go hunt for another brand that is good for my dogs, and not part of the original recall.It may just be time to buy a cow!",cats,2
"This product got my attention because not only is it environmentally safe, but also can be put on the pets along with their bedding. The only down fall of this product was that it is only half full. I am not exactly sure if the product worked. We got a flea problem after getting a new dog so we bombed some rooms and gave them all baths. This didn't seem to work completely so we got some spray and powder. It looks as though it took effect, but we still get the occassional flea. Though our flea problem was horrible so if you only see a few fleas this should do the trick.",dogs,3
Was just what I expected and works perfectly. Was shipped fast and arrived undamaged. The lights powered right up to light up my aquarium.,fish aquatic pets,4
"We would prefer not having to crate our pup at all but his energy and mischievous nature gave us no options. He does really well. We've tried other kennels. He either chewed them in a short period of time or outgrew them. He loves his new abode. Sturdy, roomy, easy to wipe down...a quality product. If I had one complaint it would be that the tray on the bottom of the cage moves when the pup steps out. It needs to fit a little more snug. It causes our pup to second guess getting in and out. One suggestion would be to sell a cover for it. Blocking out noise and light could be helpful. Overall very pleased.",dogs,3
I have used the treat version for a few years now and think they do a good job. Our dogs (smaller sized) love them.,cats,2
Very handy bag dispenser that you can hook on to your leash when you walk your dog to pick up dog's waste. Works very well. After we used the 30 bags provided we simply fill the container with cheap lunch sandwich bags. We have a chihuahua and don't need the very large blue bags that come with the dispenser.,dogs,3

"I recently got the Furminator and I do have to say, I am amazed at the amount of hair I can scrape off my Lab mix after a couple of minutes, plus it leaves his coat super shiny as an extra perk. My dog doesn't seem to enjoy it at all though. I'm assuming it probably feels odd, as it tugs on his not-yet-detached hairs.The handle grip is sturdy and way improved compared to the last version of this product, and the switch to up-down movement, versus left to right scraping, is much more natural.The lasting issue I have is how often to use it? Once or twice weekly doesn't seem to be enough to make a difference on my floor, so consider that this may need to become a part of your daily routine to get some true value out of it.",cats,2
"First, I have to say that this device looks atrocious. It is straight out of a 60's B-Movie about space exploration. It also looks like they could slap any logo on it and claimed it did anything they wanted to. However, it actually works with our dog. I have used it because he will bark and he doesn't always come when called. Every time he barks, I give the button one tap and he stops immediately - I don't even show him the device. His barking is way down since we got it. Similarly, when he doesn't come, a quick tap on the button and he comes running. I can actually see him reacting so I know the device is working.On the whole this is a much better solution for us that the shock collar. Those worked, but had to be turned on and chewed through batteries. This is cheaper and equally effective.",dogs,3
My dog loved this ball and has had hours of fun playing with it. The size is deceiving as medium is only the size of a tennis ball but perfect for my Staffordshire Terrier. They are hard plastic so make sure you get the right size as a large dog could swallow the small size.,dogs,3
"After hearing about so many cats finding this water fountain irresistable, I bought one in February. My cats like running water from a faucet as much as the next cat, but neither one of them ever seemed to take a drink from this new fountain. I ran it for about 6 weeks, but the reservoir water level didn't go down and I never saw them drinking from it. I finally disconnected it for good and am getting rid of it. It's just a little too large and a little too noisy to keep around for another try.",cats,2

"Takes about a week to work but when it starts, it really brings down ammonia levels to zero. I tested the water and changed about 15% every two days (to keep ammonia levels low) until it kicked in.My only complaint is that the beneficial bacteria builds up really quickly on the bio-max and will block some of the water in the filter from going into the tank. However, that can be easily fixed by using some tank water (dip out some) and placing the bio-max pack in it so some of the bacteria will be removed (Using freshwater will kill all beneficial bacteria on the bio-max)",fish aquatic pets,4
"This is perfect for larger turtles, and I am really glad I got it. I got one locally from the petstore and it had a hole in the top that went to the center so I returned it and was NOT HAPPY to be given store credit which I have yet to use, when I DO use it it will be my last purchase there because of that practice. As for ordering from Petco, I was very satisfied with the whole experience. Will definitely order from them again.

Unfortunately this is only revealed after you almost cut your fingers by opening the horrible clam-shell packing and see it written on the reciever.

"We loved the Litter Robot LRII at first. We have two cats and one of them took to it immediately without a problem. I am not sure which one of the two cats caused the mess, but we began to see soiled wet litter on the outside of the unit. (around the control panel) The mess that one cat caused, was worse than having the regular kitty litter mess. Urine would leak inside the trash/ deposit and get everything inside wet. It was too big of a mess to clean up. I am sorry this didn't work out. It was great the first few days.",cats,2
"I tried various hairball products in the past, but my cat did not like the taste of any of them until I found this one. My cat has very dense fur, and is constantly grooming himself.

"I don't know how I went on so long without owning this litterbox. I love cats, but I hate cleaning the litter box. It's very simple to use and to throw away the disposable compartments. You don't smell when the cats have used it. I'm an owner of 3 cats and now 5 kittens. The only problem is it doesn't scoop kitten poo as easily since it's so small. But other than that, it's perfect. You might need patience with cats that are afraid of everything...I have one that is like that and he steps into the litter box very carefully. He's afraid of the litter box after he get's out since it scoops it once they've left the box...I love the litterbox!",cats,2
"This Precision Puppy Pen is great.I raise small puppies and I own 10 of these in different sizes.They open from the top and have a front door.The top opening feature is great for puppies,so they cant come piling out.When they potty it goes straight down to the bottom away from them through the floor grate.They are big enough for them to have a big bed,food and water and a potty area.Also fold completely flat for storage.Easy to clean and maintain.I would reccomend these to anyone with puppies.They also make a great and spacious pen for small adult dogs.Not small and confined like a crate.I give this product an A+++++ Rating.",dogs,3

Then I paid $93 regular shipping to send it back. They have a $60 deal with Fedex. Why would you have a return rate set up with Fedex if you didn't get a ton of returns. I learned a $90 lesson. thanks for nothing Litter robot!",cats,2

"I started buying these about 4 years ago for my miniature black rabbit. All I can say is that if I want her to go back in her cage after trying to catch her, these are perfect for enticing her. We got in the habbit of giving her these treats twice a day. One first thing in the morning and the last one at 9:00 at night. Let me tell you, if you are even 10 minutes late, you will know it because the rabbit goes crazy trying to get your attention. I just hope these things never get discontinued because then I'll be in real trouble.",bunny rabbit central,1
"Less than 24 hours after my four year old dog ate a Zuke's ""all-natural"" bone, she developed pancreatitis!!! There was no other change in her diet, environment or anything but that Zuke's bone. When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause. Stay away from this and all Zuke's ""all-natural"" products!",dogs,3
"So far, so good!! Each time she gets a new ball, it's torn up in minutes. Two days and not a mark on it....and she hasn't let it out of her sight! Would get 5 stars if the price was a bit lower, but well worth what I paid if they continue to hold up!",dogs,3

She did not like the fact that soemthing was on her nose and kept trying to pull it off but she quickly got used to it. Now she will tolerate it. Immediately she knew something was different, and once we began to walk she qucikly tried to run away. I gently (with 1 finger) pulled the leash towards me and she obeyed and walked alongside me..She was calm and obeident. I was amazed and so excited. This is the best leash ever!!!!!My skeptical husband was amazed and now walks the dog.",dogs,3

It was great, soothing for the dog and non-irritating to him. He smelled great for days. Thanks!",dogs,3
I have just thrown away my 3rd drinkwell fountain. Although my cats love the fresh H2O and the running stream....the motors burn out. I have had 2 motors fail in the past 8 months! Of course the item SHOULD be covered under the 1 yr warranty.....EXCEPT if you have hard water....tough luck for you- not covered. Believe me I cleaned these fountains every 3 weeks and changed the filters also.....BUT.... the motors still failed. So if you have hard water-watch out.I'm going to try another brand and will review that in the future.,cats,2
"Nylabones have long been my favorite chew toys for my big German Shepherds. The dogs love them, they last a long time and don't make a mess on my carpets. If my dogs take them outside, they can be washed and reused. The souper size is great for big, strong dogs and last several months even with daily chewing. I highly recommend Nylabone durable products. These are a bargain because they last so long and Amazon's price is the best anywhere, even over pet supply discount sites.",dogs,3

My dog is my life and my husband will agree so when it comes to her health I have no problem spending a little money for her teeth. I do brush her teeth most days but it is good to back it up with the Greenies. If you keep the plaque off your pup's teeth they will have a far more healhy life. This does not replace brushing their teeth but it doesn't hurt. Think of it as mouthwash for doggies.,dogs,3
"This seemed like a neat idea, and my cat had fun with it for a short while. However, it was very easily pulled off the door-knob (I safety-wired it in place so it would stay put), and the pom-pom thing is not at all durable. Within a week, only a small shard of it remains on the string. Would have been a much better deal if the pom-pom wasn't so sorely lacking in durability.",cats,2

"I have a very fuzzy Australian Shepherd mix dog, and I live in an area of PA that has a major flea and tick problem. I have used Frontline Plus since I got my dog (about a year ago) and she has never had a flea OR tick problem.

I am VERY happy to have received this product for such a low price! Just be careful of the fakes and check the seller info. Also, for those who have had problems with this product being ineffective, make sure you are applying it to your dog's SKIN not fur :)",dogs,3

This is the best Aquarium glass cleaner I have ever had. Cleans great. You can go around the corners and it floats so you can catch it on the other side.

You can't go wrong with this Mag Float.,fish aquatic pets,4

"I have been giving this to my dogs for about 2 years and have had great success with it. They have firm, healthy stools, no digestive upsets, and healthy, shiny coats. When I first started giving it, I found that they would get loose stools if I gave too much too soon, so I started them on small amounts and slowly increased the dosage with no problems.A couple of months ago, I thought they didn't need it any more so I stopped giving it to them when the bottle was empty. Big mistake! Within a week, both dogs had loose stools and one dog threw up twice. Back on they went and no problems since.",cats,2
"I anticipated a great reaction from my dogs. Much to my dismay they didn't go near it except to sniff! The problem is that it is too full! It's like a huge, grossly overstuffed pillow.

"You know what I hate about cat scratchers? They are UGLY! Who wants an obnoxious carpet wrapped pole hanging out in their living area? That is why I nearly swooned when I saw SmartCat's offering on Amazon. After living with this scratcher for 4 months, I can tell you it is as beautiful as I hoped (well, as beautiful as a scratching post can be) and our cat uses it for 95% of her scratching needs (I don't think a lifetime of squirts from a water bottle will ever curb her love affair with our green armchair). After mounting it to the wall, this scratcher almost disappears from view. Happiness.",cats,2
"This is the second one of these I've had now. The first one lasted about 2 years, then for some reason started leaking out of the cap when inverted on a hike. Maybe water froze in it and expanded it over the winter. All in all, however, I liked it enough to order another. My dog has strong opinions about what she'll drink water out of. She does not like the fold-up, packable nylon bowls. She likes this trough a lot. I usually just pour the water into it, rather than using the spray lid. The spray is a nice fine mist if your dog likes being misted. Mine has an opinion about that, too! This is actually a convenient way to carry her water as long as I wear pants with a belt to hang it from. I wish there were an equally brilliant design to take when we go running though. It also works well for us in the car when we run errands.",cats,2
"Our one year old westie can chew up almost anything. I've spent lots of money on toys that were made for aggressive chewers, and were destroyed 20 minutes later. This treat dispenser is great. We've had it several months and it's still in excellent condition. I read reviews before purchasing, and bought the larger size because it had a rope instead of a plastic piece. I definitely recommend the rope. I was afraid the larger size would be too big, but Max loves it. He weighs 15 lbs.",dogs,3
"I'd heard great things about the Furminator, but just couldn't see spending sixty dollars on a brush. When I saw the brush offered on Amazon for half that price, I bought 2.Now I don't know how I lived without it so long! We have 5 dogs (a couple with thick coats, one with a long coat, and a couple with short coats), and we spent about an hour the first day brushing all of them. It was incredible how much fur came off each of the dogs. We brushed them again the next day and still got tons of fur off. The great thing was that for the next week, they hardly shed in the house at all. I was used to getting a hand full of fur each time I pet any of them, but I didn't get a single hair that entire week. We make a point to brush all of them each week now, but we really focus on the 2 with thick undercoats.The dogs really enjoy being brushed, so that was a bonus.I don't know how the brush works...but I can tell you that it definitely works!",cats,2

"This product is a complete waste of money. It does not scoop most of the clumps out, so we are still hand-cleaning multiple times per day. Small clumps are totally left behind, larger ones often either stick to the tines, do not make it up the hill to the receptacle or jam the receptacle door open. And the odor control?? Please...Does not work at all.The only positive thing I can say is that we bought this from Petsmart on Black Friday, so only paid about 30% of the retail price. If I had paid full retail, I'd be fuming!DO NOT BUY!!",cats,2
"Only use this product for a few days. Recently I bought a few and right out of the package the paint was peeling right off of them like they weren't adhered properly. When I tried Trimline Inc. customer service, several different times after contacting once I was told by a rather rude gentlemen that they had investigated it and found nothing wrong on their end (they hadn't even seen what was wrong with my items), he claimed it must have been my dog chewing on it or being active and ruining it. My dog is 16 years old! and did not chew on it. It's ashame because before this I had no problems. Like I said at the beginning, they are ok to use for a few days, but if something goes wrong with them the company seems to not backup their product and are very, very rude.",dogs,3

Thank you to the other customers who suggested that people buy a medium Treat Ball. My little dogs popped the treat out of the small one in a matter of minutes. When I first brought home the medium Treat Ball I was afraid that my three little ten pound dogs couldn't lift it. They had no problem lifting it and they couldn't pop out the treat. I had to buy three so they could each have their own. It was a good investment because they last at least a week and they really enjoy it.A few months after my review....My little dogs destroyed three of these. I still gave the ball four stars because I can't find anything else comparable. I don't like to give them too much rawhide.,dogs,3
"One of my dogs is a yorkie/pomeranian cross and her fur is beautiful, but oh so difficult. She has the dreaded double-coat, but most of the undercoat and leg hair is the super fine, silky and easily knotted yorkie texture fur but the length and coarseness of pomeranian fur on the top coat. Even when I get her groomed, it only lasts about a week before we start getting tangles, even with multiple brushings per day.I washed her with Dr. Bronner's Baby Mild Castile Soap (http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Magic-Soaps-Castile/dp/B003OUI4XS) and rather than conditioner her like usual, I just rinsed her and then sprayed this on as I would a leave-in conditioner. I blew her dry with a hairdryer and comb, spritzing on more when I hit patches that didn't easily detangle.I have never seen her this soft or sleek, even when coming back from the groomer. I was VERY impressed. She smells good (the smell is not very strong, but not particularly nice--just kind of fresh) and again, she is SO SOFT. I will be interested to see how long this effect lasts, if it lasts 2+ weeks, I will be happy. Less than that and I will edit my review. But I am very happy with it right now, because thus far even when her feet and paws get wet on walks, she doesn't retangle once dry. Even though she loves to give a quick roll in grass and dirt, it seems to repell more easily--like it says.After washing her, I didn't feel like washing my short-haired chihuahua/terrier mix (who has short, glossy, but very thick fur) so I just sprayed her down dry and gave her a quick brush. It has made her significantly softer as well and she seems to be repelling dirt more, too.Conclusion",dogs,3
"I purchased this collar with the hopes of using it to train my little dog. The collar does work, it does get the dogs attention, but my dog quickly got used to the vibration. Now when I ""buzz"" her, she shakes her head and keeps on doing whatever it was I was telling her not to. The tone is ok, not loud as others have already stated. I'm going back to clicker training and hope that the positive reinforcement will work better for me then the collar did. The other issue I had is the remote is quite large, I wish it had a clasp or lanyard.",dogs,3
"OK, so I saw this after searching for something to quiet the neighbor dog's incessant barking at all hours of the night and it seemed like a great idea. However, it seems to suffer from mixed reviews and I suspect that it's because it is such a small and under-powered device. Imagine trying to annoy your neighbors by cranking up a small handheld radio. It just doesn't quite cut it. The thing is probably like a gnat in the dog's ear, so it may get the idea or it may not.So I considered other possibilities and discovered what I feel is a better idea",dogs,3
"This product has worked for me and the people I know who use it. Whether it's for starting a new tank or for use after killing the bacteria bed when medicating a tank. I've seen it cull a nitrite spike and keep new tank syndrome from happening. For larger tanks, a bottle wouldn't last long, but it's definitely worth it. I mean, who wants to wait to start a tank, or who wants to watch their fish die from ammonia or nitrite poisoning. So I would get a 500 mL bottle if you have anything bigger than a 20 or 29 gallon. That way you'll have some to start the tank and some later on, just in case. I've only seen it used for freshwater aquariums.",fish aquatic pets,4
"The crate was easy to put together and it is sturdy. My eighty-five pound Lab has plenty of room to stretch out, sit and stand.

The only outcome was she ran when I got close to her face. I tried Angels Eyes supplement and by her next hair cut (about 3 weeks) her face was completely clean and stays that way with a teaspoon of product in her food each day. She's much happier now that I'm not messing with her eyes all the time and has quit flinching when I get near her face. Good Job, Angels Eyes.",dogs,3
"After I received this product I quickly realized that $62 was too much to pay for it. Easily assembled, no directions required but very very flimsy and unsteady. Once I put the cages in it did sturdy up a bit more but it was a challenge to get the cages to fit. The bars were not cut correctly so they do not fit as snugly as they should either. The bottom tier is too close to the floor for any birds comfort so a firm piece of plywood works great for a shelf. If you do not have to worry about the cage being bumped by dogs or kids it is great, but it takes very little to shake the whole thing and ""rattle"" the birds with it.",birds,0

"I bought this litter box about three weeks ago. I read a million reviews on it and thought it would be a great product minus the expense of the trays every two weeks (I have two cats). I use to clean out the litter box every five days or so because of the smell. So after ready a ton of reviews I saw that people were using liners on the disposable tray to extend its life span. I didnt know which ones so use so I tried it out with the ones I had on hand. They are the tidy Cat liners for multiple cats. they come in a little yellow box, about four per box. My cats dig and scratch like crazy in their regular litter box so i was a bit skeptical about them breaking the bag and it getting caught on the rake. So this is what i did. I laid down an UNOPENed liner on top of the disposable tray and taped the sides down. if you don't tape it down properly, litter crystals will get under the bag and not let the rake pass (or so i read from reviews) Also, before taping it down, I made sure that the liner was flush against the tray so that when I filled it with the litter, it would'nt create air gaps that could end up being torn by the cats. It worked great!! 16 days later when it was time to change out the litter, i untaped the liner and easily picked it up from the 4 corners and into the trash. Easy peasy!! From changing it out I noticed the lid of the poop cover had gotten a little wet so i taped it up. i use clear packing tape for everything. Next time i buy a new tray I'll tape up the poop cover right away. I plan on buying a new tray every two months or so instead of every two weeks. The tray looked brand new when i removed the used liner and litter so i may be able to use it for more than two months. we shall see.",cats,2

"You're supposed to be able to use this box without liner bags. If you do that, cat pee and litter clump together on the bottom of the box and smells it up horribly. There are no bags that I have found that are big enough to fit this litter box, so we end up stretching a ""jumbo"" liner which causes rips and holes and the litter ends up going underneath the bag after you flip it to empty the dirt.

"I gave this thing the benefit of the doubt after reading some of the reviews on here, like how the turtles will start chowing down on the dock. My turtles are extreme wimps. They won't even eat the tiny goldfishes that I had in the tank. This brings me to exactly how horrible this dock is. I don't know if they did something new or found a new way to make this thing, but the minute I took it out of the box, I felt this weird oil and it was extremely sandy, like the styrofoam was disintegrating in my hand. Maybe it was just extra parts of it. I can't tell. The dock was also very dark, almost black, with spots of green, I guess to look like algae or grass or something, but it wasn't pretty. It didn't look like the picture on the box at all! I thought I had received someone's used one until I did a little research. Anyways, back to oil. I proceeded to clean the dock, with a very mild dish washing detergent so it'll cut through the oil and hopefully wash it away. After, I soaked the dock in clean water for 2 days, TWO DAYS, changing water twice a day to make sure any traces of detergent would be gone. On the second day, there was still oil coming out of the dock, but it was very little. To the point where I had to look for it so again, gave it benefit of the doubt, put it into my tank. My turtles loved it. They immediately started playing on it, but the goldfishes that I had in the tank all died, within 30 minutes. They've been in the tank with my turtles for almost 2 weeks now!! They've literally became friends with my turtles!! I immediately pulled out my turtles. My turtles are okay, but the oil or whatever the dock was emitting CANNOT be good for any sea creatures.

No matter how often I cleaned it, it always seemed to get slimy and gross, especially on the "" ramp"". The next one was the regular Drinkwell fountain. I WISH I would've spent a little more to get the Drinkwell Platinum , because when I travel, with 3 cats at home, in less than 2 days the water level would be low enough where it was loud and sounding like the motor was burning out?

"I had a chance to use one of these that a relative purchased at a vetinarian clinic for $45 and I was amazed at the impressive job it did.. I found one on line, but it was only $9.95. I was sceptical that it was as good a product as the $45 one, but it is the same brand and NOT a knock-off. It is even larger than the small-dog $45 one, as I ordered the large-dog style. WELL worth the money and shipping cost. Less than $15 and I'm very happy.",cats,2

"This is a great sifter scoop for Feline Pine. I had a cheap scooper from the pet store and noticed that it collected feces on it and got all moldy and gross! This scoop does not do that and it sifts the unused pellets right back into your litter box. Feline Pine litter, the ""official"" sifting box and this scoop are all really great. It's the best experience I've ever had dealing with a litter box! Plus it's much better for the environment, my cat and my house! Cannot recommend Feline Pine stuff enough.",cats,2
"Before trying this shampoo, I used Dr Bronner's magic soup for my big labrador. Since my dog is really big and likes to roll around in dirt, he often smells bad. Dr Bronner's didn't help much with the smell. Cain $ Able shampoo worked better. Although it didn't make my dog smell like flowers as I expected, he does smell fresher and his coat has been much softer and shinier. Also he seems to have less flea problem. I haven't used any flee medicine for him for a few weeks. Just by showering him with this shampoo, he didn't seem to have fleas so far.",dogs,3

"Puppy loves her crate. The best part is the divider (once you get it in place). I am crate training now so it is good to have a smaller space that will keep puppy from voiding in her den, and to later be able to move the divider as she grows so that I don't have to buy a new crate later.I would suggest buying or borrowing a small carrier though as this crate (medium) is not suitable for travel in most cars (unless you have an SUV).The divider is a bugger to insert and move around, but once in place it's great. The crate is almost fully assembled when it comes. It unfolded and was together is about a minute or two. Took about 15 frustrating minutes to get the divider in place. GREAT first buy for new furry friends.Oh, btw, picking the right size was the biggest headache when considering buying a crate. There is a really good sizer on [...] I have a rat terrier and she will go from puppy size (about 2.5 pounds at 8 weeks) to full grown (about 17 pounds and about the same length and width of a Jack Russell Terrier) VERY comfortably in a medium sized crate.",dogs,3

"I was doubtful that this would work as it said it did - but I have been searching for years (yes, years)to find a solution for the excess cat litter that gets all over the house....

Most of the litter is caught on the steps - and I have 2 cats - and they took to it without even having to do the ""here it is "" routine. AND I no longer have to vacuum and sweep every day. Not that there are not drawbacks - getting the litter off the steps is a bit of challenge - I am considering a hand held ""whisk"" broom and I had to take the round top off out of the top - so it is open on the top as I have one cat that freaks out in closed spaces. The upside of removing the round top in the top is that you do not have to invest in the filters - as it is open to the air.I can not say enough about it - and have recommended to it several folks already!",cats,2

"After trying 3 types of cat window shelves (all fell within minutes of the cat getting on them), decided to get one of these instead--added bonus was the scratching post since their old one came unraveled). It's nicely heavy so the cats can't tip it over, post is 35"" tall so it gives the cats enough length to really go at it, post is covered in sisal not carpet (huge plus for that). Originally after buying got a message that said it'd take about 3 months to get to us, which was fine, but it was suddenly there after only 2 weeks. The only problem is whenever the little female cat gets up on the cradle, the male no matter what else he was comfortably snuggled into has to get up and chase her off. I'd get another one but we don't have any more room. I thought the cats would be uncomfortable in the cradle since it isn't cushioned (just plain carpet) but they don't seem to mind at all. Male is too long for the cradle so part of him stick out--but he doesn't care. Female fits in it tidily. It's well made, well thought out, and we're all very happy with the product.",cats,2

"I have had the catgeneie for about 5 months now. It clogged 2 times in the first two weeks. Since then I back wash the drain hose every other day. Just listen for the glug glug of the water and you know the hose is clear. My catgenie is next to a utility sink and drains into the washer outlet, so it makes it easy to do. Since then no clogs.Also my two cats didn't take to it very well. I put a plant caddie inside the catgenie and filled it with regular litter and they were using the catgenie with the washable granules the next day.Also I would get the catgenie cartridge reset and refill your catridges.It too works great. I use a petsafe odor and stain remover from petsmart. It has a mild detergent and nonpathogenic bacteria as active ingredients.The granules do stick to their paws, but no more litter to lug around and no more dust makes up for that small problem.All and all I have had good luck with the product.

"This product is an incredible waste of money, at least for a single-cat household. The construction is shoddy, the components are cheap, and the design of the litter receptacle clips can cause a full one to snap suddenly out of place while removing it, which can create a much bigger mess than the scoop ever did. I'll try lining the receptacles with plastic bags as one reviewer suggested... Also, I had to scrape litter-and-urine cement off the bottom of the old box, with the Littermaid I get to scrape it off the rake as well. Yaaay. And you'd better wear goggles if that rake ever gets stuck with the motor grinding away...I don't know what kind of toxoplasmosis you can get when it flings a chunk of cat litter in your eye, but I'll know soon.",cats,2

It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily.We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones.Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.I did not buy Nylabones here.

"I bought this for my two dogs because we were having a problem with ticks. I kept finding them on their fur, and while they weren't attached the whole thing made me really nervous. My dog Yogi had been given this product before we brought him home from the shelter, and since he never had fleas it seemed like it was working well. When I received it I put it on both of my dogs--Toby & Yogi. Yogi did fine; Toby was an entirely different story. After 30-40 minutes, he was shaking, vomiting, lethargic, had accidents in the house. I was terrified! I called Merial to speak with one of their ""vet techs"" about what was happening, and they said there was no way to get the product off and there was no one there who could explain to me what to do or who to contact (emergency vet? poison control?) or what was happening. They actually told me to call back TOMORROW. I called my vet who gave me the number of an emergency vet. The emergency vet told me to scrub off the frontline with dawn dish soap and to watch him for improvement. Sure enough, an hour after getting it all scrubbed off, he was still very weak and tired but no longer vomiting or shaking. I called my vet today to let them know that he was okay. I'm not bothering with Merial. I cannot understand why they would sell a product and advertise vet techs on staff and then have absolutely no recourse or help when a negative side effect occurs. Amazon was much better to deal with for this issue. They allowed me to send the product back for a refund even though it had been opened. I'm glad that they stand by the items they sell. I'm going to stick with eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil for my dog. It works well with a flea comb, but it is more work.",dogs,3

"This is a great product that actually works to keep ants out of pet food. The concept is simple -- fill the bottom part of the tray with water and a squirt of dish soap, place the top part on, then put the pet food dishes on top of that. Ants crawl onto the bottom tray, up the wall and into a soapy death.The only ""gotcha"" is to make sure that nothing can form a ""bridge"" between the floor (or other adjacent objects) and the top of the tray -- if your pet is a slob like mine, and drags its food dish halfway off onto the floor, the ants will gain easy access. In this case, avoid placing anything that can be dislodged, or anchor the dish with Velcro(tm).Check the water level regularly and top up as needed. This WILL solve your ants-in-the-pet-food problems, indoors or out.",cats,2
"We bought this for our cats almost 6 years ago and it has been running 24/7 ever since. It still works like it did when it was new. I'm very impressed. The only part that we had to replace was the reservoir and that is because I dropped and cracked it. The good thing is that of any one part breaks or wears out, you can order a replacement part. We change the filters about 1x a month for 2 cats. We use filtered water in it and I wash it thoroughly 1x a week.We have 2 cats and they love this! They used to ""ask"" us to turn the faucet on for them to drink from bu now, they have running water all the time, whenever they want it. I don't know what it is that makes it so cute but I just love watching them lap from it. They surely rink more water now which is great for kidney health as well.We leave the cover off the front top part because they also like to drink from the top where the water flow over the edge. We bought this for $70, which felt steep, but even at that price, it's absolutely worth every penny! For the $42 price it is a bargain!

"I have a large dog and wanted to provide him with water when he's in his crate. I chose this bottle because of its size. At 1/2 gallon, it will last for about 1 1/2 to 2 days.Some other reviewers have complained about leakage. My experience has been that it will drip for a minute or two when it's just been filled, as it hasn't yet built up enough vacuum to hold the water in. You can help this along by inverting the bottle and squeezing it once or twice prior to attaching it to the crate, which will build up a vacuum. I used to do that, but I don't anymore because (1) it doesn't drip that much water anyway, and (2) my dog sees the dripping and comes right on over and drinks from the bottle and then it doesn't drip anymore.I'm very happy with the product and will buy another when this one wears out.",dogs,3

"I bought the small one so I could use it on my cats and medium-sized dog. It works pretty well on the cats, but my dog has coarse, thick hair (Corgi), and I have a difficult time getting it through to the skin. The blades are the same on all sizes, so the size isn't the problem. It works okay, but because the blades are short and close together, I have to press hard to get it through her coat. It seems to pull and hurt her a little, so I stopped using it on her. I found a different product yesterday for her--Oster makes one called ShedZilla that has longer, wider, and safely blunted blades that easily go through even her hair, AND she seemed to enjoy it! So if your pet has this kind of hair, the FURminator might not work as well as you hoped. It is pretty good for shorter, thinner, or finer coats though.",cats,2

"Couple tips for anyone planning on installing the fence themselves.-Rent a cable trencher from the hardware store. They are made specifically to bury cable into the ground.The one I rented worked very well and I was able to get 500ft of cable done in about 3 hours (finishing touches took about another hour).-Don't use the wire that comes with the kit. I found the insulation very thin and was obvious cost saving part of the kit.The hardware store in my area sold spools of ""Pet Containment"" wire in the electrical section. It is probably 5x thicker insulation and worked very well with the trencher.-If your yard has lots of clay make sure to wet down the path you plan to take before using the trencher. Using it on damp soil seemed to work the best.-Use something to mark the straightaway's. I found that it was hard to keep the trencher going straight unless I had something to follow. I used my garden hose and followed next to that with the machine.-Plan to have some extra soil handy to fill in spots as needed. I needed to fill in pretty much the entire length of the trench to make sure the wire stayed in place.Good luck!",dogs,3

I would say overall this is a great product for people that are going to be home at least once a day. I have two cats and they are both fine with the large omega paw box. So far I have not had a major issue the only thing I was worried about was my larger cat but he just has his head and upper body hanging out while he does his business. I can see it being an issue if you have a larger cat that likes having his space since about half the box is taken up by the trap and pull out container.The Pros as far as I can see is that you never really have to worry about having cat litter flying every where when you scoop. After the set up it is pretty simple just add the litter and roll it when your cats do their business. Sometimes when it is upside down you have to hit the bottom to make sure everything falls off. Then just take the scoop out and done.The negatives I mainly have run into is that you have to refill the litter more often and also the other big problem is if you let the cats go more than 2 days max you will have to perform the movement a few times or may have to give in and scoop the litter. Sometimes you can avoid the litter all collecting on one end by tilting the box forward after it is upright then hold in the catch bin and give the box a little shake. Still best way to avoid this mess is just doing the litter once or twice a day so you don't have to deal with the potential mess.All and all I would say a great product as long as you plan to use it as a daily litter box and not a litter box while you are traveling for extended periods of time. So when you buy this one don't throw out your old box because unfortunately you will have to use it for trips longer than 2 days or face the wraith of unhappy cats upon your return.,cats,2
"*UPDATE*We just purchased our third tire for our dogs. It continues to be one of their very favorite toys. We find that with our two dogs wrestling with this toy, it lasts for about a year. Not bad considering how aggressive my dogs are with the toy.*ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW*My dog is a big chewer and we recently put in hardwood floors. I bought this toy hoping that it would hold up to his aggressive chewing and that it would be softer on the floors than some of his hard plastic bones. He loves it and it is so cute watching him carry it around in his mouth. So far there are no signs of damage form his teeth.Our favorite game is to place one of his balls inside the tire for him to try and get out.",dogs,3

I have a 6 month old lab puppy who is way too smart for her own good. She is into everything and I swear suffers from ADD. I got this so I could have a few moments peace and it worked!

"We have two 90 pound dogs and it felt like we were filling their water bowl every 4 hours. I love the 3 gallon capacity, and now we refill the water every 4-5 days which is great. My complaint, though, is that it is cheaply made and very hard to line the threads up to put the top back on. We wrestle with it for several minutes every time and we never know how it will line up in relation to putting it back in the container. If its off a little, its very hard to open the top to let the water out.I love that the water lasts 4-5 days. If it didn't, this would be returned because of the hassle with the top every time.",cats,2

"We've had a few different small animals and experimented with different cages and water bottles and have found this one to be the best by far. Small animals like gerbils and hamsters NEED to chew on stuff, and unfortunately it sometimes is their water bottle or other wire or plastic cages or toys. They need to be housed in an aquarium, first of all, so they cannot chew on the walls and latches, etc. We've owned plastic and wire cages in the past only to quickly replace them all with glass aquariums with a wire mesh top. That said, the only reasonable solution for the water bottle for the little fellas was this one because it's small, can be situated up high enough that they can't chew it, sticks on with double-sided tape, and is easily removed for filling. The other bottles we've had (many!) were all something that was bulky and hung down so far they would climb on them and chew on them. The glass one we had was fine until they chewed the whole cork off around the glass tube and we couldn't open it ever again. Gerbils in particular don't drink a lot, (and therefore don't pee a lot) so the bottle can be very tiny, which is why this one is perfect. The floating turtle inside makes it very easy to glance in and check the water level, too.",birds,0
"I'm an animal trainer and behaviorist, and spend the majority of my time working with dogs with behavioral problems. I consider aversives to be a last ditch effort to save a dog's life when all else fails, and I'm happy to say that, thanks to StayAway, I haven't ever had to use more severe products like the Scat Mat (which emits an electric shock when touched.)I use this product primarily for stopping counter-surfing dogs when alternatives aren't enough. A few StayAways placed strategically along the counter tops has successfully stopped even the most hardcore counter surfing dogs from stealing things off the counter or table - even when the counter is baited with a tasty treat like broiled chicken - after just a few sprays. I do not typically use the warning beep, but it is a handy function to have!I've tried Premier's comperable product, and was highly dissatisfied with the quality, among other things, so decided to try Contech's product instead. I now have four StayAways, and only turn them on while in the process of training; my only gripe about this product is that when turned on, it emits three blasts of air (which wastes the product) and it still eats through batteries. I would also really like a wider range of adjustability, and a narrower blast of air. Despite these flaws, the product does what it claims to do, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with it!",cats,2

"I have five dogs and several of these crates. I have tried other brands to try to save some money because these are a little pricey but I have found in the long run well worth the money. Petsmart used to carry these but they no longer carry them at my local store. I tried one of their other brands and when I went to put my dog up for the night the edges were so sharp they sliced my finger open. This happened twice and then I threw the crate out. I then tried another brand. That crate lasted 8 months and then broke. That's when I looked for these on Amazon. My first petmate crate is now at least 8 yrs old and is used everyday. I had read some of the other reviews where others had safety problems. This is only happened once with one of my dogs. My large boxer learned that if he headbutted the top of his crate the sides would fall in and he could get out. A few zipties solved that problem. He has a 48 inch crate so it isn't moved very often. My dogs have never been hurt using these crates and furthermore I haven't either. However, I wouldn't recommend leaving your dog alone for an extended period of time until you know how they will react. (But that should be a rule for any crate) :)",dogs,3
"This item just arrived and my cat is very interested in it. The post is sturdy and easy to assemble. However, the heads of the screws that were included to attach the base are too big to ""sink"", so they protrude on the bottom. This makes the base a bit wobbly and worst of all, can damage my hardwood floors!! I hope the manufacturer will quickly send new screws to replace these that do not go deep enough into the composite wood base!! Otherwise, sadly, it will have to go back. If you have carpeted floors, this may not be an issue for you.I will update if Amazon/manufacturer sends screws that fit better.",cats,2
"We have had this product for one week and our dog is currrently out having a great time chasing squirrels. She seemed to learn the system in about 2 days. Flags were more for us than her. She knows when she hears the beeps to head back to the house. She is better behaved now in the house because she can expend so much energy running and playing outside. She is a bordrer collie mix with plenty of energy. The collar does give some random beeps when in the house, the company said this was due to so many frequencies in the house. Remedied by keeping collar off in the house. I am not at the comfort level of leaving her outside when we are gone, but it has worked perfectly for our needs, which is for her to play and get exercise.",dogs,3

"This is a rather expensive nail trimmer that does not do a good job of cutting my dog's nails. First, I think the blade is geared for a smaller dog (even though the one I own is supposed to be for a ""mid-sized"" dog), it takes a lot of hand strength to cut the actual nail. Then, it shatters the nail rather than cuts it, so you end up with splinters, rather than a clean nail slice.On top of that, this trimmer is supposed to find the quick, well the only time is gives you the green light is when the trimmer is away from the dog's nail. Even when I placed the trimmer on the very tip of the nail, it still glowed red.Bottom line -- great idea, bad product.",cats,2

"This is our 3rd jug. My dog Loooooves it and eats his dinner out of it every night. Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!",dogs,3
"I have to admit - I was skeptical. My wife read about the Furminator online and showed me some of the reviews. Typically,what you read and what you get are two different things. Obviously, being the male, I knew I would lose any argument about getting it once she decided that it was the greatest thing invented. Between you and I - she was right. Well, not 'greatest' thing ever, but certainly the best dog product we have ever purchased. The furmintator is easy to use and will amaze you with the amount of hair it will remove in one stroke. We have 2 Labs and both seem to enjoy getting brushed. It is amazing when we are done - the pile of hair is nearly as big as they are (a slight exaggeration - but still a lot of hair). This is easy to use and does exactly what it says. If you have walking hair balls like we do - this is a must purchase.",cats,2

"Great for trips to vet and the removable wire door allows me to keep carrier out for cat to use (and get used to) without worrying he will get locked inside. Easy to assemble and clean. Comes with top ""pocket"" that holds clip-on water/food cup and if using the cup, leash fits nicely into pocket. Has top loop to secure door for airline requirements (you have to provide your own rope or whathaveyou to thread through loop and mesh door).The only drawback is that the opening for the door is narrow--metal door takes up 1.5 inches of 7.25 inch opening and only opens straight out (not flat to side). For a cat who doesn't like carriers, makes it tricky to get him in without hooking a foot or knocking door shut. (I grab carrier between my legs upright and ""drop"" cat in).",cats,2
"The Kong Jump 'N Jack is a great product for the pet who likes to chase things. When tossed, it will bounce around irregularly, which engages your dog in a wonderful game of ""is it alive?""

"We needed something to keep our dog from jumping on to the kitchen counters (especially when my wife or I weren't looking). This has worked great ever since December 2011.Our dog has quickly learned that the warning beeps means that he should move out of the area. He gets a little worried when other things start beeping, but he gets over it quickly.We don't put it on every day, but I have noticed a couple times when the collar didn't seem to work. It seems to only happen if the collar is turned on too far away from the base station.My only real complaint is that since the barrier field is spherical, so it just doesn't keep him off the counter, it keeps him out of most of the kitchen. If we decrease the range to it's minimum, it doesn't restrict all the counter space. Depending on your desired use, this may or may not work.Overall, this product works great. The warning beeps before the shock are great so you know your best friend isn't always getting shocked. The shock itself is not really painful (yes, I've tested it on myself).",dogs,3

But if you're thinking you can use this as a depilatory for back hair, think again. It won't work and you'll just be frustrated.",cats,2

"I have an in home child care, 2 dogs and 3 birds.I have tried just about every product on the market that is suppose to remove stains from carpets. I ran across this product and figured what the heck. Oh my gosh! am I glad that I picked it up. It has removed pet stains and stains from kids juice cups that nothing else would remove. I even tried it on some stains on clothing and it removed those as well. There is no longer anything else in my cabinet but Kids and Pets.Follow the directions on the bottle and you will have no porblems. There were some stains that had been there for a while, that took a couple of treatments to get out but they are now gone also.",dogs,3
"This is a needed product for fish in a controlled environment. Helps them get the added vitamins that some of the lesser foods lack, and if you use a high quality food like Oceans Choice, it an added bonus for the fish as well. Easy to use, my fish are all healthy and happy and I attribute a large part of that to this product. If you have fish, BUY IT!",fish aquatic pets,4

"This product stinks chemicals so strong - when I just opened the package, my poor dog rushed to the other room and barked! I hung this coat outside in the backyard for already two weeks, tried to wash the stink away - nothing works! It smells like naftalin and causes headache and seasick. Biological weapon of mass distruction!",dogs,3
"I highly recommend Halo eye wash to everybody! First, it seemed a little complicated to mixe the solution but personally it worth it a 1000 times. My dog (lhasa apso mix) has got reddish, brownish eye discharge a week ago, after the first application her eyes got visibly better. After 3 days, her eyes are healthy and clean, no discharge,colors.I will use this product whenever needed. I also like that it contains natural ingredients.",cats,2

I have had this product now for 4 months and I find it worse than the traditional style. Maybe my two cats make more of a mess than others but this thing needs constant cleaning. Also with normal litter scoops you can't get to everything in the rounded corners. The steps save most litter from the floor but some still gets out and they have litter on them constantly. I don't see where this is any better than products that cost 1/2 the price.,cats,2

"Nine pounds doesn't sound like much, but believe me, it's a LOT of hay. I have one rabbit about 6-8lbs. He grazes on Timothy Hay all day long and the 9lb bag lasts him almost 6 months. I have two air-tight dog food containers I use to store his hay so it's always fresh when I refill his hay feed bale. Oxbow grows great hay, but make sure you have some air-tight containers to store the unused hay so it doesn't get stale and/or attract bugs.",small animals,5
"Designed for the Catit drinking fountain, which my two cats love. It took some getting used to for them, but they drink more water now. Filters are reasonably priced and last a decent time before needing to be changed. If you run out of filters, you can temporarily take the filter in the drinking fountain, rinse it out and reinsert it. It will last long enough for your new filters to arrive. Having a new / clean filters is an absolute necessity for the fountain, not just because it keeps the water clean, but it keeps the pump quiet and a smooth stream pumping out of the fountain.",cats,2

"Purchased this bed for our dog's crate. I was very impressed with the bed when it arrived. It is very soft and the bolsters on the side are nice and thick. Our pup wasted no time in snuggling herself into it. The only downside is that the bed seems to get dirt ground into it pretty easily and it shows. However, I consider this my fault since I ordered the white one. I plan on purchasing another and will buy it in a different color next time.",dogs,3
"Yeowww! catnip is potent stuff. We buy the nip itself to sprinkle on scratchers and into cardboard boxes for our cats to enjoy. It smells strong, is long-lasting, and all of our cats love it. I also love that it's organic, and I highly recommend loose Yeowww! catnip for any and all nip-loving kitties.Yeowww! catnip-stuffed toys are filled with nothing but the same potent, organic catnip without any dinky fillers, which would make for an amazing cat toy if only the toys were better made. The fabric itself is a strong, sturdy material and a good choice, but the toys simply aren't sewn together well. Since last Christmas, our cats have had 4 Yeowww! catnip toys",cats,2

I have used this product for three separate cats that have had problems over the past two years and each time I have been amazed at the quick results that this product produced. All three cats immediately went to the box and started going there each time they had to go- no more problems. I highly recommend this product with two paws up!,cats,2
"We have a young cat(18mos) that has flawlessly used the litterbox from a kitten. Following product instructions we were successful in the first two phases of training. When we removed the second ring, our cat began to look for other places to eliminate, with the result that we now have three separate places in our house with stains on wool carpet.The odor is finally fading(to us) but in spite of repeated enzyme & steam treatments & reversion to the traditional litterbox, our cat continues to regard these areas as places to 'go'. We have had to barricade these zones in the house, and that's a pretty awful way to live. If you choose to try this product, be sure to scoop within minutes of you cat's use, keep as much litter in the device as possible, and take the unit off the toilet AT LEAST every other day and clean and dry it. Molds and foul odors develop on the underside facing the commode water, and your cat will smell this before you do and refuse to use the CitiKitty. Good luck with it!",cats,2
"As one of my cats tends to be troublesome and doesn't always seem to find the litter box when she needs it... I spent a TON of time hunting for the best cleaner for cat urine stains. After reading countless reviews I purchased a few different cleaners, and this one is very good! Both odor and stain practically vanish when you spray it one the area, a tiny bit of scrubbing and it is completely gone - for good!If you have trouble with cat urine stains, this product is great!EDIT",dogs,3

"Great product! My dog is a very strong, powerful, athletic girl. (I am not.) She swims, does jump training, plays frisbee and goes on a 1-2 mile walk twice daily. The collar takes some getting used to (for human and canine) but the pleasure of a positive interaction is worth the effort.For 1st time buyers, please purchase a collar that includes the instructional DVD. The information and helpful tips were invaluable.A side note",dogs,3
Bought this on advice that it would be much easier on our Pit Bull and on us. Absolutely love it. Cannot believe that something so small could make leading a dog so easy without any straining. Highly recomend it to anyone for any size dog.,dogs,3
Really helped us to handle the dog around. We have a 14 year old dalmatian and it has been great for him and for us!!,cats,2
This is by far the best leash I have ever owned. It's the first retractable leash I have used. I don't think I will ever go back to a regular leash. It's very easy to use and my dog loves it too. I bought the extra long size for my medium size dog. I knew it would be better made than the small dog leashes. Love it!,dogs,3

"I discovered these pads a couple of months ago, and it's the end of a years-long absorbency quest (yes, I need to get a life). I have two toy poodles who are primarily paper-trained (actually, indoor-outdoor); they indulge in competitive peeing, so the papers get a real workout. Contrary to another reviewer's experience, I found the Four Paws brand frustratingly under-absorbent; they also had too many defects, with the padding unevenly distributed and occasionally absent in some areas. For a while I thought I'd found a solution with the Advance pads - more expensive but more absorbent - and then the manufacturer ""improved"" them and my floors were soaked. Forget about any of the cheapo brands; they're like using cut-rate paper towels instead of Bounty. Gridlocks are by far the best product out there - much more absorbent than even Advance at its best. Buy them and your puppies will be free to pee without fear of embarrassing run-off!",cats,2

"If I could give this a half star I would. It is horrible. I had a Littmaid for almost 7 yrs with little to no problem. The motor finally burned out (while I was on vacation, arhhh). So I bought the new version. I can't say it enough, it's awful. It does not rake efficiently into the bin, it gets stuck on clumps which makes it keep running and it is so flimsy every time I touch it I have to put the ramp back on. DO NOT BUY!",cats,2
"We have 3 papillons, and we bought the rubber/plastic collars last year to go with our fence. At the time, I complained that the collar part should be nylon and flexible because the little shocker box thing left a large gap with the neck and collar. It's a weird fit, it made the prongs really dig in, but the collar was very loose.We just added another papillon puppy, and she's about 4lbs, and we got this collar for her. MUCH better fit. We were worried because she could have easily slipped off the older style rubber collar. This one works great!As for the battery life, yes, it sucks! I have thought about taking them apart and putting in a new battery only, and now I will try after reading the reviews. BUT, if my dogs are wearing their collars, they know it, so they do NOT test the boundary lines for at least a month after the battery has died :)",dogs,3
This ball is by far the greatest thing I've ever spent money on for my cats. My 14 year old cat even loved it and was having so much fun licking it and chasing it around. I will definitely buy more! What a fun treat for a cat.,cats,2
"This is one of the only dog toys that we have bought that was not destroyed within minutes. We have an 9 month old mastiff/shepard mix that can chew through almost anything, toys had become non-existent in our home as he would tear them apart in minutes. I bought this ball with high hopes that it would last for a week or so anyway...well we are going on a month and the ball is totally still intact. This is our pups favorite toy and gets chewed on daily. Would not hesitate buying another one.",dogs,3
"Our German Shorthaired Pointer loved his Huck so much he wouldn't stop chewing--until we had to take it from him because he chewed a piece off. West Paw has a guarantee, though, so we'll be getting another one--which we'll use for fetch instead of as a chew toy. He has a Hurley, too, which he hasn't been able to chew pieces off of yet, so he gets to keep that one. U.S.-made of non-toxic materials--an added bonus. Great toys from a great manufacturer.",dogs,3

"I bought this cat tree for my mother- in-law. After carefully reading all of the reviews that where posted we decided to purchase this one, even though same assembly was required. At first glance the instruction where confusing, but after some though it become clear that the instructions make you assemble the tree from the wrong end. If you are able to read you should be able to assemble this tree it&#8217;s not rocker science. It took us about 20 minutes not an hour like some reviews claimed. If you get pass the assembly the tree itself is nicely maid, the material is very soft and the triangles on top are a perfect resting spot for curious kittens and cats. The tree arrived by UPS with no problems. I would highly recommend this to every cat.",cats,2
"I wasn't sure what I was going to receive, since the ad didn't say how many or what size bully sticks were in the package. All I knew is that it said I was going to save a lot of money. I know how expensive bully sticks are, so I paid the $22.99 and took a chance. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised to see what was in the package when it arrived! Thre were 24 12"" large bully sticks, each individually wrapped in plastic. My dog was excited because he's never seen a bully stick that big before. It sure is nice to see his wagging tail and the little dance he does when he's happy. :-) If you can still get this deal, I recommend you go for it. I went to the PetFoodDirect website and didn't see a deal like this there, so you have to get it through Amazon.com.",dogs,3
"I got this crate for my dog because I loved the one my parents have for my family dog so much. After setting it up (which takes maybe 15 seconds), I found that its a little less sturdy than my parents'.

NOT this Kong toy!This is the ONLY toy (other Kong products as well) we have ever had that has lasted for MONTHS.We have never put any of the snack products available into the middle of any of the Kong toys. I would think if they were chewing to get to the snack, they would destroy the Kong that much faster. ??The red Kong toys are great as well for chewers, but this black Kong toy is perfect for POWER CHEWERS!Our dogs are large neutered rescue females. :) Lab, Collie, Pit bull mixes.",dogs,3

This shampoo does the job and more. No itching, no rashes or other reactions, and it leaves his coat so light and fresh-smelling for days afterward. I love that it's natural and so gentle.",cats,2
I bought this as a replacement to an old fixture my tank came with. For the price I cannot complain at all as it is priced just slightly above cheap plastic versions on ebay.

Highly recommended for an economical solution.,fish aquatic pets,4

I use the laser light when I need to catch his attention when he's far away and not looking in my direction, and it works great for that. I also sometimes need the flashlight if I need to catch his attention using the laser light but don't know exactly where he is in a dark room--very handy to have the flashlight right there at hand at those times!

"I had the misfortune of purchasing this collar. This collar is a disaster for a few reasons. First, the collar does not stay in place over the voice box. Because of the rigidity and shape of the collar and the fact that the heavy buckle is on the side of the collar, the collar will ride up and sit on the side of the dogs neck rendering it useless. Second, even when it is positioned correctly, it doesn't work. Perhaps it is the battery (which I replaced twice) or internally it is broken. Either way, stay away from this mess of a product. Petsafe should be ashamed of the poor quality.",dogs,3

"We did a lot of research on automatic litter boxes and decided on the scoopfree. We have been using it for about 3 weeks and no problems. We were worried that it would start to smell, but it doesn't. We can't detect any odor. Our cat seemed to take to the crystals fine. We left his old litterbox out for a while and just didn't clean it, and then took it away after 2-3 days and he has been fine. He loves to watch the cleaning cycle. I would definitely recommend this product.",cats,2
I recently bought a litter robot (about a month ago) and so far I am very satisfied. I have three cats so for me it is a great help to have this item.

So I would recommend this robot to everyone!,cats,2
"This thing is totally ghetto and cheap. Kitty Bear is a slender 7-8 lbs, and when he turns around inside it, he always knocks the top part off. It isn't very sturdy at all. When it starts to topple, Kitty Bear gets scared and runs. There have been a couple instances where he ran out before his dingleberries completely dropped. Good thing I keep this thing in the laundry room, which has a tiled floor.The fake plant is totally lame. I know a lot of people say to replace it, but seriously, why even include a plant that cheap?Lastly, this thing is a serious pain in the butt to clean. This thing gets nasty unless you use liners, but then that makes this become an obvious cat box, defeating the whole purpose of having it in the first place! It's now in my house with no top at all. Total waste of money.I guess it does it's main job though, which is holding cat litter and waste. 2 stars.",cats,2
"This is a great powerhead! My tank is a tall 110 gallon aquarium, and the maxi-jet 1200 in combination with my Marineland 350 power filter circulates all of the water in the tank nicely. I've placed the powerhead mid-level in my tall tank, and even the water at the very top and very bottom moves in a clockwise current. It's fun to watch my angelfishes try to fight the top-level current or my sharks/clown loaches play in the currents at the bottom of the tank. It comes with many attachments, which is great for hobbyists like me who like to change their minds (in terms of what you want to use the powerhead for) or who just like to try new things with it. The maxi-jet 1200 is probably going to be too strong for tanks smaller than 50 gallons (and even then, it may still push your fish around), so you may want to use a smaller size or utilize the attachments that come with the 1200 to control the strength of the current. Plus, the price of this product in stores is over $50, which is outrageous, but I got it off amazon for about $25!! Fantastic savings in a recession :) Overall, great product!",fish aquatic pets,4
"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. Put this product on my cat as directed. She seemed confused, didn't play as usual or eat or take her usual nap. Just happened to check side effects of this product and found an incredible number of people who lost their pets to this POISON. Luckily I had enough sense to wash it off with a mild soap and she seems to be getting back to her normal self but I won't be satisfied until I'm certain she's out of the woods.

"Set this up last night. Assembly was quick and my only addition is that I sprayed a bit of catnip on it. Just found one of mine hanging on it just as the picture shows. So far they're loving it and it appears to be very sturdy. Not thrilled with the look of the MDF, but I can likely stain or paint that. I would like the base to be a bit thicker though.... it may be perfectly sturdy for the long haul, but it looks less substantial than I would like. Would be 5 stars with a thicker base and with visible parts being wood, rather than MDF. But the cats love it, and that's the most important thing.Here we are into April and my furry lunatics are still having a blast with it. And I almost never need to yell at them for clawing the furniture or carpeting any more.... now if only they made one that was even taller.... my biggest guys don't quite get the full stretch that the others do, and a couple of the smaller ones like to climb it so much that I wish they had more to climb..... If they made one with double the height (even though that would mean a much larger and heavier base), I'd likely go for it... the furballs would be THRILLED.UPDATE -- Just as an FYI -- it is now January of 2013 and the cats are still beating this up.... yes, it's a bit worse-looking for wear, but it's still holding up and still being used daily by kitties who clearly love it.",cats,2

"I got this ""Polly Pet Products Window or Shower Bird Perch"" for about two weeks now. OMG, it is the most horrible product I've purchased for my bird. It would not stick on the bathroom wall for too long. It keeps falling off in the middle of the shower and scares my Timneh African Grey badly. He used to love showering - dancing, fluffing his feathers, and shaking his wings under the running water. However, after 3 times of falling off this perch, he will not go into the shower any more. Now, he would scream loudly and flying frantically around the bathroom every time I take him in there. Please think about the negative effect this product will have on your bird before deciding to buy it.",birds,0
"We had tried another remote spray type collar to stop our dog from doing certain behaviors. She was not phased by this type of collar. This collar has been a success on the lowest setting. I felt bad about the idea of ""shocking"" our dog for bad behavior, but tried this out on my own neck and on the lowest setting is nothing more than a tingle. With this device it is like we have a new dog. I can have her off the leash and she does not run away like she did before. The negative tone alone will correct her 85% of the time. I highly recommend this. It has made a huge difference. We even tried it out in the creek and it was waterproof as described. We could not be any happier. My wife said she would have paid double for it because of how it has changed our determined dog.",dogs,3
"I bought one of these at the local pet store because the reviews on here we so mixed. It either had 1 star or 5 stars. Also my brothers pit bull has had one for 2 years w/o destroying it.With those in mind, I gave it a chance. My puppy (7 month old Golden) had the entirety of the stuffing out, and a hole my fist could fit inside, in slightly under 2 hours.However I did not get to test the floating aspect of the toy, so I may take it back to Petco (they have 30 day return on everything they sell) and exchange it for one that just becomes a lake toy, where Duke wont have a dedicated chewing session on it. Might be perfect for that.Also, I seem to think as dogs get older their need to destroy may diminish. So that could be why the such polarized reviews. Perhaps in another couple of years my dog will get to enjoy this toy for months instead of minutes.",dogs,3

"This drink well is really great. My cats (2) really enjoy the fresh water. One thing to mention is ... it needs to be tended to consistantly. It will get dust and cat hair etc in the catch area and that needs to be pulled out. It also needs to be fully cleaned and washed out about 4+ times per year, you can do this with just a little plain dish soap and be sure to rinse it very well. However that is not a bad thing, it just keeps it fresh and last longer. NEVER let it run dry- the motor will burn out. Overall I DO recommend this product, it encourages the Cat to drink water often and if you feed them dry food at all they really NEED to drink alot of water.",cats,2

Well, the Jolly Ball is still in one piece today and still his favorite toy. He carries it around by the holes and ""kicks"" it around with his feet all the time. We have even taken it to the river where it partially sinks and he dives for it. I HIGHLY reccomend this ball for any of the massive breeds. My corgi does not like the ball at all.",dogs,3
"I had to try these treats and are rather impressed with them. I have larger dogs (bullmastiff etc) but they work well for him too. They are square, solid and obviously pretty tasty as all three of my dogs love them. There is a lot in the box and I think for the price, well worth it, being made with good stuff. I recommend to anyone who is the ""treat"" man or lady.",dogs,3

"Our puppy can become very excited on walks when meeting other dogs or people.

"This is the first time I've written a review for anything I've ever bought online. I felt it was necessary to show the true joy this product has brought me and my roommates. We have a number of obnoxious dogs next door. One is a medium sized mutt named Princess with some chow in it and the others are a pair of pugs. Princess definitely led the incessant barking that went on whenever she even caught a whiff of someone beyond her fence. I feel bad for Princess as her owners give her no time to play outside of her cubicle of a yard. However, I wasn't about to let her ruin my back porch forever. This Pet Agree mutt zapper gets her attention for a good verbal command of ""No Princess!"" She learned within the first day that barking will not be tolerated. Just a quick tap of the button perks her ears up and she no longer goes on barking tirades whenever I go out on my back porch. If you are patient with the training and reinforce good behavior with a treat it should be no problem to shut that dog up. I have a good view of the dog and she is usually within 15 feet so the product rains down high frequency training deliciousness on her. Get this thing if you have a clear shot on your barky dog next door.",dogs,3
"We received the Cat Charmer as a gift, and both of my cats adore it, but one in particular is completely obsessed with the thing! She'll sit outside of the closet we keep it in and meow, drag the thing around the house when we're not actively playing with it, and she can play with it for hours if I didn't get tired first. Highly recommended! It did eventually rip due to getting caught with her front claws a few times, so I'll have to buy a replacement so she's not too devastated.",cats,2

"I was desperate to get my white toy poodle's stained eyes to stay away. He was so cute except for these ugly stains around his eyes. He had stains so bad, kids on the street always asked me what was wrong with his eyes. I purchased different products but it was always a waste of money. I heard about different things from Tums to organic dog food to help it. Nothing worked. Cleaning the stains with peroxide on a Q-tip helped a little, but it made me so nervous.I was afraid it would get in his eyes. Finally we tried Angel eyes and it worked. He's been on it for a couple months and so far so good. I hope it doesn't stop working suddenly because he looks beautiful. His eyes are clear and stain free. I mix it in his food and he eats it with no problem. We tried a small bottle first and after good results we ordered the bigger bottle which winds up being more affordable. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to clear up those nasty stains from their white dog's eyes.",dogs,3
"Door is great, but could use a little bit more on the sealing...had to buy extra seal for the other side of door.

I love finding toys that challenge her and keeps her busy for a while without my arm having the toss something every 30 seconds. At first she didn't know what to think of it and got a little frustrated that she couldn't get to her treats, but after a few times with patience and encouragement from mommy, she turned to a pro! She plays with it so much and understands to stop tipping it over when all the treats are eaten. She got a little too good and now I have to dilute her treats with dry dog food. Best treats for this toy",dogs,3

"A stray cat adopted us after surviving last winter outside and on her own. She would never alllow us to get within 100 yards, until one day decided we were ""OK"". What a sweet animal. But a cat and inside the house is not an option, so we got this pad and placed it inside a wooden cat carrier in the garage. She loves being on this pad, and now we know where to find her. We have many coyotes so keeping her wandering to a minimum was a good thing. Great idea, great product so far - had it about 3 months now.",cats,2

"My cats were afraid of this when I first set it up, but adapted within a week and they loved it...It is not worth the hassle of cleaning however. The filter gets clogged and has to be replaced sooner than you would think. My guys eat and drink in the same area so I would find mushy food stuck in the filter and on the bottom. The top was also a pain to click into place, it seemed like I was searching for the right fit every time.Then...after 2 months, it just stopped working.I don't recommend this at all!",cats,2
"The old, small, beige model worked like a tank until the motor died. It was much better than scooping twice a day. I went through about 4 of them in a number of years but the newer model was a disappointment. The newer ones can barely push natural waste and frequently gets stuck halfway through. Littermaid sent me a new motor because I thought I may have bought a dud but the new one was junk, too. I'm out $120 and I'll never buy one again.",cats,2
"We have a yellow Lab who sheds year around to some degree. The Furminator has helped a great deal in controlling for the loose hairs that used to drop all over the house.

It is a tool that must be used carefully, however, as applying too much pressure when combing could irritate the skin.",cats,2

"I ordered this pretty much based on the reviews I read here. I needed a better litter box. I have two cats, one is 15 years old and getting a little sloppy - so a covered litter box was really needed. I HATED digging around in the litter box and would avoid it a few days, then would have to dump the whole thing.I don't dread this at all. I roll it in the evening and empty it, no rooting around in the filth. I wholeheartedly recommend this product. It may seem a little pricey at first, but you save on litter, time and disgust!",cats,2
"I purchased this item to fence in a six-month old puppy who weighs about forty pounds and is a calm-mannered sweetheart. I read reviews before purchasing, and while one stood out as alarming (the dog who was strangled in the gap at the door) the rest seemed fairly positive, and I knew I could adjust the height of the door to prevent it from being lifted up enough to squeeze a head into.I've worked construction before, and wasn't impressed with the quality of the chain link, which was already in a state of unraveling and had to be rewoven in places. I was even less confident in the metal ties provided to secure the chain link to the frame, and so after attaching them all at the recommended intervals (every five diamonds on the bottom) went through with security grade zip ties and secured in between all of those as well.Best estimates put it at fifteen minutes after I left, my dog escaped. The horrible quality chain link was a cinch for her to unravel and create a hole almost large enough to slip through unharmed. I say almost, even though she did slip through, because she sliced open a large gash about five millimeters from her eye. Fortunately, our backyard is fenced in, so she just hung out there all day until my wife got home, and is now recuperating with some neosporin.I want to send this back for a refund, but I'll need to wait until this weekend to disassemble it completely, and then since it weighs 165 pounds and is a giant awkward mess, it's going to be an enormous hassle to return. I'm extremely disappointed in this product. The other option would be to line the entire inside with chicken wire and cinder blocks, which is going to add a considerable additional expense to this already overpriced piece of junk.",dogs,3

"I am not sure how water proof this is but that is not an issue. I simply had to re-apply before the 30 days were up. I had to bathe a dirty dog about a week after the first application, within a few days the fleas re-appeared. It has been a week since the second application - no fleas yet.I first tried Spot On by Zodiac which I got at Pets-Mart. It was useless. I might as well have tried to beat the fleas to death with the ten dollars I paid for it. Every dog I have owned fought me tooth and nail if I tried to apply a spray/powder for fleas. They are nothing but instruments of dog torture.I think my flea problems have been solved - humanely.",dogs,3

All in all a great choice for a tie-out.",dogs,3
"My cat loves to play with this toy, both with and without me. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that he can only play with it for a certain amount of time before it starts to irritate his lips and gums. I don't know if that's a purely mechanical thing, or if there's something in the fabric he's sensitive to. He's also managed to chew off a piece of fabric at the end. So it's a nice toy, but not indestructible.",cats,2
"My cat thinks that he is a dog. I swear he does. He loves to chew things, including my furniture. I don't think I have any table, dresser, nightstand or any other piece of furniture that the cat does not chew on. Solution... this kitty tree. It is huge, and don't let the ""fur"" thing scare you. I was afraid it would be that cheap fur covering, but its not. It is a very thick nice fur that looks better than the rug covering you expect in cat houses. The cats love it. Both of my guys climb all over it. It is especially amusing to see the one cat who gets on the top of the second cat house layer where he can get to the rope and runs himself on circles while laying on his side.I've written to the seller and asked about replacement pieces since my guy is a chewer... waiting to hear on that but overall, we love it... the kitties love it, and it has saved my home!Good delivery, and a nice touch was the note from the seller. They do genuinely seem to care that you purchased from them. I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again. Do yourself and your kitties a favor and buy this one.",cats,2

"I bought the PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box from Amazon about 6 months ago. I loved how quiet it was and my cat didn't have any issues with it. I just didn't like the smell. The urine clumps would break up during the cleaning cycle and leave little bits of all over the clean litter. It started to stink pretty quickly. I only have one cat, he's a big one, but I didn't remember his litter ever smelling so bad. So, I went back and read the reviews on Amazon for this product. I remembered one guy saying that he plugged the litter box into a lamp timer. So, I went to the store and got a cheap timer that you plug your lights in to make it look like you're home when you're on vacation. I have it set to turn on the litter box 4 times a day for 1 hour. That took care of my smell problem. Now my only problem is remembering to empty the bin on a regular basis. It's so quiet I forget it is there.",cats,2

"[...]Well, I have had this product for about six months now and have actual experience, so read on [...]A friend gave me a couple of goldfish in one of those one-gallon jars that you'd see at a carnival. So although I knew this tank would be a little small, at least it would be better than that! Upon receiving this tank, I also purchased a few minnows and an algae-eater. Unlike the messages from the flood of PETA-esque negative reviews that have suddenly popped up, my fish have been in this tank for a while now, seem happy, and I haven't lost one yet. There has been no ammonia build-up... there has been no death-by-nitrates... the fish have shown no signs of stress, nor have they died from it.HOWEVER...1. The tank itself is made of plastic, not glass. So where they get the price tag on this is anybody's guess as there's no way that there was $120 worth of product and workmanship on this item (the glue stains on the side would attest to that).2. After a couple of months or so, the tank started to bow in the middle due to the fact that this cheap plastic is holding all of this water weight and eventually starts to buck under the pressure. This has been a MAJOR cause for concern as I'm not sure as to whether or not my tank is suddenly going to explode open and kill everything in it.3. There are two small rings in the middle that I can only suppose is there for giving the tank extra support. Therefore, I used some wire to connect these rings and essentially tie down the middle to prevent the bowing. Unfortunately, these rings are made of the same cheap plastic as the tank, so one ring broke within a week and now the tank bowes more than ever!4. The ACTUAL INTERNAL DIMENSION of the tank (just verified with a ruler) is 20 1/2 inches wide by 13 1/2 inches high by 2 1/2 inches deep! Granted the middle of my tank is now 3 1/2 inches deep, but that's only because it's BOWED IN THE MIDDLE BY NEARLY 50% from the pressure of making the mistake of putting water in it.5. The frame itself (which is what I guess the stated dimensions are based on) is also cheap plastic that you hang from the sides of the tank. You're supposed to snap these pieces into each other, but they don't quite fit both the tank and each other at the same time, so in the end, you have dangling plastic for effect.6. Plan on placing this close to an electrical outlet as the cords are very short and thick. This makes for unsightly huge white and black cords going down your walls (although we've simply painted the cords the same color as the wall as a solution).Bottom Line - We have cats that get at any other type of aquarium, so we figured that having one on the wall and out of their reach would be a nice compromise and if you have small enough fish (and not too many of them), then the dimensions should be fine (despite the cruelty-towards-animals comments below). HOWEVER, note that the actual aquarium dimensions are much smaller than what is advertised for the whole product and that, because it is made of plastic, even though it'll look fine, in six months you'll most likely find yourself in the same situation that I'm in now... out money and having to go get a different aquarium because of this junk.",fish aquatic pets,4

"These durable Nylabones seem to be somewhat less durable in the past couple years. I have an older Nylabone in the same flavor & size that my dog is still working at, and it's still in good shape. But I've purchased two more in the past year, in this and another flavor, and each time the pieces of plastic come away too easily & quickly. By 20 minutes into chewing, there are too many large pieces coming off, and I have to take it away. Swallowing this stuff is not good. I think Nylabone might be intentionally making these LESS durable so that we'll have to buy them more often, since the old ones lasted a lifetime.Also - note that this item is indeed the newer, textured version of the toy. I was hoping it wouldn't be, but I couldn't find it in this flavor and size in the untextured, and the description didn't mention it either way. My dog didn't seem to care either.As for all the Souper sized Nylabones, I wish they'd make the same thing just a bit longer in length. My dog is very tall but with a long narrow snout. He doesn't like anything that's too big to easily get in his mouth, like the ""big"" dog Nylabone toys.

"I've had this product for awhile, I wanted to wait to really put it to the test before I wrote a review. I trapped a feral barn cat this morning. She needed to be spayed, de-wormed, etc. When I went in the barn and saw the cat in the cage, she was not happy. She was hissing, spitting, rocking the cage, sticking her paws out as best she could to try and scratch me. Typical behavior of a feral cat who had never come into contact with humans. I had the cage covered with a towel. I sprayed this spray on the towel covering the cage, on the cage itself and I think I even got some on her. Within two minutes, this cat was quiet and somewhat calm. She still hissed a little when I was walking with the cage, but her behavior had dramatically improved. I then sprayed a little on the carpet floor of the car and I was able to drive this feral cat in the cage down to my local vet. She didn't make a sound and she hardly moved. I'm sure part of that was fear, but I have to believe the spray helped to keep her calm. If this spray can help to calm a feral barn cat, I think it could help with domesticated cats. And this brand is much cheaper than the typical brand you see in the vet office.",cats,2

He didn't try licking it off and seemed to enjoy me putting it on him",dogs,3
"I use one of these wipes about once a week on my cat (after a good brushing.) And later when the solution drys her coat is soft and there is no hair flying around her. I feel comfortable when she comes near to me.I purchased these wipes first in a Pet store at about $4.54 a package, but Amazon.com price is better.That label says it is safe for the cats. She does not seem to mind the solution and it does not bother her.",cats,2
"My two cats are both front declawed. This was great until I bought two leather chairs that the cats like to use as a spring board. I bought the soft paws for their rear claws. So far the first application has been on over 3 weeks. No more scratches on the chairs, and the cats don't even notice them - plus they are colored which is cute. One of my cats also spooks easily and has a history of shooting right off your lap or out of your arms when she hears an unexpected noise. This was a problem with our young daughter and she had been accidentally clawed a few times. With the soft paws, this is no longer an issue. You definitely don't want to get scratched by the same claws that dig around the litter box. The soft paws are great and I will definitely be keeping them on hand. No more pulled thread snags in the couch, scratches on the leather or accidental injuries to us. They are also easy to apply, and the thin applicator tip makes it easy not to use too much. Five stars for this product!p.s. My cats are a 9 pound female and 14 pound male. I use size medium for both their rear claws. Make sure you nip the tip of their claw with clippers before you apply the soft paws.",cats,2
This was a perfect fit for our 10 gallon aquarium. We've had no problems. It did take a couple of days of monitoring to get it at the right place and I had to readjust when a cold front moved through. It works as it says and isn't too much trouble.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I have a anxious cat that is very territorial. I also have children that come to visit and bring their dogs and cat. That is not a fun mix and Feliway helps calm the situation. I always use a diffuser both on my main level and lower level. Not a miracle, but a huge help.",cats,2

"This is the first time that I bought a laser toy for my cat, and what a surprise...she absolutely loves it. We played with it about 2 hours the first time while I was watching TV as well - you can multi-task. She actually went stalking the room when we finished, still looking for the moving red dot. The beam is strong and reaches very far, and I can get her moving all over the place. It's very good exercise for her, yet I can be a couch potato in my favorite chair after a busy work day and keep her entertained. She is 9 months old, so I highly recommend this for a young cat. If I find I am just under the free shipping threshold, I'll buy another one to get the free shipping and give it to someone as a gift.",cats,2
This collar has worked effectively in stopping my dog's barking. The collar is of poor quality - keeps slipping and getting bigger so I will have to replace it.,dogs,3
"I love dental wipes and my dogs prefer it to standard brushing. My oldest ""girl"" has very tender gums and is missing some teeth. Her gums bleed quite a bit so she resists brushing. When I use wipes she thinks I'm pampering her. I still brush as well, but this is a great easy alternative.",dogs,3
"We fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day. Some of the toys he loved, but this one scared him. The plastic is think and hard, so when he would roll it from side to side it made a loud noise from the impact on our hard floors.I think it would work better with carpeted homes. Also, it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out, so I would say this is an 'advanced' toy.",dogs,3
Sometimes now my cat prefers to use his litter box instead of going outside since the litter stays fresh and clean. No more handling cat poop! Nice!,cats,2
"My 10 month schnoodle (1/2 schnauzer, 1/2 poodle) loves this toy! It's just the right size for her to carry around (she's 17 pounds) and she loves to toss it and retrieve it as well. Sometimes she will go over to her toy basket and just nudge it to hear it talk. Her favorite thing is to smack it with her nose so that it goes careening around the tiled floor, talking to her the whole time, and she merrily chases it. Our cats also are curious about it (in a cautious way) and will stalk it and tentaively bat at it. Or course, once it starts talking, the puppy comes running, and then the cats run for cover! Good times!",dogs,3

When you have a ton of dogs in your home the bigger the bag the better!! I was not expecting the bag to be so HUGE! I am VERY HAPPY!! They will be great for my many kids and they are great for the tiny pups too since they are only about the size of a nickle each! GREAT for training treats and at just 3 calories each they are even great for my few little fatties who are trying to shed a few extra pounds.,dogs,3

"This has really been a life saver for me. I have two dogs. one is an English Setter with long hair on his paws, and it does a great job of cleaning them! My Jack is too little to get into it.The trick is to train them to be still while you dip their paws in the unit. I dip, squeeze the excess water from his paw and have the towel ready to dry, and he is such a good boy that he even turns around and lifts his back legs up for me..BUT...!I can totally see the reviews in regards to it being too heavy and hard to use, because it really is! My wife and sister (when she watches the dogs) will not use it, they both say that it is too heavy and cumbersome for them. I just muscle through it and call it good.I have since took the idea and made my own, lighter and smaller version that will work for my Jack Russell as well.GREAT!!! idea, just needs some tweaking. If you don't mind a little work it really is better then standing there for 10 mins cleaning mud from between their toes when this does it in a few secs. In the summer it doesn't get used because the garden hose is WAY easier.Hope this helps!",dogs,3

"I have a 10 gallon tank that I had been having trouble with. Too much algae and the filter I had clogged a lot. After shopping around, I stumbled on this. It seemed to be what I was needing so I got it. My first impression was that this thing is huge compared to my tank. I thought it was going to be too powerful and push my fish around. Still, I installed it hoping that it would all work out. After it was installed, it took a little finagling to find the exact position I wanted for it.It has now been installed for six weeks. My tank is much cleaner and I have had no trouble with the filter. While it is really powerful, it doesn't seem to bother my fish too much. In fact most days, I can find one of my clownfish playing in the stream. One of the things that I like most about it is that I will be able to use it if I decide to upgrade my tank to a larger one (the place I currently live is restricting me to 10g). This is quite a good filter and will be in use for several years for me.",fish aquatic pets,4
"We have a very active Bloodhound puppy and were worried she would damage the seats in our truck. Most seat covers only protect the rear seat and dogs frequently try to jump up on the back of the front seat. The hammock is easy to install and remove and protects both seats. Also, it permits our puppy to enjoy the ride without being constrained. Great product!",dogs,3
"I only gave 4 stars because the lid doesn't catch and latch to stay on so I wouldn't try to ever carry mine by the handle. My cat is pretty petite and it fits her well, if I had a bigger cat I would think it might be bordering on being too small. The colors are pleasing though and the litter pan is nice and deep and obviously it functions and serves its purpose.",cats,2

"Timothy Complete is an excellent food for adult rabbits. Adult rabbits should not have alfalfa as a main ingredient in their pellets, the protein level is too high. When I switched my rabbits from an alfalfa based diet to Timothy Complete at the suggestion of my vet, my mini-lop no longer had messy poops! The vet told me the high levels of protein in alfalfa caused the digestive upset.Remember to also give your rabbit unlimited access to Timothy hay and fresh vegtables each day.",small animals,5
I bought this filter for a 55 gal. tank. I much prefer this filter over other filters that you have to buy new filtering medium every time you change the filter. I put the sponge on the top instead of the bottom so it is easy to take out and wash. My tank is much clearer than with the AquaTech I had been using. It runs very quietly. My only COMPLAINT is that it said to wash the charcoal bag before putting it in the filter and the charcoal was so fine half of it washed out before the water ran clear. I'll definitely have to rig my own charcoal bag to replace it. The little doodad that is supposed to level the filter is iffy but it works. Make sure you put it on in the step listed on the paper or you'll have trouble getting it on. Especially if you don't have extra space between your wall and the filter. Even with these minor drawbacks I would not hesitate to buy another because it works very well and is so easy to wash the filter sponge.,fish aquatic pets,4
"This product worked spectacularly well in my house with 6 cats in 2400 sq feet. With two males (neutered) and four females (not spaded) we have had constant problems over the past three years with cats spraying areas to establish territoriality.We have 10 litter boxes scattered about with 3 or 4 different types of litter (more than the n+1 rule), but this hasn't eliminated the problem. I've tried isolating cats with their own litter box, and although this helps it also didn't solve the problem.About three weeks ago we installed 6 diffusers throughout the house -- particularly in areas where the cats constantly soiled. The result was almost immediate. They stopped urinating outside of the litter boxes. In only one instance has a cat urinated, and that was in a room we normally have as a cat free zone.The problems caused by having the second male cat hasn't disappeared. He is socially immature and tends to attack the other cats, but the stress levels for the cats have gone down.I wish we had known about this product sooner. Other than its cost, which is a problem, Felliway does what it claims and I will be using it from now on and am an enthusiastic endorser.",cats,2
This has lots of room to store your pets stuff when travelling with him and it keeps him safe during the car ride. The fact that the car seat becomes a bed too is extremely convenient when going for a night or more away from home. Also it's easy to put into the car.,dogs,3

"These are apparently a slightly updated version of some Solvit steps that I've had for at least five years at the foot of my bed. I ""promoted"" that set to use with my new compact SUV that replaced a station wagon with a much lower step-up. That meant I needed something new for the foot of the bed. Since they're identical for all practical purposes, these work perfectly.These are for larger dogs but I can see where small dogs in good health could use them with no problem. They are about the same height as regular human stairs, so if your pet is too small or too infirm to use steps of that size, these are probably not for you. If your dog can use stairs in your house and weighs less than 250#, these will work.I noticed that my two dogs were reluctant to use the old steps to get in the new car, even though they were perfectly happy using them to get on the bed. I think it's because anything at all new to a dog is all-new, so my exhortations of ""oh come on Buford, they're the same steps!!"" didn't work. Expect to spend some time training and acclimating your pet(s) whether you're trying to get them in a bed, porch, car, couch, camper, whatever.These are very durable, sturdy and stable...you'd have to try hard to damage them. Mine arrived after an Amazon-advised ""unexpected delay beyond our control"" via UPS in a box that had been punctured on two sides, crushed at the top and taped back together. The steps were perfect. They come completely assembled and ready for use. Another reviewer thought that was a bad thing and I am still scratching my head over that.One minor complaint",dogs,3

"This product is amazing. I really researched this before buying after having been burnt by the littermaid that I had struggled with for a year. This box actually lives up to its reviews. My 2 cats took to it right away. The first disposible box lasted 12 days with just my scooping out the solid stuff every 3 days or so. I now am using the forever tray and so far, so good. The best features of this are that it requires TRUELY almost no upkeep. You can really set it and forget it for a few days. The littermaid was constantly needing to be unjammed. I could never go even one day without scooping or troubleshooting it. Also, this scoop free really really keeps the box clean. Cleaning the littermaid was a major ordeal with all the parts and it being so heavy. One of the advantages to an automatic box is that the kitties should always have a clean box and that certainly wasn't the case with the littermaid.If the crystals are a bit more expensive than litter, it is a small price to pay for an almost work free litter box. I do wish the crystals were more widely available but having them delivered either through Amazon or Scoopfree is am easy option. I love, love, love this box!!",cats,2
"I received these really fast and boy did I set them right up and got rid of the others that did not have a lid. I get less litter all around them. They look nice and I just might have to order one more. I had 5 cats in the house, now I will only have my four. I was cat sitting for my sons cats. I had to take off the front door to them, I will see if they will use it with one of them on. For the price they are great..",cats,2

"This is definitely a ""buyer beware"" item. As pictured (burgandy with carrying handles), it is the 16"" (smallest) model. we needed a 24"" carrier with handles. When we clicked on the item, and selected the size, we did not notice that the handles disappeared from the picture of the item we were buying. In addition, the color changed from burgandy to tan. The carrying handles are only available on the smallest model. Definitely deceptive. If you don't notice it, there's nothing you can do once you open the package. Since we had to open it to put it together, and then discover the lack of carrying handles (and th ecolor change), we cannot return the product according to Amazon's buying policy. We just spent $40 on a crate that can't be easily transported......However, it appears to be well constructed, and roomy enough....it's just not foing to fufill the purpose for which we bought it. Be careful, and watch out for changing item pictures!",dogs,3
"We use our leashes several times a day for our dogs and they last for years. The nylon cord is very durable and we have never had one wear through or break. Eventually, after many thousands of extensions and retractions, the spring might break inside like ours did. If you felt inclined to repair it yourself or send it off for repair, you could probably do it. We opted to buy new ones and have no complaints. I have seen imitations, but the snap and overall construction looked inferior, so be sure you are getting a Flexi and you won't regret it.",dogs,3
"Our new puppy is 12 weeks so I used this in his crate at night to help him settle without his littermates. The second time I used it he quickly bit open the toy and the sack of grains inside, spilling them all over his bedding. Hoping he did not ingest them- glad I have a vet appt. today. Our pup is not a destructive chewer and is not teething either. Do not give this toy to a young puppy- much safer to let him adjust on his own. Also did not stay warm long and is very small- much smaller than he is at 12 weeks old. I wish I still had the box as I would return it immediately. What a terrible idea.",dogs,3
"I bought this in January 2012 to replace our Littermaid automatic litter box.I feel this is superior to the Littermaid box I had because:- Much quieter... doesn't have the noisy engine cranking away- The waste collection has greater capacity.

This product is great and is as described except that it is a little small for my 8 pound Bichon/Poodle puppy. He fits in it nicely now but still has some growing to do.

She wouldn't go into an igloo or anything she couldn't see out of. She spends the winter on my deck but out of the elements. It heats up when she is sitting on it, so you don't waste a lot of electricity. I had purchased this before but it only worked for two winters.

"My cat loves to chase lasers around, it's actually the only toy she'll play with. I have a hand held one that she loves to chase around, if I even move it she'll come running from wherever she is in the house.This one sucks, all it does is rotate around in a continuous oval pattern, at a speed that makes it look almost like a solid line instead of a pointer. It moves too fast for the cat to stay interested in, and it does the exact same pattern over and over again, stopping once in awhile. If you put it up higher, then you can get a larger pattern, but it still goes around too fast for the cat to stay interested in. This toy was a waste of money. The only time my cat wants to play with it, is when it stops at certain points, then she'll run to that spot, but then it is gone before she can get interested, just when it catches her interest it starts spinning too fast for her to see a pointer, and it is back to almost a solid line again. I would look at the Frolicat bowling pin shaped one, from what I see in the video it seems to move slower and more randomly. It is a little more expensive, but when you consider your cat won't play with this one, then it is cheaper. I am going to try to return this one to Petco, and get the Frolicat one.",cats,2
"This is the first time I have been moved to review anything, but I am thrilled with this product. I wanted a ball that I could throw and bounce, as well as withstand being chewed on by my 110# lab, and I finally found it. Until now, balls that would bounce could be punctured and finally torn to pieces; balls that were indestructible were solid rubber and too heavy to throw and bounce. My dog has had two of these Orka balls for several months now, and they are both still in one piece and bounce like they did when they were new. The only problem I see is for the manufacturer - I don't have to buy new balls very often!",dogs,3

This is a great product for anyone with a small dog or cat for access to water when they need it and fresh. I use filtered water from my refrig & the bottle has a small neck that fits.

"When I bought this, I believe Amazon had surplus of discontinued products, so I got it for around $36 including shipping/handling. Hence my comment ""Economical"". Normally doggy door like this (size/material) costs you near $100.This product works really well with my dogs (boxer and mutt), but the petsafe logo on the flap deposits dirt since the dogs go through it all the time.In addition, I haven't been able to find replacement flap in case this one goes bad. Replacing the flap would also involve uninstalling the door, which is a bit of a hassle.Overall the aluminum frame looks good and strong, but the cover is plastic which was disappointing. The frame itself is actually pretty strong and especially would work well once installed and fit into a door, but the screws are also plastic, so I had to buy metal screws myself.",dogs,3
My dog absolutely loves this toy!! I bought him the $10 version at petsmart. It looks minature compared to this one. For an 80lb german shepard this toy fits his size perfectly. He's had the toy for a little over a week and is semi rough with it and it looks almost brand new.,dogs,3
"This is truly a great product. We have bred Rottweilers from quite sometime; however, we decided to add a Mastiff to our family. She is a crier, screamer, etc! For the first 3 days after we got her home, she screamed so much that we contemplated returning her. We were truly at wits end. We have never, in all of our years of breeding, had a dog like her. Then, I remembered from my days as an Operations Manager at Petsmart that they made products with heartbeats in them. I searched every chain and local pet store; no one sold anything like it anymore. I went on to Amazon, and there they were. I paid for next day shipping (my regular 2 day was NOT going to cut it). I set it up, placed it in her cage, and she immediately stopped crying. For the first time since we got her, she slept through the night. I have been contemplating whether I should add this to my puppy sales packs.It included:1. Snuggle Puppy Animal2. 2 sets of batteries (each set last about three days if you leave it on constantly)3. 2 24 heat packs.It only takes a second (with a Phillips screw driver) to set up. The stuffed Snuggle Puppy does tend to get a little smelly; however, you just remove the heart and pop it in the washing machine. No muss, no fuss. After several washes, the Velcro that keeps the ""heart"" inside the Snuggle puppy was completely worn. I decided to buy another puppy. I have also gone to JoAnn and replaced the velcro. It took me a couple of bucks and a little (very little) sewing know-how. Now, we have two. I can wash one, and she has another. This way, she is never without.My only concern is that she is addicted to it. She HAS to sleep with it (she is only 3 months now; however, as a mastiff, she is quite large). When she is sitting in her cage, she sits on snuggle puppy. When she is sleeping, she sleeps on snuggle puppy. I am hoping that, with age, she will become less dependent on him for comfort. In the interim, I don't know what we would have done without him.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WITH A PUPPY WHO IS HAVING A HARD TIME SEPARATING FROM THEIR LITTER/GOING THROUGH CRATE TRAINING/HAS SEPARATION ANXIETY ISSUES!",dogs,3

"We've been using this for about 6 months now. It sure beats a shovel, clamp type scoop, or the 'hand and glove/bag' method. But there are a few caveats. What you can't see from the picture is that each of those thick wires end in blunt tines. They are rather long too. Those ends get snagged in the grass quite frequently. Now, we live in Florida and the grass here is more like a weed with lots of low growing off-shoots that criss-cross rather than the beautiful carpet like grass that grows elsewhere. So with normal grass that's kept short it may not be so much of a problem. With the type of grass we have, it is. After 6 months it's a little bent out of shape from snagging and then having to be pulled out-- which also sometimes results in poop chunks flying. Yuck. The only other problem we've had with it is occasionally the small bits fall through the wires. Our dog is about 17 lbs so not huge but not a mini-mini either. It would be perfect for a medium to large dog in a sandy yard :) Anything outside of that takes a little finessing. I'd still rather use this than anything else that's available, just not quite perfect. And it stays pretty clean too; not much there to get gunked up.",dogs,3
"I purchased this because Ive been supplementing my dog's diet with coconut oil & thought this might be a good way to change it up. The stuff smells horrible. Like horrible horrible. But the worst part was when my poor dog woke up with hives and a super swollen face. She had a terrible allergic reaction to the Salmon Oil which required an emergency trip to the vet. The poor pooch looked like Mike Tyson. She got a couple of shots and is now sleeping it off, but wow--I would never have guessed something so innocuous could have lead to such a reaction.

"This pet crate has an odd name considering its complete lack of interface with any Apple product I have ever encountered.I bought this cage to transport my dog (of unknown parentage; 30&#34; long x 18&#34; tall) in the trunk of my medium-size SUV. The crate takes up a lot of cargo space, and has ample room for my dog. Midwest's next smaller crate would likely have been adequate, but I'd rather Alfie traveled First rather than Economy if you get what I mean.Assembly is simple, the side and roof sections fold out and up, and are secured by clips. The floor is a sturdy plastic pan, and two doors gives me options as to how I orientate the cage in my car. Dis-assembly is likewise simple and makes storage easy.The doors rattle quite a lot - may not bother some but it does me, so I have to wedge them to keep it quiet.

"We've been using ours for 8 months now and it stops cats from coming into our yard near our back wall. That is, until the batteries run out once a month. The sign that the batteries have run out is usually seeing a cat in our yard. I wish it had its own low battery indicator.",cats,2
"these are a good idea, just read the fine print first, even though our couch was treated, we were still able to put them on, I just wish I saw this before buying it. Also, my cats ate it! Seems they love it, and even thought it is really sticky and would work for most cats, I have one cat with pica, and she loves anything plastic. Just never thought she would eat this. Another one of my cats, who is not known for eating weird stuff, was licking it! I a surprised his tongue did not stick!",cats,2
"catit; Drinking Fountain and Accessories for CatsThis fountain is GREAT! I have two cats, one was diagnosed with bladder stones shortly after I got the second one. The vet said I needed to add salt to the cat food and make water available. Well, it's really hard to get a cat to drink more, but this fountain did it! Both cats can drink out of it, so there is no competition issues, it is really easy to clean, (I clean it once a month), when it makes noises you just add more water to the basin, not the dome. I've seen no mold, and the filter catches all the cat hair (which is minimal). I have two short haired cats, but I guess if you have long haired ones clogging may be more of a problem. The motor still works and I've had the fountain for almost a year now. Is is really easy to set up and even though I put the fountain on carpet you just have to tilt the dome to ensure good water coverage and then the water flow takes care of itself. Great product!",cats,2
"My 12-yr-old cat has been indoors since age 6 wks. His mom was feral. He never did adapt well, & would hide or run when anyone approached. Even me, the feeder, if I didn't do it right.He got worse after hurricane Katrina, and spent about 6 months wedged behind a bookcase. Any loud noise or unfamiliar person would send him scurrying.About a month ago, I saw a program on telly that featured a cat much like mine. The ""therapist"" advised the owners to use a pheromone spray on themselves and to spritz the legs or feet of guests. When the ""therapist"" revisited, the cat was calmer.Well, it seemed worth a shot. I ordered the diffuser, since that seemed more polite than spraying down guests.I saw results in about 8 days. The cat began staying in plain sight more, and would jump on the sofa, and even asked to be petted. He also began grooming more.The acid test was when he didn't scurry when my husband entered the room. That was revolutionary.This is a product that I'll continue to use.",cats,2

"I have a friend who has a Littermaid, and has had no problems with it, but mine broke within a couple days. However, I did buy mine used from a yard sale, so that could be part of it. It worked fine at first. One of my cats likes to use the litter box right on the edge of the box, and the Littermaid doesn't clean that area very well. My other cat digs A LOT in the litterbox. Whenever he went, he would pile up all the litter in one big pile. I think that's what killed the motor. He also was used to more litter than what you're required to use for the Littermaid. He likes to dig deep. I have a CatGenie now, and I absolutely LOVE it. I know it's much more expensive than the Littermaid, but it's worth it for me. At least consider the CatGenie before buying a Littermaid.",cats,2

"I have used this product multiple times to start quarantine tanks and hospital tanks (marine tanks, with both fish and coral.) It works; it's worked every time. I've never had my tanks spike ammonia or nitrite when using this product as directed. I'm amazed how many websites & forums claim that no such product exists. Also, the reviewer who says that you have to keep using it is wrong, for so many reasons (the bacteria don't get used up and die, they multiply, just like all bacteria, and also, all of the bacteria that would normally be in your tank if you cycle the traditional way will also still exist in the tank.) I've never used the product beyond 7 days, not even with water changes, and my tanks have never ""crashed"" when I stopped using this. I would, however, consider stocking the tank lightly, and gradually building up stock.",fish aquatic pets,4

In the past, the only toys I gave her when totally unsupervised were KONG toys. This product is definitely not nearly as durable as their other items. Unless your dog is a very gentle chewer, this is NOT a safe item. I have never had a problem with a KONG product before, but I DO NOT recommend this item.",dogs,3

"I have been working with cats for over 40 years and run a boarding and rescue kennel. If you're looking for the toy to exercise that hyper-active cat, or pique the curiosity of the bored cat, or just want your cat to have a great time, stock up on ""Da Bird""...just be careful not to get them too excited near furniture with sharp corners because they have so much fun leaping into the air to catch it they forget to see where they will land!!! Play safe and get the original! Sometimes they don't twirl just right, but get several and examine the position of the feathers of the ones that sound and look like a bird in flight and then just tweak the ones that don't do it perfectly. I have used 'da bird' for cat therapy of pacing cats by giving them daily exercise/play for 10 minutes in am and 15 minutes in pm to relieve extreme boredom of cats that are actually overly intelligent and pace and and cry. Nothing works better than da bird! THey ALWAYS want to play with it! There is no substitute...the others just haven't figured out the secret of 'da bird.'",cats,2

"We have had this window perch for over a year, and really love it. Our cat uses it every day. It is sturdy enough for my almost 2 year old son to stand on, and is easy to install. The only fault with it is the metal tabs that hook over the bottom of the inside of the window prevent the window from closing all the way. There's no gap, there just isn't a tight seal so there's a small draft. It may not be this way on all windows, but it is on ours. I'm sure there's an easy work around I haven't thought of, but we just live with it and enjoy it anyway. The color and carpeting are also nice and blend in with our wall color perfectly.

Consistent size does matter with doggies. these are about three bucks each. Petsmart has ones that are more than double the size right now for 2.50 each on sale and they are only 3.50 each regular price. i wont be buying these again.",dogs,3

"This product is driving me insane. I purchased it for my tree frog terrarium, which is half land and half water. After the first week of use the propeller broke and I had to order a replacement. A few months later, the propeller broke again and the motor head stopped functioning at the same time. This is the last time I am ordering replacement parts for this thing! When it is functioning it makes a huge difference compared to the submersible pump I used to have that did not filter anything, as those burned out monthly and were constantly clogged. The water is clear and clean and this filter has not clogged once. I don't recommend it for terrariums that don't have deep water, as every time the water level drops it seems to die on me - though I have no idea what a better alternative may be.

"I normally feed my three goldfish pellets or flakes, the most commonly available food in my town without a pet food store. I purchased the Tetra crisps on a whim, but I've found that this product works great and my fish love it, too. Not that they're picky or anything. The product prides itself on leading to a cleaner tank and less mess. It's right on one point - there really is less mess in pouring these in and feeding them, and unlike the flakes, I don't find them in my filter later or coating the sides of the tank. The tank, though, is still as dirty as ever, but I can't really complain about this product. The fish love it, the bottle makes feeding easy, and I don't have to pick out leftovers. I'd definitely recommend this product to goldfish owners, but don't expect it to really do much in the cleaner water department.",fish aquatic pets,4

But mostly, i'm just disappointed at my own oversight hence 3 stars rather than 2.The larger one is very nice though especially since it is shipped directly from amazon.com and if you're like me with the amazon prime account, shipping is free so for the same price (about $8), you can either get this tiny choke toy, or a bigger one (approx 3x8in).",dogs,3
"Great car seat for our chihuahua. This safe booster seat means that our dog is secure if we stop suddenly or go around a sharp corner, he will not fly into the dashboard or off the seat. The good height of the seat means that pup can have his back window down and get some fast air in his face!I nearly gave this product five stars except for two design aspects. Firstly, the back seat must have a proper headrest, not a moulded one on the seat. So this booster seat works in my husbands car but not mine. Secondly, the clasp for the collar is a plastic clip. I think a carabiner clip would be pretty brilliant, but I can easily pop one on mine for ease of clipping in.Dog is happy in seat and has only tried to get out once. This rendered him sitting comfortably next to the booster on the back seat, no strangulation or discomfort and still secure.",dogs,3

The size was good but within 10 minutes of having it she had torn off almost all of the ribbons and it was warm to the touch. I returned it and would not recommend this product for any puppy. It would be better if it stayed cold longer and the ribbons were not on it since they are pretty easy to tear off and chew up as my puppy demonstrated.,dogs,3

"This is our third ring in four years for our very energetic vizsla. She loves this toy and plays with it everyday, and thus it gets a lot of wear and tear. For a cloth toy, it does fantastic and I am amazed that it lasts a little over a year each time with the amount of play that it has. We even do tug of war with it. I will admit that the sqeakers pop pretty soon after we get it, but frankly, they all do, so I cannot give it less stars for that fault. I highly recommend this Tuffy ring.",dogs,3
This floppy disc is the best frisbee we've ever had! It's easy to throw and easy for our dog to catch. We love it!,dogs,3
"I doubt there is a cat out there that would not be interested in this toy. In fact, we found out the hard way that if you leave the toy out, it will be destroyed. One of my cats must think it's a real bird so she will kick and scratch and bite it to pull off and eat the feathers, so we have to keep it out of reach when not in use. I'd give it 5 stars if they were built a little bit stronger. I'm only giving 3 stars because we've gone through so many of these that it is no longer an option to purchase more. When one of my cats catches it in mid air, in a split second she can break and shred it. She's unbelievable with this toy and appears to be a total hunting machine. If I let her outside there wouldn't be a bird or squirrel around for miles. So, anyway, I wish these feather toys were made to last. Unfortunately, the toy is incredible but just not very durable if you have a cat that plays hard. On the other hand, I have a cat that loves to play with the toy and she does not try to destroy it if she catches it, so it really just depends on the voraciousness of your cat.",cats,2
"I got this litter box because I hate cleaning the litter boxes, but I didn't want to drop $300 on a more expensive self-cleaning box. I have 3 cats and always had two litter boxes, one of which always leaked (even when I replaced it). Anyway, I usually scooped once a week, and it was such a chore! So I bought this and got rid of my two regular boxes. So far, so good! It's ingeniously designed (there's a grate so when you roll it to the right [and you do have to roll it practically upside down], the litter goes into a reservoir and the clumps spill over the top of the grate and into the drawer; when you straighten it out and tip it slightly to the left, the litter goes back through the grate and into the pan). Usually some clumps are left after a rotation, but generally speaking, it's super easy to roll the box and empty the drawer. I do it once or twice a day because it's so easy, which means my house smells way better than usual (since before I was only scooping once a week or so). In short, I recommend this litter box!",cats,2
"At the recommendation 7 years ago by our dog trainer, we started using the Natural Life dog food. Our dogs have never been overweight and their coats and health have been excellent.

"My mother got this for my husband as a birthday gift because he hated cleaning the old litterbox (non-automatic type, he had to take over when I got pregnant). It has been a huge blessing! The cat started using it with no fuss, it requires no special bags and as long as you clean it regularly (a piece of cake!) there is no odor!There is a very low constant hum from the engine, I've heard florescent lights buzz louder. Across the room you can barely hear it, we have it in a back room and never hear it at all. Also, I think some litter got into a nook or cranny somewhere because after the first week it started making an occasional vibrating noise. As soon as I have the baby I'll take the litterbox apart and clean it thoroughly, I'm sure that will take care of it.Overall, we are very thrilled with this gift.",cats,2

"We have 2 inside cats at our house, a male and a female. We have an older female cat that doesn't get along with other females, so when this female stray showed up at our house, we tried to find another home for it. When those efforts failed and with cold weather on the way, we decided to make a home for her in our garage. After installing a pet door, using this mat, we made her a heated bed. In addition to the mat, we use a 75-wat incandescent bulb to warm the space above the bed. We keep food and water out there for her as well (in addition to getting her spayed and immunized). Despite the manufactures warning about placing blankets directly on the mat, we do cover the mat with a thin blanket and see no issues with doing so. The mat does a good job of warming the bed and the cat uses the bed daily. She's a really nice cat and when our older inside female decides to go to cat heaven, we will surely bring her into the house.",bunny rabbit central,1

As a renter, I didn't know what kind of a door I had. I called PetSafe and a rep asked me a few questions and told me I had a Freedom door. I found one locally, which looked like it would be perfect -- it wasn't.I called one more time and this rep asked me several more questions, including if the screws at the top of my plastic frame door were evenly spaced and if the panel to close off the door slid down from the top (and if my door was flexible, not rigid). I answered yes to all her questions and was told I have a Quick Fit door. UGH. If I had this to do over again, I would call the company and describe the door in detail BEFORE making any purchase for a replacement flap. Hopefully three will be a charm.

Between this shampoo, Frontline earlier in the battle, flea traps, and a lot of vacuuming and washing I think we're starting to take the upper hand.

Local stores do not carry these products and as a result the integrity of the system (in other words keeping the dogs inside the fence) fails if the dogs are continually testing and looking for ways to escape.,dogs,3

"This product was recommended when I adopted my dog. I had been buying it at a local pet-supply shop that had only one size package.

The product works well for us and paying less is always popular.",dogs,3
"If you're looking for a ""no-noise"" filter, I recommend buying a hang-on-back type filter. This canister filter is strong, the motor hums pretty loudly. Been using for 6 months now on a 60 gallon tank with 40 African Cichlids, even with an Aqua Clear 50 as a secondary filter, the xP3 needs bi-weekly cleaning. I have sand substrate and live plants so there is a lot going on. I have to clean it every other week now, the first 3 months it was working flawless without any cleaning. I guess it's time to replace all the media, they're pretty expensive! For the price, it is not worth it! I could have bought 5 x AquaClear 50 and they would have done a way better job!!!",fish aquatic pets,4
"I have a second story deck that we had just remodeled and purchased new furniture for. Some feral cats in our area decided they like the custom made cushions on the furnite. After trying several methods to deter them, I ordered the CatStop. There has not been a cat on my furniture since. I placed the device under the stairs and for the first few days, the cats were scared away when they tried to climb the steps. Since then, they have not been around. Thanks for a great device!",cats,2

Our kitty needs to loose some pounds but she is very reluctant to play alone. But once I bought this toy I can hear her playing it several times during night.

"I have a Jack Russell and she was through playing with this toy in a matter of minutes. In that short time she was able to break the squeaker and lost all interest in the toy.

"I work 12 hour shifts and my room mate works 9 hours, and together we have 3 cats. I've always tried to keep to a daily schedule of cleaning the box to keep our place fresh, but after a really long shift during the summer, coming home to a house with 3 cats and one litter box in 90-degree heat and 70% humidity was getting old fast. Then my room mate received this self cleaning litter box in the mail. I was skeptical but hopeful that it would work as easily as it said it would.Soon enough, the 3 monsters had given the new cat box plenty of material for its debut test run, and sure enough it worked exactly as the manufacturer claimed it would; I shook the cat box a little first, just to break up the litter, rolled it over in one quick motion, held it almost upside down, tapped the bottom a couple times with my free hand, and rolled it back. I pulled out the drawer and emptied it into a supermarket plastic shopping bag (which are the best because they're free!), and threw it in the trash. Easiest way to clean a litter box I can imagine; its simplicity is what makes it so great. Believe me, this product will not disappoint you, especially if you have multiple cats to clean up after.",cats,2

"After going through 4 of the rake-type automatic litter boxes (DON'T EVER BUY ONE) in less than two years, I decided to try the Litter Robot. I should have done it two years ago and saved myself a lot of money and frustration!To give you some specifics, we are a 5 cat (adults) household, males & females (all neutered), ranging from 6 to 15 pounds. They all took to it with very little or no trouble at all.This is a GREAT product! It requires hardly any attention, uses clumping type litter and can be left On or Off. In the On setting, it cycles approximately 7-10 minutes after the cat leaves it. If you wish to keep it in the Off setting, you can switch it On for immediate cycling or ""Flushing"". The cycling noise is fairly minimal, kind of a loud hum, but if you are a light sleeper, you can switch it off at night and then turn it on first thing in the morning for immediate ""flushing"".Although the manufacturer recommends using plastic wastebasket bags, it isn't necessary. I use the plastic bags from the grocery store, WalMart, etc., and just cut them a bit at the seams.The only complaint I have about the unit is my own fault! Since the thing works so well and any smell is pretty much undetectable, I have, on more than one occasion, forgotten to empty the collection drawer in a timely manner... Yikes!My only suggestion to improve the product would be to add another rubber grommet to secure the bag at the front of the drawer, but even without one, I am still ordering a second unit for the house.Lastly, the customer service people at Litter Robot are amazing! They immediately respond to inquiries and sincerely care about their customers.Cat Lovers!! Step away from your hand-scoop or rake type litter boxes and order a Litter Robot immediately! Once you see it in action, you'll slap yourself for not doing it sooner!",cats,2

"This litterbox took some experimentation at first. Don't fill with litter above the fill line - it actually works better if it is a little low.I re-use the receptables and have no problem with the odor. A little baking soda in the litter box tray is helpful if it gets a little strong. As needed you should empty the raked litter and start with a clean, fresh box. This averages about once a month for us (three cats with an accessible backyard). Sometimes the cats come running in from outdoors to use it.I keep a screwdriver by the litterbox to flick through the rake and remove any fecal matter that sticks to the teeth. A putty scraper works great for occasionally scraping the bottom clean.I work odd shifts, and to keep the litterbox from waking us up every so often, I put a timer on the box plug-in. It only operates about 10 hours a day, and doesn't get used so heavily that it plugs up. If you had heavy cat use, you would need to have it run more hours, or set for intermittent operation.With a standard litterbox, we were cleaning two or three times a day just to keep the box decent. I empty the Littermaid receptacle once a week, right before garbage day. We use clumping litter from a wholesale store. Experimentation with various litters produced no significant difference in cleanliness, efficiency, etc.There will be occasional fecal balls that evade capture. You can scoop them or ignore them; they'll eventually be gone. We also put a Rubbermaid lid from an underbed box beneath the Littermaid, as it is in a carpeted room, and there was a lot of litter scatter. The ramp is worthless; we don't use it. They jump over the side instead of wiping their feet on the matting. There's still some litter in the rug, but most of it gets caught in the lid.",cats,2

I picked Merrick because my dogs are SO picky and they absolutely LOVE this! Its like crack to them, they freak out! Its like they think its human food(which is great!). I think the price is fair too, 5.99 for shipping and less than $30 for a 15lb of dog food, thats a great deal!

This is what was needed. The only thing is that my furry baby thinks it is a monster!

But his food is still pretty fresh in the container.

This log has some nice, realistic detail and color and I really like the large hole in the side and top of the log, too. I was a little worried that it would look too big in my tank (even knowing the measurements in advance, I was surprised at the size when I opened the package!), but it is a perfect fit in my 23""x26""x25"" bowfront cube.

This 4 in 1 collar allows for vibration, shock, sound, and vibration before shock feature. The estimate arrival date was May 20th and I received it on May 1st. We have not tried letting the dog loose with the collar but from all indications this experience should go well as the vibration seems to be enough.

"First I should say that if this stuff really works, then it is a godsend. A vet told me I should brush my cat's teeth daily, and I tried it a couple of times. That was enough. I was glad I had had the foresight to don a long-sleeved jacket first.So I got this powder in hopes that it would do what my brushing technique could not. I sprinkled a tiny bit on Goofball's food, and he reluctantly ate some of it, but experiments with two bowls demonstrated that he really didn't like it. He has to get pretty hungry before he'll eat food even lightly dusted with this stuff. We never got anywhere near the recommended dose.Goofball is kind of a picky eater, so I can't fault the product too much, but it didn't really work for us. I have neighbors with dogs -- perhaps they'll like it.",cats,2

"This product works wonders. I have two maltese, both of which have extremely bad tear stains. My two year old maltese had a clean white face when we bought him, but after only a few days, ugly brown stains showed up on his face. I tried Eye Envy (you had to actually clean their face with some herbal smelling green liquid, then put powder on their face) but that was too much work with very little change. I used tear stain cleaners from PetCo etc. but those only helped lighten the tear stains, and only after you washed their face. Leave it alone for a few days and they were back. Finally, after endless searching, I found the website for Angels' Eyes and decided to try it. It is a powder that you just sprinkle on their food (I use it with soft food) and it WORKS! Just after three days, I noticed a change. Now, both of my dogs are tear stain free, and after a while, you can start lowering the dosage so you don't go through so many bottles. It is a bit pricey, but the price I found here was a deal. About $40 for a 120 gram bottle... cheapest I've found for such a great product.Note",dogs,3

"I received this item very quickly which I was super happy about, but putting it together was a whole different story. First, you definitely need 2 people to assemble this and a word to the wise, MAKE SURE THE CGAE PROPERLY FITS TOGETHER BEFORE YOU BOTHER WITH THE STAND!I learned that the hard way, because after about an hour and a half of taking everything out of the box, trying to understand the picture with no words directions and finally putting the stand together by myself to come to find out the cage doesn't fit AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!! The cage pieces were bent, they didn't fit together to form a cage on the stand or in general. I was so upset that over 2 hours of attempting to put this together, it wouldn't work! I'm sure I got a defective piece and Amazon was willing to replace it, but after this experience I didn't want to chance it. I loved the concept of it and it had the features of everything I was looking for but it didn't work out. Maybe you can take your chances with it and hopefully get a good result, but as for me that was about 3 and a half hours I will never get back.",birds,0

"We have a 7 y/o Border Collie who's had problems with his right leg where it joins to his hip, ever since we adopted him at the age of 2.5 years. He would favor his right side, and sometimes drag his leg along as he ran across the yard. A couple of weeks ago, we noticed that our furry family member was slower at getting up, couldn't jump up on our bed anymore, did not want to play, or chase after deer. We could tell that he was distressed, and in pain as he would whimper while trying to move around. I had heard of Glucosamine and Chondroitin for pets, but I was searching for something that also contained MSM. This product has all three, plus added vitamins for support. We started giving our dog, two tablets a day - once in the morning, and once in the evening. These are chewable, so he believes he's getting a treat. About three days after starting him on these tablets; we noticed our dog was more active, and no longer whimpered in pain. A week later, and he's active as a puppy. He doesn't seem to be in any pain. We will continue to give him these tablets, reducing the dose to once a day. Our dog will take one of these tablets once a day for the rest of his beautiful life!

"I purchased this for my dog just after he went blind with cataracts. We were going out of town and I was having difficulty using a leash for him so I thought this would be better for him while we were staying at a hotel. It took a couple times of using it before he bacame safe in it since he did not understand where he was when placed inside it. After adjusting, he loved the security of it. My one complaint though is that he does not like his collar attached to the clip as it gives him a tight feeling around his neck, so I unhook him from that but keep the other clip connected so that he does not try getting out. He is only seven pounds but since he does not realize that he is above the ground, I have to be careful. I wish I would have purchased this a long time ago, he would have enjoyed it and then made the adjustment easier before going blind.

"We have been using these C&S; Suet cakes for about three our four years now. We have ten to twelve suet baskets installed around and near our house; most in plan view, others rather hidden. Living in the middle of an isolated woodland area with many trees and much brush gives the birds plenty of room to establish their own territory.We use the C&S; brand first because the birds like the stuff. Of the many ""flavors"" they offer, we have not found one that the birds reject to any extent. I have watched rather closely and cannot tell a significant difference. Perhaps others may have a different experience and different observations. Secondly, this product can be used year round. It does not melt when the weather is hot, and we do have some hanging in the direct sun. Third, they do not seem to attract the insects that some brands do, nor to that have a bad odor, and fourth, the price of this product is extremely competitive compared to other brands. To be quite frank, I have tried many of the more expensive brands and cannot tell one bit of difference in them and the C&S; brand. I might add that it is always available at local stores in our area which make it rather convenient.We use the C&S; holders and personally prefer the front loaders, i.e. the ones that have tension clips on the top and swing down. We have our holders mounted on trees in a solid fashion at various heights. We do use small staples to permanently attach the basket to the tree as we have found that once in a while raccoons will try to take the entire basket to where ever raccoons take things. C&S; dose make a variety of suet baskets and a person needs to figure out which works the best in their particular situation.We also use the baskets with the coated wider (no rust) and the smaller holes, as this seems to cut down on rodent pilferage...although I do not begrudges an occasional furry critter having a quick meal.These cakes are primarily used by birds of the woodpecker tribe although, especially in the winder, we do have other species use them. We have a rather large woodpecker population near and around us.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",birds,0

Sadly, the ""babble"" component of this ball quit working after just a few days. I tried replacing the batteries hoping that was the problem (battery replacement is easy to do but expensive, btw). No luck. I can hear something broken/ rattling inside the ball. Normally I would not replace a product that breaks so quickly. However, my little dog has been laying around depressed since the babbling stopped, so I'm going to order another and hope the new one lasts.",dogs,3
"These pads are small, and I did want something smaller than the 24x24 I had. But the puppy is only 10 weeks old and he can 'fill' a pad because it spreads out instead of the 'gel' absorbing of my other pads. When I pick up the pad after only 1 use, the floor under seems a little damp. He's only 3 lbs!",dogs,3
Sturdy yet lightweight and easy to use. Can set it up in seconds and from its construction will last many years. The ramp is skid resistant so the dogs have an easy time going up and down without slipping. Both dogs were on it at the same time adding up to close to 300 pounds and it supported the weight with no problem. One minor problem is if your not careful you can pinch your fingers in the hinge end as it can fold quickly as I found out.,dogs,3
"This water fountain is great. My cats (a long hair and short hair tabby) were a little skeptical at first due to the bubbles, but got used to it in less than an hour. I love how much water it holds - I only have to refill it every week and a half or so. The air pump is noiser than expected but it's no louder than the refrigerator so it's easily tuned out. The only time I've noticed it being too loud was when it got knocked on it's side until I moved it right side up.The air nozzle knob that controls the air bubbles doesn't seem to have a wide range of pressures and is stiff to turn. After finding a tolerable level for my cats, I left it alone to ease my frustration. Cleaning is a breeze (I just clean it with a regular soap dispensing brush)and I haven't noticed clumps of hair or food congregating in the bowl like I did with an ordinary standing water bowl. Overall, I think this product is perfect for anyone wanting to have fresher, cleaner water for their animals.",cats,2

"I purchased this as a replacement to my 36 gallon bow front, and it is very thick, nice glass. It came well packaged, but was chipped on the back part which gets covered by the plastic piece that you have to cut for the filters and cords so no big deal.

"Our dog, Charlie, has some allergy issues. As a result, there are certain times when scratching seems to be almost as important to him as breathing. We tried Benadryl (it works but it also renders him listless) and we switched his food to something more natural. The food switch helped but he was still scratching. And though his coat was soft it still felt a bit dry at times.Enter Lipiderm. On the recommendation of someone at the dog park, I bought this and started adding a spoonful to his evening meals. He has had no upset stomach and doesn't seem to mind the taste or texture. I've actually seen him go back after a meal and lick the bowl clean. His coat is softer and shinier than ever and his scratching is reduced from never-ending to on-occasion. We are thrilled and will continue to add this to his evening meal.(Charlie is a Cairn terrier mix.)",dogs,3

"I ordered these as a stocking stuffer for my 3 cats. These springs were not plastic, as the product descriptions said, but METAL coated in a thin plastic. The ends were very sharp, and I sliced open my finger just trying to pull them out of the package. These could easily cut the mouth or paw of a cat or kitten. The springs also smelled strongly of metal and plastic. I wouldn't be surprised if they were made of lead! Do NOT buy these for your cat. This product should be pulled from the market, and I am writing to Amazon to request that they not sell them anymore.",cats,2

"Our vet recommended cosequin ds after our dog suffered from a luxating patella. We started cosequin soon after we discovered the issue. It didn't stop the luxation, however it did seem to help with her recovery after playing aggressively. Prior to cosequin, she would be on 3 legs for days. After cosequin it would be a day or less. She has now had surgery but still goes on 3 legs occasionally. The cosequin definitely makes a difference. In fact, Nutramax also makes a cosamin ds product for humans that my wife takes for hip issues. She says it seems to help a bit. Do note that the effects aren't immediate. It took about a month before the we noticed a difference on our dog.",cats,2

"The Pet Jet is great. Although my Pet Jet came with instructions in French, I didn't even need to read them because it was self-explanatory. The only thing that gave me a panic at first was that it didn't fit my sink faucet. But then I removed 1 of 2 washers, and then it fit perfectly. I later went to M2Pets website & downloaded the instructions in English and I saw that the washer thing was explained. So, depending on your use of the Pet Jet, you may leave both washers in or remove one of the washers.I prefer just to pour the shampoo directly on my dog, so I can't really speak as to how well the shampoo reservoir works. But I can say the sprayer is very powerful & I love how you can make it so that it keeps spraying without you having to hold down the handle. That's very useful.Note--I noticed recently that it says ""Hose not Included"" in the description. I don't know why it says that. That description wasn't there when I bought it & it does have a hose (the one in the picture). So, I'm not sure what's up with that.",cats,2

"This cat fountain is amazing! It's really quiet, holds alot more water than other fountain models, and is easy to clean. My 4 month old kitten took to the fountain right away and doesn't play in the fountain like she did her normal water bowl. The only downside is getting the water to circulate all the way around the globe. We found if we run our hands around the globe to break up the static eventually the water will make it's way all the way around.Looking forward to having this fountain a long time.",cats,2
"I've only tried this on my dog once so far, but it seems to be working really well. My dog tends to bark a lot at other dogs when she is on leash. I took her out for a long walk with the collar on. The first time she barked once, it sprayed her and she clearly was taken by surprise. She got sprayed probably eight or ten times along our walk, each time she barked at another dog. But she was starting to get it - she was barking only once or twice at a dog, not constant barking like previously. The last dog we passed - no bark at all. Next time I use it, I am going to bring treats so I can reward her for not barking. I have been trying to train her to stop this behavior for 3 years with not much success, and this product seems to make a huge difference. The feedback she gets with the spray is immediate and consistent so I think that will help.The product itself seems well made and easy to use. It's very easy to fill from the can of citronella they send you. It works like it's supposed to - spraying when they bark. I never saw it spray her other than when she barked. The spray definitely got her attention. It's not too big or heavy on her neck and she doesn't seem to mind wearing it (she's a medium sized dog).So while we will have to wait and see as to the long term efficacy of this product, so far I am pleased. It works as advertised and seems to be having a positive effect.Update",dogs,3

"Both of my dogs love these bars. They smell good too - like apples. Wellness has a reputation for using quality ingredients, and the ingredient list for these bars is no exception.Eating these bars made one of my dogs itch, though.

"I've tried several brands of Glucosamine. These are very chalky. My dog wouldn't eat them and after I tried crushing and mixing them in with her food, she refused to eat it.

For starters the price was fantastic especially compared to the same product in Oz which was $275 and the effectiveness was immediate however I only used the collar very occasionally and accordingly to a psychologist friend this is the best way to use such a method - use it too much and the dog ignores the correction - intermittant is better. The best way to apply a correction is in the moment and that is not always possible. I have spent a lot of money on trainers before I discovered this collar but I do stress the occasional use - more than a few minutes and you create another adverse reaction.,dogs,3
"I have a 19 pound, 9 months old, Shih-poo. We first got him the red kong for average chewers and he chewed right through it and started eating the pieces so we had to throw it away. Then we got the black kong for extreme chewers and we had the same problem. The only difference between them was that he chewed up the black one in only a slightly longer amount of time. They both were chewed up within around a day and we ended up having to throw them both away. This is at least not for my powerful chewer. I would recommend getting a nyla bone instead because he loves those and they are hard for him to chew through.",dogs,3

"It does require attention every few days, or even every other day, but don't most appliances? When I was running it with three cats, one of whom was ill, it needed daily attention. However, that attention consists merely of mainly making sure the litter level is okay and seeing if the disposable tray needs emptying. I say emptying because I reuse the trays several times before tossing them. (I line them with plastic bags from the grocery store, as another reviewer has already mentioned). When my older cat, Zeus, was sick and urinating a great deal, I would also need to take a litter scoop and scrape the bottom of the pan daily to get rid of the clumps that stuck, and then just turn the unit off and on again to make the rakes do their thing and remove those clumps.When I had the three cats, before I got the LitterMaid I felt like I was on constant litter patrol, and if I didn't completely change the litter every other day, I had a smelly house. With the LitterMaid, my house never has that catty odor. In fact, people are often surprised that I had three cats.Well, poor Zeus passed away in May, so now we have two kitties, and I don't have any trouble at all with clumps sticking. I did have to exeriment early on to find the best clumping litter for the machine. (I use Fresh Step). And yes, washing the entire unit can be a pain, but this only has to be done a few times a year if you occasionally just wipe the unit with a damp cloth.I would imagine that those who are having trouble with the motor burning out are overfilling the pan and making it work too hard. You use much less litter than you do with a traditional pan. If you overfill and the rakes can't get through, the motor will run constantly trying to clean the pan and eventually it will overheat. That's happened to me a few times when some other family member wanted to be helpful and then added too much litter. I found that when I unplugged the unit and let it rest for a few days, it then worked fine when I plugged it back in. Also, I keep my unit in my laundry room and once I had a flood and the motor got wet and stopped working. A few days later, after it had thoroughly dried out, it was as good as new. Getting rid of all that wet litter was horrendous, but that would have been the case with a traditional pan as well.",cats,2

The larger size is nice for water, but laughable for my 70-pound dog's usual food serving which barely covers the bottom of the dish.

"Foster dog didn't have much interest in toys, but loved this one. Squeak is appealing, furry squirrel fun to play with, and rope (coming loose but will be a good separate toy) fine for her ailing teeth. Excellent for all dogs, even small ones. And what a price!",dogs,3

"I never dreamed this thing would work like it does. You keep brushing and brushing and the hair keeps falling and falling. This is one great doggie brush!My doggies agree! They like being brushed with this brush - so much they try and move each other out of the way to get brushed! This has never happened before at grooming time!My only advice would be to get out in the yard or an open area. The brush doesn't hold the hair and the hair doesn't clump up so that you can neatly dispose of it. If you want to clean it up, you'll need to brush it up.",cats,2

"I placed this collar on my dog it took several barks from him then all of a sudden he yelped really loud and all 4 paws left the ground, he leaped about a foot into the air. I instantly removed the collar and had to calm him down. I never put it on him again this is not the way to train a dog it's cruelty. I felt so bad I did this to him. I sure wouldn't want 2 prongs sticking in my neck shocking me.",dogs,3
"I tried it on my 6 month old Golden; it removed a lot of hair. Like they say; it takes a lot of strokes to get the job done, you'll be there quite a long time; and not just the first time... but, if you're diligent, and have the patience; it does what it says it will do; we have A LOT less hair around the house... which makes sense; it removes A LOT; just takes soooo, looong.... ...on the bright side, it's good bonding time with my doggie!!",cats,2
"I would have to say this is my Bichon Frise's favorite toy. She is about 11 lbs, and we got the large. I will say the openings stretched immediately, and the squirrels come out of the holes rather quickly when she puts one in her mouth and walks with it. Nonetheless she LOVES this toy. She will get all three squirrels out quickly and then hang on to either one of the squirrels, or the tree. When I am refilling it she gets EXTREMELY excited and jump around to get it. When I release her to play with it she goes CRAZY for it.I should note that the whiskers were chewed off immediately, so after I noticed the first were off I cut the rest of the whiskers to be safe. Also it is not the most durable toy, but she can be an aggressive chewer if I am not keeping an eye on her. Even though it is missing some of its ""hair"" and its whiskers, I still gave the product 5 stars because like i said Bailey goes crazy for this toy, and has helped us in teaching her fetch and give immensely.",dogs,3

"The Solvit Bench Seat For Pets is doing the job for us. It is a nice fit to our rear bench seat and attaches fairly well. Our dog is a minature schnauzer so we don't experience any movement of the cover although he is tethered while in the seat and on the cover. The durability seems very good although it hasn't been used too much as of yet. The only recommendation for the manufacture would be to offer the cover in several colors to match the interior of newer automobile i.e gray. All in all, satisfied with our purchase and the job it is doing.",dogs,3
"We bought 2 of these gates to block off one room from a rescue dog with housebreaking issues. We like them so well, we've ordered 2 more to block off the other room. The only problem we ran into was that the small pet door was apparently big enough for a 35 pound border collie to shoot through while chasing a cat. Who knew? We taped into place an 8x10 frame (which fit that opening pretty closely) and that solved the problem. Cats go through, border collies don't. Great product at a decent price.",dogs,3

"This is one of the larger litter boxes on the market and we needed it because we have two really 'productive' cats. The bottom half is nice and deep and has no platform in it so you can fill it up with a ton of litter if you like. Since female cats don't squat very low, it's also helpful to have the high rim which prevents leakage. The product feels reasonably sturdy and is an overall good value for the cost.",cats,2

"When the mat first arrived I thought, this is weird, but then after following the instructions for set up, I thought it was pretty cool. Only problem was, after use for about a month, the mat lost it's heat, and the foam pad inside kept shifting, twisting and bunching up. I'm thinking the twisting and such might have caused some problems with the wiring inside and that's why it lost it's heat. Ultimately, I am returning it and probably going to buy one of the hard ""Original Lectro-Kennel"" pads. I have a small one for my rabbit, and even though it's hard, I just toss a little blanket over it and he likes it so hopefully I can toss a thin pad over the hard Lectro-Kennel warming pad and still get a little softness and the warmth too, without the problems.",dogs,3
"Having two dogs is a problem enough but when you have to take them outside to so their business and taking some bags to pick it up does cause some annoyances especially when your low on plastic bags. These bags are just as sturdy as any of the plastic bags I've used before and a lot less prone to having holes(Which I appreciate after having some disgusting accidents when trying to pick up dog poop with a torn bag before) the bags are a little on the small side so if you have a dog bigger than a terrier than I suggest seeing if they sell a bigger size for these poop bags. I say this one is a good trial pack for anyone unsure about this product still like I was at first but you'll be as surprised as I was at how sturdy and how well they actually worked, and after you near the end of this package you can always get the 300 to 700 bag order which I've done as soon as I was finished with this package(Though I just say get the 700 bag order since the cost difference between the 300 to 700 is only about $5.00 dollars)...",dogs,3

The front portion fastens the same manner. Both can be adjusted very easily for different body shapes without compromising the fit.I was intially concerned the jacket seemed thin, but Kiwi has used it many times now and it helps her float very well. She never has minded running around, swimming and hanging out in the jacket, so I assume it's comfortable for her to wear.Overall, very, very pleased with Paws Aboard Designer Life Jacket - Polka Dot.",dogs,3

Secondly it fits the Cat Tracks just fine and is much quieter than their original ball included in the set. My kitties seem to enjoy the flashing lights. Only time will tell how long it lasts. There were no instructions on the packaging so I don't know if anything can be replaced or if you have to buy a new ball when it quits working.I liked this well enough that I purchased an additional one just for them to play without the track.UPDATE",cats,2
We have a GSD and he is a total beast...he can chew through anything! We bought this ball when he was about 6 months old and my husband got the idea to hang it by a longer rope and attach it to our children's swing set. So it hangs down about 3/4 feet from the ground like a tether ball. It's hands down the best form of entertainment for Max. He will jump and clamp down on that ball at just hang from it by his teeth. It's remarkable! The velocity that he hits the ball is a sight to see. He loves it because it satisfies his urge to chew and it has made his hindquarter muscles and shoulder muscles so strong and defined. We get him a new ball about every three months. He looks amazing. This ball is TUFF!,dogs,3

I don't think this can possibly keep her from her diet by THAT much. The fact that it doesn't rely on batteries is great.

I've had a few other filters; Marineland C series and a couple of their HOB, and yet I still use the Cascade 700!You have to make sure that you get the shut off valves just right prior to unscrewing the hoses from the filter itself.

"This product is fabulous! I highly recommend this product to any dog owner, especially if they have a puppy who is still potty training. My puppy was creating havoc when I just let him run loose through my apartment. He'd find favorite areas to relieve himself, so my roommate and I were constantly having to watch him. With the pen, we can confine him when we're gone at work and even when we're home and can't attend to him..such as while cooking, cleaning, etc. This pen is so versatile. We've used it as a rectangular shape, octagon shape, and just as a fence. It gives your pup a lot of room to sleep, eat, drink, and even relieve himself on a puppy pad if need be. And it is portable too! You simply fold it up, secure it with the provided hook and carry it wherever you need to with the handle. It is high enough as well that even when my puppy is full grown, there's no way he could jump over it. (He's a cocker spaniel/bichon frise mix). And YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE!!! For something similar and usually smaller at a pet store, you'll pay at least $20 more. This product has relieved so much stress in my home.

I got this for her on a friends rec and it is by far the best &lt;$10 I've ever spent on a toy for my puppy.I feed her dinner out of the ball. It lets her run around after getting out of her afternoon crate, I can make dinner, she doesn't eat her food in 2 secs flat (like out of a bowl), and frankly -it's the cutest thing she does. She pushes it around topspeed for about 20 secs with her nose and paws. She boxes it in with her paws, and then she zigzags around where the all just passed making sure she didn't lose a piece of kibble.Let's not forget, I get a live version of puppy soccer in my living room and there's no ill effects to my walls or floor.She's so happy with this toy that when it's empty, it gets carried back to her honorific toy spot on her bed (the only time she teeths on it).If it ever wears out (seems unlikely so far), I'd get her another one in a heartbeat.And I haven't noticed bad / plasticy smells from this toy like some other reviewers mentioned - when I got it or now.",dogs,3

"I have 2 cats - one who had a lot of weight to lose and one who is the pickiest eater I've ever seen, even for a cat. (Partly due to a sensitive mouth, but if he doesn't like his food he'll literally go without eating rather than get hungry and pick at it.)I try to feed my family good natural foods and always did the same for pets too, but when we learned that our older guy - the one who looooooves to eat - HAD to lose weight quickly for medical reasons, I bought the best that I could find quickly; a big name brand made with lots of fillers and unrecognizable ingredients. I hated doing it, but all of the wonderful premium foods at our local shops had no weight control options and our vet said that in his situation we really had to feed him weight control.I don't know why I didn't think to search Amazon sooner, but I'm so glad I did! I had never come across this brand at all but was immediately drawn in by the list of ingredients - all real foods, and the first one is deboned chicken. (As in, NOT corn, chicken meal, chicken byproducts, etc.) My husband and I couldn't believe it was really a weight control formula at first because all the others we'd seen so far were filled with all kinds of awful things, but it is indeed a good weight control formula. So it satisfied the cat parent in us... but what about our picky little guy who refuses to eat just about everything?He loves it.For the first time in his life with us (since late kittenhood), his dry food dish is empty after every feeding. He's lean and active so we supplement with organic canned food for him too, but that was usually all he would eat except for maybe a couple of pieces of dry food. Blue Buffalo comes with a ""Finicky Floyd"" guarantee on the back - apparently they have a picky eater there too who they try out all of their food with. If he doesn't eat it, they don't sell it. So besides having great ingredients, it's apparently delicious to cats too. :-)I would recommend this without hesitation. Both of my little guys are waiting for each feeding and are glossy, healthy, active boys. (My 11 1/2 year old has started playing like a kitten again since he's dropped over 5 pounds!)",cats,2

"This was one of my first purchases as a homeowner....I decided on this item based on a few other wonderful reviews. It really does deliver. I have a larger dog, and I find this scoop can handle the ""situation."" I find it slides right under the business, without ripping all the grass up. I suggest it for anyone who has a yard and a dog... I would certainly replace this with an identical product if it broke, or was lost, or stolen, or destroyed in an act of God.Now that winter has appeared in the mid-west, I have discovered that the ""Wire rake scooper for grass"" is really best on the grass. Not the greatest on frozen ground...does OK on snow, but sort of useless on the hard earth, it can't get underneath the business. I think I'll have to consider another type for the winter. This doesn't take away from my opinion of it, as it is clearly listed as ""wire rake scooper FOR GRASS.""",dogs,3
"We HAD to do something about our pets on the furniture before we bought a new couch, and we REALLY needed a new couch, so I did a lot of research and ended up buying these. They are PERFECT. We tested them out on ourselves first and anyone worried about harming their animals is worried for nothing. I even talked about it with my vet as we have two special kitties who sometimes have seizures and both, we think, have cerebellar hypoplasia. But both the kitties did fine when we tested them on it on the floor, and my vet was not concerned. They and our non-special (but still special! hahaha) kitty and the dog learned immediately, took no time at all. I actually over-bought so now I have extra for when we move and buy another chair. Before, the animals were always all over the couch, and the cats would sometimes pee on the couch, which is unfathomably frustrating, especially when it happens over and over. A couch is one of the most annoying things to clean EVER. But this saved us. It worked so well that we could actually buy a leather couch and not have to worry about them clawing it, peeing on it or anything. And we taught them that it's safe when the pads are not on, so they can still snuggle with us when we want them to. The materials are great and do not retain shape-memory, so they unfold flat no matter how long it's been since you used them last. We just roll them up and stick them on our coffee table shelf, they look totally normal there and are easy to whip out in a second. We've had them months and the batteries are still good. We could not be more pleased. WAY easier and simple and cheaper than buying a couch cover, and it's so effortless, it makes all other tactics, like piling things on your couch, or blockading a room with other heavy or bulky things, seem ridiculous. I would recommend that everyone at least try this product, and if you don't like it you can always return it.",dogs,3
"Tried this after reading all the rave reviews. Works pretty good until the plastic clips broke off. Now basically useless.I can see why some people like this when it works. I thought the one of the flaws was that there is no way to put plastic lining so clumps of pee would stick to the bottom, requiring frequent cleanings. Thats when my clips broke.I went with the tidy cat breeze and will never go back to these other types of litter boxes.",cats,2

Well good for you. I lost my receipt and can't get a replacement, so I'm out $50.Seriously people, if you're going to keep fish, spend the money and buy a product that's worth it.

We bought this bed and 2 more of the same type but different colors. They are wonderful! We have three basset hounds whose weights range from 45-52lbs and these beds are big enough that sometimes two bassets will snuggle together in one.This is one purchase that I see the hounds enjoy and appreciate everyday.

My daughter bought a Lercher and I a Golden Doodle. Both of the dogs love their pillows. The Lercher is huge and will soon need a bigger pillow. The doodle is content. The pillow is well made and washes easily. I took the pillow to the breeder a week before puppy pick up to get the scent of brothers and sisters. The technique paid off big time when the doodle came home. It's been washed twice since then and does well.,dogs,3

"The only nice thing about this package is the fabric that goes over the crate. Even that is too small, but it works fairly well. The bumper pad only has tiny place to secure it to the crate, so it slides down and bunches up. The pad that goes at the bottom is way too small, and it bunches up whenever our dog moves around so he ends up just laying on the plastic crate. Very cheaply made, would not recommend. Would have been much better off continuing to use a sheet over the crate instead of wasting money on this.",dogs,3

This thing is great! It is the manual concept of the litter robot at 1/10th the price and has no moving parts to break! The omega claw does need to be emptied more often (once every 1-2 days) but also smells less than the litter robot did because of this. Get a nice tight lidded trashcan to go beside it for your daily emptying. I have had no problems whatsoever and definitely think anything but the large would be too small.,cats,2
"Had I not have just purchased a very fine wire hair comb for $8 from Petco I might be leaving the high feedback you see for this product also.

"I purchased this product to take my small dog (5 lbs) hiking with his big brother and sister. He truly enjoys riding in his pack, and has gone as long as an all-day hike comfortably (with stretching/walking breaks, of course). I like the clip attachment and tie security for extra protection. That being said, I would love to see a sturdier design for this product. The straps are flimsy, the snap buckles plastic, and the base folds up. Stronger straps and back design would help hold up a heavier dog. Still, this product has helped my little pack bond on a favorite activity. This medium size is good for Finn--he's 5 lbs, 10 inches long. A small size would be uncomfortable. He has room for a blanket and sweater for cooler weather.",dogs,3
"Like everyone else posting a review here, I am getting great results with this little tool! I have noticed less shedding in the house - hooray!

He's leash-trained, so we've incorporated combings into our walking routine and he seriously seems to love it. I definitely second those reviewers who advise using this tool outside - whole bird colonies have created nests from the fur flying off this tool! Note that Amazon is offering a great price on this item as compared to local retail stores and vet offices.",cats,2

"Ever try to give your dog a bath? It wiggles out in the yard and gets dirt and ticks all over the fur--stickers,too--before you can ever dry it off. Mom and dad used the bathtub to clean our dog--mine! To this day a pile of grease and dirt is so stained on the porcelain we can never clean it off. Heck, I only take showers in it, it's SO dirty. This waterless pet cleaning brush worked fine. It's easy to use and it lifts all the tick and lice eggs off the pet without hurting or infecting it with wetness. It also keeps the fur from matting up and will untangle a lot of matting in the hair. Our dog is gone now after almost twenty years. She lived that long because we used this brush instead of a bath where dogs pick up colds, fevers, and more ticks afterwards. Experts say you should almost never give your pet a bath--it dissolves natural protective oils in the fur. Of course, injury or exposure to a lot of dirt are exceptions.",dogs,3

"I have a cat that loves to urinate on my favorite lazy-boy chair. I read some bad reviews of this product before buying, I just wasn't smart enough to pay attention to them. I felt sure this would do the trick. It just sounded like such a wonderful idea, and believed it would work. But unfortunately, it just doesn't. After putting this on the chair, I admit I didn't sit and watch for hours or anything, but I used it faithfully for about a week. I saw my cat jump up a few times, and the alarm didn't even go off. Perhaps it did, when I wasn't around, but it must not have scared her. It's not very loud, or scary sounding. She continued to pee on the chair, right beside the Tattle Tale device. I continue to wonder if this product might have potential, if they improve on the idea by making it much louder, and much more sensitive to movement. But as it is, this is a total, and complete waste of money. Don't order it. I ended up buying a Scat-Mat, which cost a bundle, but was well worth every penny. But if you buy a Scat-Mat, just try to remember not to sit on it yourself! It hurts!",dogs,3

The first couple hours after it was set up were hilarious because one cat was so upset about the water he kept trying to hit it with his paw but got wet instead. Anyway, they drink so much water now, I've noticed. My only problem is I have to keep refilling the base every couple of days because the reservoir never empties out. It just stays in the container and sits there. I don't understand why it does that. I even moved it to another portion of carpet to make sure it wasn't an issue with the floor being uneven. Does anyone have suggestions? I've gone through the FAQ at the drinkwell site and there is nothing regarding the reservoir not properly working. Any suggestions are very welcome.",cats,2

Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures, she was placed on seizure medication. We completed the class, we stopped with the pup peronis. We just purchased another pup, and began training with him. Because he was getting the pup peronis, so was the 2 year old dog and she began having seizures again.

That means about 12 batteries/yr that I am purchasing and disposing when they are discharged. That is a continuously recurring cost to operate the radio fence for my 2 pets. Amazon seems to have the best price for this product, so that is where I check first when I need them. I have seen the price range from $1.50-$6.00 each. Why can't they make these batteries rechargeable? This would lower the cost of operation and be better for the environment.",cats,2

Since I have 4 cats this makes it easier for more than 1cat to eat out of the bowl at the same time. Petsafe feeder has much smaller bowl. This feeder works better than Petsafe in having the food continue to fill the bowl. This one requires some jiggling, but the wider opening for food allows the cats to figure out how to get more food into the bowl. Petsafe doesn't replenish the bowl very effectively. Would have gone with 5 stars if the food replenishment was smoother.",cats,2

"So I previously had the plastic version of this PetSafe door. We used for several years and it served us well enough, although it probably ended up costing us hundreds in extra energy costs, but at least our cats could get to and from the screened in porch easily.We had a new door installed during a recent home renovation and had to decide whether to keep the old plastic PetSafe or upgrade to something better. I looked around quite a bit, online and at local home improvement stores. To my surprise, I really didn't see anything better.I decided to go ahead and order this Aluminum version, my logic being that an aluminum pet door was probably better than the plastic version I had. Right?So was it better? Well, the plastic door insert that comes with this aluminum door is better because it has a small metal locking mechanism, so it is slightly more secure than the plastic insert of our previous version. I liked the tinted door flap, which makes it more difficult for people outside the door to see light from inside the house. That also seems to offer slightly better security. The aluminum frame is not really that ornate, however, with screws and metal bolts clearly visible. It looks reasonable once installed however.The seal is about the same as the plastic version, but the magnet that keeps it in place is smaller. The stripping on the sides also pick up cat hair like crazy and really need to be cleaned daily. We didn't have this problem with the plastic version side stripping.Others have mentioned this, but let me put this issue to rest",cats,2

"In a holiday flurry of activity, I ordered this 25 w heater for my half-filled ten gallon aquarium environment where a little turtle and three zebra fish live. It arrived in the mail on Friday, I popped it in the 7 gallon tank that evening, set the thermostat to 73 F, turned down my house thermostat to 60 F, and headed out the door for the weekend, keeping my fingers crossed. I was shocked to arrive home on Sunday night to a perfectly regulated temperature in my tank (and happy turtle and fish), even though my home was a good ten degrees colder. Though this is not a recommended technique for getting your tank set with the heater, it sure gives me confidence in this little submersible Italian heater. I'm very impressed so far.

That said, due to how big the holes can be (the holes differ in size) we can only put treats that just fit in the large holes, and smaller and they come out so easily. We use the Milkbone Medium sized bones for this. We still prefer Kongs for stuffing treats in though. And I will say that we have had several JW brand dog toys and I guess we should be grateful that our dog doesn't chew on this one because he has chewed through just about all other JW toys.",dogs,3

"My cats have never loved a toy like they love this one! The feathers twirl on the end, so when I move it back it forth it looks like a bird flying over their head. I guess that's why they call it Da Bird. Neither of my two cats can resist this toy. They will jump extremely high to try to catch it and it keeps them active for a long period of time. I've only had it for about two months and I do need a replacement feather for it already, but both of my cats have their claws making it easy for them to rip out a feather every now and then. I would definately recommend this cat toy.",cats,2
"My 2 year old kitties go nuts immediately. I've never seen them ""flying"" like this. I am not sure what makes DaBird so special, but they both LOVE it! One cat hissed at the ""bird"" several times after she catches it. Also you may not believe but they started to recognize the word ""DaBird"" and when I ask them if they want to play DaBird, they get excited and start meowing!Our bird last only a week. We're getting into expensive habit but if you want your cat fly, get DaBird.",cats,2
"I bought this cage 4 months ago for my son's hamster. Hammy had a huge 3 story cage but began chewing on the bars, so I love that this cage doesn't have any bars for the hammy to chew on. This cage is kinda small, but will work for 1 hamster. We are adding to it to keep hammy happy. The cage comes with a large base in which the hamster can burrow in the bottom, we fill this with bedding and hammy loves to sleep down there. The ""second level"" is not really a level per se, but more a feeding tray with a small built in dish for food. The cage comes with a water bottle that I like, and didn't take hammy too long to learn to use it. The top part is wobbly, but won't fall over or anything. Our hammy sometimes sleeps in that part. The wheel does get squeaky after a while, but you could oil it if it bothers you. Our hammy is in the living room, so this doesn't bother us. The wheel is nice, though, and has a little part underneath to catch any pee or poopies that end up in the wheel. This cage was easy to put together and features two locks on the sides for security. The top of the cage that opens up is great for feeding hammy. The side also opens to access a burrowed hammy. The wheel opening can be flipped over to close off the wheel for cleaning or if you don't want the hammy in the wheel. All in all, we love this cage, and plan on adding some more pieces.",small animals,5
Got the XSmall (which says 4-8 pounds)for a 5 pound chihuahua. It dosent fit. It is too small. It slides right off. You cant even duct tape it to a sweater to get it to stay up like u can with a disposable bc it is too heavy.,dogs,3
"I know people have said that the weak point of this product is that the handle breaks easily, so we're being careful with that. In all other ways this product does exactly what we needed. Our border collie's very thick undercoat came out easily without discomfort for him. On the contrary, he behaves as if he is getting the best massage of his life. It's hilarious! He loves it. We also have long-furred cats for whom spring is usually a misery of shedding and hairballs. One tends to get bad tangles and matts in her fur. Let me tell you--all of them like this rake and it gets the undercoat quickly and easily so they will be cooler, more comfortable, and less prone to that horrible ACKACKACK I'm-gonna-stain-the-carpet announcement all long-fur-cat owners dread. I myself use a CPAP at night and the straps in back of my hair tend to give me tangles in my super-fine hair. I resorted to trying this on myself a couple of days ago. It's a bit embarrassing to admit but it took MY tangles right out without pulling or discomfort. Honestly, if I had to go through raising little girls again, I'd want one of these to get the tangles from their hair. The tears and conflict over hair brushing would be gone. It flat-out works and works quickly and I'd bet it would work on any kind of hair, including any human hair. They should make and market a version for little girls whose mothers do battle every morning on tangled hair and tender scalps.",dogs,3
"It took a few days to get used to putting this collar on, but now even my 9 year old does it effortlessly. After my 60 lb. Black Lab/German Sheppard mix kept dragging my poor kids across the yard, not to mention the fact that she pulled my wife down, severing her ACL and causing her to have to go through the painful ACL replacement surgery (she's still in physical therapy but back to about 95% now), I knew that we had to do something to stop the constant pulling. I spoke with a friend of mine that has Rotties and she recommended this collar... It's perfect. The kids now have total control when they're walking the dog and my wife no longer fears a repeat of the debacle that occurred this past fall. This is a humane, painless way to contol your uncontrollable pooch. If pulling is a problem for you, the answer is just a click away!",dogs,3
I have a 3 month puggle and this particular size doesn't seem to be enough for a day. I end up using 2/day even after taking him to pee outside in between. It also leaks and doesn't absorb as much as some others that I have tried before.,dogs,3
"We have both a medium and a large version of this toy. We initially bought the medium for our Presa Canario (Bella) when she was a puppy. She had a great time nibbling and trying to get the treat out but was unable to. We lost the toy and a couple months. Later when we found it, our puppy had grown considerably and could easily pop the treats out and attempt to swallow them whole. As a result, we decided the toy was too small for her and gave it to our Norwegian Elkhound (Nikki) who also loved it. It took her several hours but she was also able to pop the treats out but being a mature dog knew better than to try to swallow them whole.Later, we decided to buy the large one for Bella and she absolutely had a blast with it. After hours she would be able to pop the treat out but we pop it back in and she would have to work at it some more.I would say this is a great toy for dogs that need stimulation and like to chew and rip things up. Although the treat can be popped out by both of our dogs the ball itself has survived several refills and weeks of play. This is not a toy i would leave the dog unattended with. If you do leave them unattended they will probably pop the treat out and eat it the first day you get it. Keep an eye on them and be there to grab the treat and pop it back in and they will get hours of focused play with this toy.It is much more difficult to get the treats out of the large toy so even if you have a smaller dog it is a good idea to go ahead and get the larger version. Bella and Nikki definitely would recommend this toy. They both love it.One small downside other than the treats popping out, the dogs do quite a bit of drooling with this toy. In the case of Bella, we had to establish that it was a toy she could only have while in the kitchen so that she wouldn't drool all over the living room carpet.In addition, the replacement treats are a bit expensive considering the amount of time they take the dog to consume. In short, i gave this 4 stars because although your dog is virtually guaranteed to have a great time with it, it's not every day toy.",dogs,3
"I've used this leash for three dogs now and although I've bought replacements in new colors, the first one still works as well as the most recent purchase. I will recommend keeping the leash shorter if you have a very active dog or if your dog becomes excited or agitated around other people or animals, as they can move very quickly and get away from you. It's also important to be cautious when the leash is extended if the dog runs around people because the leash can actually cut through a body with friction. Once you get comfortable with the button mechanism, your reflexes improve and the walks are more wonderful because the dog can feel more free with the additional space around them. I considered buying another of the very small size but found the handling to not be as comfortable as this. I love all of mine!",dogs,3
"My little kitty is a finicky one. She loves to scratch on anything, really, but since she got this, she stopped scratching on anything else. She runs around like mad, but stop at this, scratches and then continue running, until she is back at the post. The other day she tried to jump up on it, but for some reason she couldn't. I don't know why, I have seen her jump higher, but it made me laugh. She will on occasion to as the cat in the picture does, climb on to it.I got this because I had heard she had used it in a previous home, and that it is a great post. I am not sorry I got it. My furniture sure is happy about this scratching post!",cats,2
"If you've never had a ""Kennel Trained"" dog, you're missing a good bet. My guys love their kennels--they seek them out for ""quiet"" times or if there's anything unnerving (thunder storms, fireworks).

We've been using this unit with multiple furry cats who like to dip their paws in the water. It has lasted well over a year. You do need to take it apart and clean it once a month or so. Every 3-4 months clean out the pump as well. The submersible pump is fully servicable,cats,2

"We received this with a dog potty that we recently purchased and, so far, it's working great! The only downfall is that she loves to rub her face in it after I spray it on the potty grass. But it definitely makes her go in the right spot. I usually spray it on the grass just before I think she needs to use her potty and it's training her away from using her normal spot in the yard.",cats,2

"My dogs go nuts when they see the bag like they need a fix. That's why my family kids about Greenies being doggie crack. I am careful though to make sure I stay with them when they are enjoying them. Because they are so hard and the dogs tend to eat them quickly, I have had a choking incident with the Greenies. I also buy the smaller size to try and avoid this but I don't discourage buying them. I highly recommend them. They are great for their gums, teeth and BREATH even if only temporary. Your dogs will love them.",dogs,3
"My russian wolfhound is huge, but had no problem using this when we went on trips versus lugging his big metal one around. For our husky we bought the medium and after a day she went right through the mesh. She's now in a smaller plastic carry cage for when we go on trips.It is a good idea and I live the compactness for storage, but you just have to have the right dog others some like our will destroy it.",dogs,3
"I bought 2 sizes of these, small and a medium. They fit perfectly, and very easy to put on and off. The dogs even know it's time to go outside when I pick up the jackets. This is definitely a good buy.",dogs,3
"I loved this item for the first three months that it ran. Unfortunately, it broke and by that time I didn't have the receipt or the box... so the store refused to help, and the company refused to honor the warranty (even though they were aware that some models have a bad habit of running to the front of the machine and refusing to go backwards!). So... try it... you might get a better model/run than I did. But I think I'll be trying the LitterSweep Ultra since it has less chance of litter interferring with it's sensor or motors.",cats,2
"The one-star rating is for the company, not the product. As was a previous reviewer, I too was misled in thinking I was going to receive the meal replacement, but instead received the meal supplement. These are two totally different products. I should've listen to person who reviewed this previously, but I was thinking that maybe that was a one-time mistake as no one else seemed to have the problem...WRONG! This misrepresentation really needs to be corrected! If you are looking for the meal REPLACEMENT, order elsewhere.",cats,2
"definitely 100 steps up from their ""ultra"" blend, this ""ultimate"" crunchy blend has made a serious improvement in my ferrets energy, itching problems and smell. this is his staple diet, but i supplement with small amounts of zupreem, evo, or other decent brands just to mix things up a bit and provide a little more fat content.",small animals,5
"I had this box for a couple of years and it was getting kinda yucky. So I decided to replace it with the newer model (not sure of the number, but it was the more rounded one with metal rake). I hated that one and after about 3 months went serching for this one again. The 700 is just the right size. I like how it rolls up at the end of the cycle before tipping back down to dump the ""load"". The plastic rake works just fine. It is used by one cat, but the bin still fills up pretty fast (about a week). I have read others mention dumping and reusing the bins (I guess this would be fine, but I don't), so there is a continuing cost for the bins. Over all my cat (Emma) and I love it.By the way, it is not totally maintenance free, you can't just ignore it for a week! I use the scoop daily to stir the litter and remove any little particals that may be left behind and to make sure the bottom is scrapped clean, but this process takes about a minute/day. My cat uses the same spot in the box everytime, so sometimes the bin gets filled up on one side, again, just use the scoop and even it out.I highly recommend the LitterMaid 700.",cats,2
"I would give these six (or more) stars if I could.My dog is absolutely addicted to these biscuits; they are the only ones she will eat after she comes back from a walk. I had been getting them at Trader Joe's (under their own label) and I was distraught when they were discontinued (fortunately I did not tell my dog, because she would have been inconsolable). A quick Google search brought me to Amazon and these biscuits--which had been packaged under private label for TJ.Now I no longer have to worry about reproachful looks when she doesn't get her favorite cookies.Reasonably priced, they are easy to break in half or in quarters and great for dogs that cannot chew hard biscuits--or to hide a pill inside.",dogs,3
The furminator is an amazing deshedding tool. I have used all kinds of brushes including the curry comb but the furminator out does everything. My vet reccomended it to me.AND my dog LOVES it.

"I wanted a quick & convenient way to pick up the dog poo in the backyard before the kids play & this little rake gets the job done...well technically I get the job done while using the rake. The handle isn't as long as a full size rake. I'm 5'3"" so I don't have to bend over much, but someone taller definitely would. It doesn't take up a lot of space, scoops the poo out of the grass & weathers the outdoors, all at a very reasonable price.",dogs,3

"I purchased this toy for my three month old Rott/Lab mix puppy. He seemed excited when I gave it to him and he ran into the other room to play with it. I threw the packaging away and followed him (it was less than a minute) and by the time I got to him he had six of the knots chewed off the ends of the strings and I could only find four. This would be ok for supervised play, but definitely should not be advertised as a ""teether"" as it will not stand up to a lot of chewing. The two missing knots did turn up the next day as a colorful surprise during our morning walk.",dogs,3
"I thought another reviewer was crazy for complaining about the smell of this toy...and then I got it in the mail. I have to say, it kind of makes me feel nauseous. It has a weird, sickeningly sweet smell that won't go away. I'm kind of worried about giving it to my dog, who so far, seems to like playing with it when it's filled with food.Otherwise, it works great. It is harder to get food out of the squirrel dude than Kongs, which is good and entertains the dog for a longer time.Unfortunately, I'm afraid to handle the thing because of the smell!",dogs,3

"Our female dogs suffer from separation anxiety when we try to leave them to go out to dinner when traveling. Because of the barking and whining that they could possibly make and fear of pissing off the tenants in the ajoining rooms we end up just eating in our room to keep them calm. They howl or bark like crazy. To aleviate the problem my husband stays with them and I go down to the restaurant to pick up the food and we just eat in our hotel room. With this product we were able to give it to them within 1 hour to going out and they remained calm and quiet. We left the hotel room and the girls just sat their on the bed. They were not groggy or sleepy just peaceful and calm. they did not even bark when someone walked passed the room window. I don't use it often but when I do, it is so nice to know we can leave them and they remain calm and don't freak out.",dogs,3
"Had ordered Gentle Leader collar, which was better than the choke chain I'd been using, but Sierra still pulled and bucked like a horse. I ordered the Gentle Leader Harness and I love it!

"I have a 110 pound mutt who really is pretty smart. Most of the time. Unfortunately, once we go a on walk, he forgets that he is smart, and pulls like crazy. Of course, I'm sure I ultimately could have trained him not to pull, but after many tries, I got frustrated, he got frustrated, and we never got to enjoy our walks. The gentle leader works very well. He complained a little about it when we first got it, but I just had him wear it for a few minutes longer each day while giving him treats (he's very food motivated, except when it comes to not pulling my arm out of socket everytime he sees a bird when we are walking), so after about 4 days, he tolerated wearing it and our walks are delightful now.You do need to be careful how you use it. You can't jerk the leash at all, but you don't need to, really.I am a believer, and recommend the GL to anyone with a large dog who pulls.",dogs,3
"The Product Description from the Manufacturer is incorrect. The gate DOES NOT span 28"" to 103"" (the product description under the Manufacturer description IS correct stating that the gate spans from 60"" to 103""). Unfortunately the gap we were trying to span is 58"" (but we did improvise a solution).The wall hooks do seem a bit flimsy but the height is high enough to keep our 17 month old from trying to climb over it but low enough that I, at 5'2"", can step over it. It seems a rather imperfect solution for an awkward opening between our hallway and kitchen, but at least it's not incredibly expensive and it does work. If you have a wide opening and a bit of extra money I'd go with another option, but this gate isn't terrible for the price.",dogs,3

I then floated it inside the aquarium before putting it on the side of the tank. Stupid me started right down the front rather than the side. Yes, it scraped off the algae. It also scraped up the acrylic. I did not notice until I got to the bottom of the tank and looked at the path it made. Out of the package ten minutes and my tank is scratched to all_____.

I found one flea on my dog and ordered this. So far no more fleas. I had tried to use this product a couple years ago when there was a bad flea problem in my neighborhood and had found that the pills had worked better at that time.

"This design is a good idea, but there are a few drawbacks.Pros:I no longer have to go treasure hunting and can just easily do it all in one swoop.Works as well as all other covered litter boxes in containing litter and smellsCons:First off, the latches on mine don't seem to fit snugly half the time, leaving a small gap on the right side. When I go to roll the box, I get a small pile of litter on the floor from the gap. My solution was to attempt latching that one first. It's the one on the front next to the scoop.Second, clumping litter is really the only kind of litter you should use with this box. However, my cats like to pee in one part of the box and poo everywhere else, so the pee all clumps up in a giant mass on the bottom. When you roll the box, you have to give the bottom a few good whacks to get that stuff off the bottom. Sometimes litter goes flying out the door doing this.Clean the box often, with two cats the box can fill up fast and the scoop drawer can get over full and not fit through the hole very well.Sometimes smaller pieces of poop and pee clumps can fit through the screen. Also some will get caught under the scoop and wont really come out until you do a thorough cleaning.Lastly, the top is clumsy to remove when you need to add/change the litter.Overall, regardless of all the cons, It's a pretty good litter box and I recommend it.",cats,2
at last -- a solution for pet hair that works! i have two domestic short hair tabbies who produce copious amounts of hair. they suffer from hairballs and are constantly throwing them up. i saw this tool on home shopping tv and instantly bought it. it is fantastic and gets both the top hair and the undergrowth off. my catties love it! they love to be groomed now as it does not hurt them the way other brushes do. i was amazed at how much hair came off them. plus it is very gratifying to do this for your pet. their coats come out beautiful and soft. you can really see the difference on them. well built and durable.

"I have two cats and two dogs at home. Even tho they never really go out besides the backyard we had a big problem with fleas. I try Frontline and it didn't work at all. I was washing one of my dogs almost everyday and once she had almost a hundred fleas that I picked off her in the shower. Finally my mother-in-law talked about Bio Spot that she had used years ago when my husband was younger and they had dogs and cats at home. For the super low price I bought Bio Spot for all my pets. The amount of product in each ""small bottle"" is a lot. Way more than other brands we tried before. Right away the pet hair gets grease and it does not have the greatest smell in the world. Still, none of my pets had any bad reaction except my bulldog who would try to wipe it off her back since she can't stand anything with strong smell (like acetone, perfume or anything like that). After a week or so all the fleas were gone! We didn't even have to work that hard to get rid of the fleas that were probably all over the house. After 3 months of using it I found a flea on my dog only a couple of times. I'm ordering more now and I will keep using Bio Spot as long as it keeps the fleas off my pets and house!",dogs,3

"I have bought countless toys for my cat, and invariably, after one or two days, he got bored with them. I've had this for over a month now, and he plays with it constantly. Everyone loves watching him jump around and pounce on it, it's quite entertaining watching your cat think a toy is going to somehow jump away before he can get to it. I highly recommend this toy, I'm glad I listened to the other positive reviews. We had a similar toy to this made of cheaper plastic, but the ball just didn't go around quite as smoothly, and he got bored with it. The ball on this one will go around about 6 times after he pushes it, entertaining him. The scratch pad does need to be replaced, (he actually USES this one rather than my couch now) so I suggest buying a few replacements with it. As a matter of fact, I just purchased 4 extra packages of pads (8) to hold us over for the next 6 months or so, and that's why I'm here writing this review! Definitely worth the money since it is used, and since I only have the one cat, I like to see that he is occupied and active as much as possible when I'm not able to play with him.",cats,2

We had a few minor issues with it, but overall it worked pretty good. It wore out a couple months ago. I saw the ""new and improved"" LitterMaid Elite model, and I thought the new design looked good. It was more expensive than the older model, but I figured that was because of its new and improved design, and it would be worth the extra cost. Well, with the very first use I didn't like it. The motor is very loud--quite a bit louder than the older model. And after two months of trying to get it to work by adjusting the litter level like some other reviewers recommended, I am ready to throw it out. It simply does not work. It's really disgusting--rather than scooping and dumping, it smashes and smears, jams and spills. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MODEL. I'll buy the older model if I can find it, or I will go back to the old-fashioned ""do it yourself"" scooping.If the rating system would have allowed me to give it ""No Stars"", that's the rating I would have given it. One star is too good for this hunk of junk.",cats,2

"My Yorkie is neurotic and gets diarrhea when she gets upset or nervous (storms, beeping noises, visitors). She will eat this off my finger or her plate, rather than me having to hold her down and squeeze it down her throat with a syringe like the Diarsanyl the vet gave us (though that also stops the diarrhea). The only thing I don't like is the cost for shipping it (about $8 shipping for a $13 tube); since it must be kept refrigerated it comes packed with ice so I understand the company's cost to ship is more. I can't buy in bulk since I only use about 1 tube every 6 months and I don't want to wind up with expired product I didn't use. But it works and I don't feel bad giving it to my dog so I pay it. My breeder, known for her show dogs, recommended this to me.",dogs,3

"I bought this ball after searching online for an indestructible dog ball that could stand up to tough chewers, and also would float. We used to use the old Buddy Balls, but they just don't make them like they used to. I have a dog who loves to play ball in the pool, so it had to float. And another dog who just wants to chew and destroy the ball, so it had to be tough. (He has shredded the kong in the past). This Huck ball is great! I don't know how or why it is so tough, but so far the 2 balls i purchased have lasted 5 months. Past purchases - about 5 days! It is heavy and has a thick feel, but it floats. My shepherd mix plays in the pool with it, and it's the right size for him. Not too small. But my beagle can also carry it around, thanks to the grooved shape. Beagle loves to chew, and is surprisingly destructive for his size, but so far no problem with this ball. We like it! Worth the price.",dogs,3

I think that it removes odors to a very good degree, but I don't think that they are totally removed. I had a problem area with my dogs. I used this product... quite a number of times on the same spot... I can still smell it. Not as bad as before but the high hopes I had of it vanishing permanently... not there. I am not saying that it is not good... just not as good as they said. At this point, I am wondering if there really is any one product that can make anything vanish completely? I probably would not order more of the same product, although I went and ordered two huge bottles in the first place. Maybe try something else next time.

"We have a few hens and keeping their water flowing in the wintertime can be tricky (and not a little backbreaking as well!). We got this dish to see if that might solve our problem. It does, but we found that when the cold wind blows, the &#34;girls&#34; stay inside the coop and do their scratching and dust bathing inside. Thus, within only a short while their water bowl was quite mucky.A friend on one of the chicken forums suggested a solution. We now fill the bowl, plug it in and then set our 3 gallon plastic fountain on top of it. The heated water below keeps the water in the fountain tray ice free and the water in the tray keeps the water in the fountain from freezing.If you are getting this to water your chickens in the winter, try this method. It has kept the water in the fountain and it's tray ice free and available into the low teens through the night. The person who first told me about this was from New Jersey and had been using this method for two winters. Their nighttime temps tend to be much lower than ours.Money well spent and now, with a few &#34;adjustments&#34; our girls no only have de-iced water, the also have CLEAN fresh water!!I will tell you...the company told me the cord was 6'. Ours was not quite that, more like 5' or 5 1/2'. We had to raise the bowl on a couple of cinder blocks to reach the electrical outlet which is on the ceiling of our coop...so bear that in mind. It WAS an easy adjustment, but be aware of it.",cats,2
"Now, they even have them in the south!The Gentle Leader should not be confused with other head collars like the Halti. It is FAR superior for any dog breed or temperament.I've trained both my Golden Retrievers as well as the dogs of several relatives and many friends over the past six years using the Gentle Leader. With the possible exception of toy breeds, this is a God-send for any dog owner with a rambunctious, head-strong or hard to handle canine or if you just wants more control without the extra work and even trauma associated with neck collars in general.I had my first Gentle Leader dog and then my second, walking and STAYING at heel, sitting automatically upon stopping, turning both left & right and no longer lunging, pulling, jumping or straying...and all within less than 15 minutes for EACH dog! Golden Retrievers are, of course, wonderfully easy and willing to train anyway, but this was SO incredibly fast, it was almost like watching some magic trick being performed.It was my vet at Fort Lewis, WA who first taught me how to fit the collar and use it. Application is simple once you see it done for the first time. Just place the nose strap short of the flesh on the nose (allowing the dog to breathe, eat, drink and even carry items) and tightten the head strap about one finger tight behind the ears (base of the head, really). This gives you control (nose strap) and the dog a sense of well-being (head strap). Nothing at all is on the dogs neck or throat. I strongly encourage you to have someone experienced with the Gentle Leader's use show you hot to fit it properly the first time.For all dogs I've since trained or assisted in their training there has been the short-lived ""leader dance"". This is where, after placing the leader for the first time, the dog hops in the air and then bows to the ground all the while with both front paws over it's nose while trying remove the collar. As you continue to give short firm tugs on the collar while continuing to walk the dog, the dance quickly disappears within just a few yards. I was amazed at how consistant this behaviour and its let up always is.The leader basically uses the same physical restraint that a mother dog or pack alpha male uses to control a puppy or young dog. A grip over the nose and pressure at the back of the neck. It's purely coincidental that it looks like a horse halter.The control comes from the strap over the nose. The leash clips to the bottom of this strap (under the lower jaw). A short, quick (but not violent) tug on the leash leash brings the entire head under control. The head follows the nose and where the head goes, the body must follow.There is NEVER any need for jerking, pulling or strangling of the dog. There is never leash rope burns from having the dog take control and lunging away with you. Your arms stay in their sockets, palm blisters are a thing of the past (especially if you use a cotton leash, or at least a leather one...NEVER use chain or poly-fiber leashes).Some breeds with huge necks and a high pain tolerance, such as Rottweilers, are easily and gently brought into line. My brother's was 2 years old and completely out of control. He was at heel, sitting and turning within 5 minutes or so and after I turned the dog over to my brother for about 15 minutes I took the dog back and let his 6 year old daughter lead him around. My cute tiny niece was less in control than the dog, yet they both performed as a team with ease.The coolest thing about the Head Collar is how the dogs get really excited when they see it, knowing that it's going for a walk, training or just out in public. They LOVE the Gentle Leader.The Gentle Leader is only used for training or control. The dog STILL wears its own neck collar, but only to keep his tags on, since dogs don't normally come with pockets.The Gentle Leader is also a huge facilitator for ""off-leash"" training. The dog is so comfortable in taking properly given commands on leash, that doing so ""off-leash"" seems to take only one half to one third the normal time I was once involved. That, my friends, is a super endorsement, alone!One last caution...I pray you are in no way a person who ""stakes"" out a dog for ANY reason. Regardless, the Gentle Leader should NEVER EVER be used to keep a dog attached to a stake or wire run. Running out to the end of the line and coming up short by the neck/shoulders is one thing with a neck collar. Staking a dog and KNOWING that a head collar will actually jerk and twist the head to snap the neck is nothing less than cruelty, if not out and out murder. Use the Gentle Leader ONLY with a leash with YOU on one end and the dog on the OTHER, please.I hope you found this useful, as I KNOW you find the Gentle Leader to be. Take care and pass a good time with your canine friend.",dogs,3
"Perfect for my needs. I have a 40 lb dog who uses this tie out cable. It seems perfectly sturdy without being excessively heavy. It has not kinked or twisted.I did receive a blue cable in case anyone is concerned about color.Edit on 10 Oct 2012.This cable has rusted and has faded to almost white.

"This toy is the best thing I have ever bought for Kane, my American Pit Bull Terrier.He is a little over a year old and this is the first toy to last more than 5 minutes with him. He absolutely LOVES it. I have to physically put it away, otherwise he won't stop playing with it. It's a great combo toy -- something you can throw, something you can tug, something that floats, and something your dog can chew on.It says that it is made of a puncture resistant material, but it does get tooth marks and scratches in it quite easily. However, when he gets tired of rolling it around on the ground, he will lay there and bite down with the full force of his bite over and over and over again like a baby sucking on a pacifier and it hasn't popped yet! This is the same dog that can deflate a basketball in mere seconds.I highly recommend this for those dog owners with aggressive and/or hard chewers (Kane can destroy even an EXTREME Kong in about two months and this Jolly Pet toy has lasted 5 months now). In terms of burning off energy, if you just let them chew it, I would say it's comparable to an hour-long session of hardcore fetch or a 3 hour hike, so it's great for those high energy dogs too! Kane is a really active dog (he gets two 3-mile hikes every day, plus 2 sessions of fetch and swimming time at our lake when I can manage it, and he is still raring to go), but he can play with this toy for 1/2 an hour and conk out for the next hour to two hours if I take it away. :)So, come one, come all, ye who own aggressive and/or hard chewers and/or highly active dogs.This is the toy for you!",dogs,3
"This product has been a life saver for me!!! The only reason I rated it as a 4 rather than a 5 is because when we first got it, there was at least 1 time where it didn't turn like it was supposed to in order to feed my cat. But that was only 1 time, about 3-4 weeks ago. Since then, it's been amazing! And it's really easy to use! My cat doesn't bother me about food. Other reviews said their cat broke into it within a few days. We went away for 4 days and when we came back, my cat had tried to claw and bite it to get to his food but was unsuccessful. Occasionally he still bites it because he can smell his food but he can't get into it. I would recommend not putting food in the container or opening it where your cat can see you. I open it up and fill it with food on the counter where he can't see me. My cat is pretty smart and I think if he saw how I opened it, he would be able to get into it.Bottom line",cats,2
"I originally found this rope years ago at a Petsmart, and decided to give it a try due to the dental benefits it lists. It quickly became my dog's favorite chew toy, and the durability of this rope is above all others I have tried. Any other rope toys I have bought for her have been torn to shreds within 2-3 days, but this rope tends to last at least a couple weeks, if not longer. When she does manage to shred it, it does leave a lot of little strings all over the house, but what rope won't?The price on Amazon simply can't be beat, easily beating the pet store's prices by five dollars or more, which is great since my dog loves to go through these ropes as quickly as possible. It also keeps her teeth nice and clean, so it's a winner in my book.",dogs,3
"Ok. No one likes this particular form of backyard clean-up. At least now you can buy a tool that makes the job quick and not so dirty. Why didn't I buy this thing sooner? It keeps you a couple feet away from the business end, scoops right through grass to only pick-up what you're after and feels like it will last a long time (sturdy construction). The last scooper I had was this hand-held scissor-like thing that required you to get your hand down to the ground and it grabbed the grass as you lifted up. (I had to be careful not to close the scooper too tightly as I lifted up - I didn't want the grass to break off and get a scoopful of poo in my face!) This design just works. If this company made a version with the tines of the rake a little closer together, I would buy it (I have a 26 lb. dog). However, that's just a small suggestion. I'm really happy with this product.",dogs,3

"Assembly and cleaning is not that difficult if you just follow the manual. The manual even has directions for cleaning the pump. The product does get noisy if the water level is low, but to fix that all you have to do is get a glass full of water and pour it into the bowl part of the product, which I do about once a day. This takes maybe five seconds and is just as easy as filling a regular bowl, only the water gets filtered through and is always clean and debris free. The other thing to do about noise is to lift the dome and slide a finger along the pump to clear away any hairs and debris that may have gotten by the carbon filter. Again, about 5 seconds of work. As for getting the water to flow over the entire dome, I've found that adding extra water to the bowl after replacing the dome along with rubbing your hands over the dome helps a lot. If you do these things this product should work just fine. I have had mine for three months, clean it once a week, and have had no problem with spilling, parts breaking, or my cats not liking it. Just as with anything though, you need to take care of it, but that part is relatively simple.",cats,2
I love this thing! I have neighbors with an aggressive alpha pit bull. Every time I'd go out into my back yard it would come running and slam into the wooden fence and try to fight with my dog through the fence. Within 3 days I had the neighbors dog and mine trained to stop rushing the fence. You must use it as part of the training. Just pointing it at a dog doesn't do the trick; you have to back it up with a verbal command. It does indeed work on cats too! I love it!,dogs,3
"I've been using this product for almost a year. My cat is very food obsessed. Before getting this, he would meow at me and bug me to feed him all of the time. Now, he just continues to paw at the magical giver of food close to meal times. Since the feeding times are consistent, he has a pretty good idea of when it will turn. Originally he pawed at it obsessively all day until he figured that out. He has never once managed to open it despite trying *very* hard. He can spin it backward to the empty compartments, but it never deprives him of his future meals when the time arrives. When it gets very close to meal time, he is often able to push it open to the next slot, but this is only possible about 15-30 minutes before the scheduled time.I would urge anyone who gets this to read the directions carefully and completely. When I first read them, it seemed complicated, but once you understand how it works, it's a breeze. I would also encourage people to use it for awhile in a supervised capacity before relying on it to work while you are away for an extended period. I use mine all of the time, so I have confidence that it is set correctly when I will be out late or am away over night. The battery life also seems very good. I usually change it before vacations for my own peace of mind, but it has never actually gone dead in regular use.This is a very useful product that ensures my cat gets consistent regular meals, despite the twists and turns of my daily life. It has been a dream separating me from the food in my cat's mind.",cats,2

"It's hard to fathom how Littermaid could produce the LM900 & LM950, both terrific products, and follow them up with a piece of garbage like the Elite Mega. Our Elite jams daily, even when only half-filled with litter. If you fill it with litter to the ""full"" line, the rake can't even get through the clean litter. If one of our cats should actually use the box, forget about it!A few specifics:1) The drive motor is clearly not up to the task, and is very noisy.2) The controls are electronic, which means that the slightest AC power glitch will leave the unit powered off. This also clears the clock and any ""downtime"" you may have programmed in.3) There is no ""cycle"" button; the only way to get the unit to cycle is to power it off and on again (see point 2).4) The ionic air cleaner appears to be little more than a green LED.

This may not seem like a big deal but it did cause litter to scatter. Also, there's not a big enough area for the cat to do its business, so you can't go without cleaning for more than a day like you could with other boxes. But it was very easy to use, and I didn't have a problem with it being flimsy. This could be the right product for you have enough space and time to clean it.",cats,2

"I was having great difficulty maintaining the Ph level in my aquariums. I had tried frequent water changes, putting shells in them, and other pieces of advice you find on the internet. Nothing worked. It was around 6 to not measurable by the test. Then someone at my LFS said to use this, and it fixed everything! I was hesitant because I don't like to use chemicals in my tanks other than Stress Coat to dechlorinate during water changes. I have not had an issue with ammonia, nitrites, or nitrates since I started using this, and the Ph levels are rock solid. I tried to fix the other chemical levels for about a year, but they straightened out after I leveled the Ph. I actually use less than the directions call for and test weekly to maintain it, but I never put any in except at water changes.I let it disolve in a cup while I am doing the water change. Otherwise particles will float around the aquarium until they dissolve. Some users complain about the phosphorus causing algae growth, but I love plecos so this is never a problem for me and I can't really say if it does!",fish aquatic pets,4

"I am disabled and at first I was pleased with this machine. It worked fine for about the first month then the clogs and the stench started. No matter what I did from scrubbing with lysol to cleaning once a week the cat genie had a horrible smell to it. The plastic harbors the smell and you can't get rid of it. The granuals also hold the smell in. Ya it washes everyday and when it is drying your house smells like Cat Crap soup with a Perfumy cover. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It will leave your pocket book broken, your nose smitten and you house guest going OMG what is that smell.",cats,2
"This product has been very effective. We have a jack russel/rat terrier mix who doesn't bark, but jumps and likes to chew things. It only took a few days to break him of being in things he shouldn't be, we still have some problems with chewing on stuff, but that has improved as well! After all, he is only 7 months old and it takes time to train. But the product does work well. We do have to use the large prongs for it to work on him, but he has a thick coat too.",dogs,3
"I was very excited to receive this item since my brother has one for his dog and is constantly singing its praises. Unfortunately, the first one I received from Amazon had a broken bottle so I returned it only to receive a second one, also with the bottle crushed. So they both went back and I decided I'd just go to the local pet store and buy one. When it's not broken it works wonderfully!",cats,2
"Our Vet recommended this for our newly adopted dog, who had scabies and other skin conditions from being at the shelter. Within two weeks, his skin and coat was much more healthy looking and within a month, his coat was super soft! We add this to his food every morning and he seems to love it. I'm sure it had other health benefits, but we just love what it's done to his coat so far!",dogs,3
"After researching this product and talking to neighbors that own this system,I purchased it for our strong-willed puppy. This is the best invention EVER for pet containment. We live in a VERY mountainous area with a sloping lawn and woods. Initially I was concerned about some of the reviews regarding hilly regions-We have had no problems with this issue. Training the dog with the flags and the warning tone was a little difficult because the tone is very quiet (especially with leaves crunching, the dog panting and the wind blowing...). We tried to train the dog per the instructions, but he just wasn't connecting the tone to the boundaries. Finally, after 5 days of pretty much playing near the flags, we decided to unleash the hound and let him learn by trial and error. It took one quick ""ZAP!"" and he immediately learned his boundaries.It broke my heart to see our dog jump off all 4 paws with the initial shock, so of course I had to try it on myself to see if I was being inhumane (or to see if my dog is a drama-queen). Turns out the shock snaps you to attention, but it feels more like a static shock-Not painful and not long-lasting. We did notice that if the collar is near the refrigerator, it starts beeping and will shock...so I would suggest taking the collar off immediately upon re-entering the house and turning the unit off.If I could improve this product, I would do two things",dogs,3
I have two huge turtles and have gone through so many filters and never found one good enough until we got this one. It works great and keeps the tank clean. I got one bigger than recommended which I would suggest if your using it for turtles bc their much dirtier than fish. It easy to set up. It's pretty quiet but I wouldn't suggest it if its going to be in your room,fish aquatic pets,4

"It is exactly as it was intended to do. Once on, the dog will try to take it off but realize that it can't. Not being able to use his mouth, the dog most likely calms down and takes a nap. Barking is at a minimum. I am very happy with the item.",dogs,3
"I bought this after a trip to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, where I took a class in cat grooming. They used these almost exclusively and raved about them. My cats enjoy being brushed with these much better than the wire brushes, because they're soft enough to go over the joints and backbone without poking or scraping, yet they are excellent at pulling out those loose undercoat hairs. I have a shorthaired cat who throws up hairballs regularly and regular brushing with the Zoom Groom has greatly reduced the number of surprises on the floor. The only thing I would caution is that if your cat (or dog) likes to chew, put this out of reach when not in use! I had a foster cat who happily chewed the ears right off of this! :)",cats,2
"I bought the Furminator with a very skeptical eye. I figuered it wouldn't break the bank so give it a try. I have a Corgi, thick undercoat, sheds like mad, especially in spring and fall. I decided today to give it a try. First pass over his coat I knew I had struck gold. In about 15 minutes I had gotten more loose fur off him than I used to get in at least an hour of hard work grooming wth other tools. Saved my back a lot of grief by getting it done so fast. It didn't do much for our short haired cat, I really think this is for thick undercoats. I am so happy that I will be able to keep my puppy looking his best without having to run him to the groomer constantly and spending a lot of money. Thank you Furminator.",cats,2

"I have 2 adult cats that needed to increase their water consumption, and any vet will tell you a good fountain is the best solution. My cats are VERY drawn to the running water and the clear reservoir on the back lets me see how much they are drinking. This fountain is well designed, easy to fill, has great capacity, and is nicely quiet. Its a little difficult to clean without the Drinkwell cleaning kit, so you will want that immediately. I also like the 2-stage filters you can use with it to ensure your pets get uncontaminated water.I needed a way to ensure my cats got lots of water, and this fountain did the trick and then some!

"I love our two Golden Retrievers, but keeping up with the shedding is a never-ending battle. I purchased the large FURminator as well as the FURminator deShedding Shampoo. The FURminator did the best job of pulling out the undercoat I have ever seen as well as doing it with the least amount of effort I've ever used. Terrific invention. The FURminator deShedding Shampoo is unbelievable. It is a coconut base shampoo with plant proteins, herbal extracts, Vitamin E, Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids, aloe vera and plant extracts. From what I can tell, it seems to be formulated with all natural ingredients. The directions say to leave it on for 5-10 minutes before rinsing. I was not thrilled with the prospect of trying to keep shampoo-lathered dogs from shaking lather all over the bathroom while this stuff sat for that amount of time, but both of them did really well. First off, the shampoo smells incredible. The dogs even seemed to like it. Secondly, among the herbal extracts are Calendula, Chamomile and Kava which may explain why they were so calm during their 10 minute wait. Last, but not least, they both looked absolutely beautiful and smelled fantastic when I was finished.I highly recommend both of these products.",cats,2
"We have a 7-lb. chihuahua who loves to burrow in her bed. We were lucky to find two Petmate beds in a local pet store over the last several years but couldn't find another until we found these on the web. We ordered two of the navy blue ones to replace our other well worn ones. They are made almost identical to our old ones, except that the lining is a little less sturdy (our chihuahua likes to dig into her bed) so the lining is already losing a little body.Other than that, the beds are great. After I remove the stuffing (which is accessible via a zipper) I clean the beds in cold water wash and dry in low heat (although the directions say to line dry) every time I bathe our dog. I have not had any problems with shrinkage caring for them this way or this often.Even though we live in Texas, our winters can get cold enough to send our little chihuahua deep into her bed at night. I don't know how we could get along without these beds. Before I found these beds on the web, I was getting ready to make my own beds using the old ones as a template. Luckily, I found these beds at a great price. They are well worth it.",dogs,3
I gave this to my English Bulldog for his 2nd birthday and he loves it. He carries it around all day and always pokes his paw in the holes to feel the ball inside.

"I ordered the Merrick lamb lung treats on the advice of a dog agility friend who had great success with them. My dog has been blowing her contacts in agility trials, and my friend suggested using these special treats ONLY when training the dog walk, A-frame, table, and see-saw. After just two training sessions, my dog is once again racing to the contacts and sticking them. My fingers are crossed that this behavior will carry over to the trials, but with the help of a clicker and these apparently very appealing treats, I'm seeing renewed confidence and enthusiasm. They're expensive, but are a bargain compared to the wasted trial entry fees and travel costs. I'm also going to use them as I begin very basic obedience training with our new rescue dog.",cats,2

"I hate to admit it but I've been just going to my local pet store for their free water tests for the last year or so. They use those stip tests. One problem is that they aren't as accurate as a kit such as this. Another problem is that if you feel there might be a problem with your tank, by the time you get to the pet store the next day and get back home, everything in your tank might be dead.This kit comes with incredibly simple, easy to follow instructions. I was a little nervous about the measurements of the chemicals but the bottles have a dropper top (sorry if that's not a real phrase) that is amazingly accurate and forgiving. My first attempt at checking all 4 levels went smoothly, and I was impressed that my tank was just about perfect. Now I can test every week for the next four years (my kit has an expiration date of 4 years from now, meaning I'm paying less than $5 a year for this).If you're worried about dealing with chemicals or worried that it might be complicated or difficult, have no fear. If you can microwave popcorn, you can handle this kit.",fish aquatic pets,4
I now have 2 of these Kitty Pads. One was purchased about 3 years ago and is still working perfectly and my cellar cat (Cheddar) loves it.

So basically I have a back up for the one used in the cellar if something should go wrong with it. Highly recommended.,cats,2

To be fair our dog was still under a year old at the time , but we found it the other day and tried again, but of course we never repaired it from the initial damage so again had to put it away. If you have a smaller breed dog , or an older dog it may be fine , we were shocked at how durable the material for this was so only exception is for the ends.",dogs,3

"This collar is easy to use and is very effective with our Labrador. It is much easier to use than our old collar, purchased several years ago for our other dog, and the actual collar unit is smaller and less cumbersome on the dog. The battery lasts for about 3 days before needing to be re-charged. Charging the collar and hand-held unit is very simple. The only drawback is that it takes about 12 hours to charge it, since we do a lot of RVing, powered by the generator when we are away from home. It has a good range with ample settings (tone only or tone & zap, and it is nice that the collar is water-tight. I chose this collar because of the ease of use and the range that it covers.",dogs,3

I placed it in an area that they traffic a lot, and the room is not super-big, so I'm sure the &#34;smell&#34; would have reached them. One of the cats (the aggressive one) did seem to react when he got close to the diffuser by wrinkling his nose up, but that was it.I would definitely not buy this again, especially for the outrageous price.",cats,2
"I absolutely adore this toy. The catnip is potent, my cats loved it, and it's just plain adorable. The only problem is that my cat who has claimed it as his is a MAJORLY rough player. Within a few hours of arrival, he had chewed into one of the ends, making it a bit gross with a catnip/cat saliva mix. The toy is still usable for now, but if I let him play with it for too long, he starts gnawing at the end and it will soon break completely open.I recommend this toy if your cat is less of a maniac than mine is!",cats,2
"Our 5 year old male cat started going out of the litter box after we adopted a puppy. We tried all sorts of things to get him to stop and this litter was part of ""Project Last Resort"" at our house. As I was pouring the litter in the pan he was instantly interested. He immediately climbed in and scratched around. We have 2 cats and I had 3 litter boxes, each with a different litter. I wanted to see if he had a preference. He immediately started using this litter and ignored the others. As a human, this isn't my favorite. The clumps are heavy and sometimes stick to the sides and bottom of the pan a bit. There is no deoderizer so when you scoop you will smell cat pee but I'm not noticing a smell in the room or anything. It's also a bit dusty. You will need to scoop at least 1 time a day and wash the pan well occassionally too. Experts also say you should replace the pan every now and again since they absorb orders (you should do this with all litter). The Elsey website also says to completely replace the litter every 3 - 4 weeks. But, the fact that my cat uses it makes me a convert. It might not work for everyone but it's sure worth a try!",cats,2
its sturdy and has a simple design which makes it economic and affordable it was kind of difficult to assemble as the instructions left too much room for guessing and it make sure you have 2 people assemble it because its extremely hard to keep the sides vertical while adding the top panels. other than difficulty assembling it has been great its huge so any dog bigger than a lab is probably gonna be comfortable in it and even our little shi-tzhu tucker finds himself comfortable in it with tons of extra space can't wait to see how our giant schnauzer takes to it though.,dogs,3
"I've been using this product for about one month. I installed it myself using a trench digger which I recommend (save yourself a fortune). My dog, a (now) 7 month old Great Dane puppy has, so far, been very receptive to this product. She was shocked several times throughout the learning process, a prospect that I was not thrilled about, but understand is necessary to learn the boundaries. She is now approximately 100 lbs and will not go outside the yard for toys, bikers, walkers, other dogs, etc. I was very surprised how quickly she picked up the concept. I do recommend going to Lowes and buying 14 gauge wire (&lt;$50) as I don't have too much confidence in the small 20g wire it comes with. The last thing I want to have to do is have to try to find a damaged/corroded wire and replace it. So far, I have no regrets about this product.",dogs,3

"I bought these about a month ago because we have a few cats that we occasionally have to give pills. It worked for 2 of the cats but the other seemed to sense that something was ""fishy"" about these things and wouldn't touch them. But for the other two cats they worked great.They are like a semi-moist cat food, but more moist and pliable. There's a little indentation in the middle and you just push the pill inside and squeeze it together. The cats seem to pretty much swallow it whole, or if they do chew it, don't notice the pill inside. If it were a very bitter pill I probably wouldn't use these since they'd probably be able to taste it. Anything that gets medication down even 2 of the cats without a struggle is a success as far as I'm concerned.",cats,2

"One of our cats really loves to chase the jingly balls. Unfortunately, she would lose most of them under various bits of furniture within a day. This toy lets both of them bat around a ball all day if they so wish. The scratcher is also a great furniture saver. They used to sharpen their claws on the post and on the wicker. Now they just use the post and the cardboard scratcher. Your cats may vary. The cardboard scratch pad seems to last a decent amount of time. Each side seems to last a little over a month with two cats.",cats,2
"There is no substance to this product. It is as thin as a towel and provides no comfort for your pet. I suppose it might be preferred to laying on tile; but if you have a rug, your dog will probably prefer the rug to this. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about. This should not be considered a bed. It is simply a large piece of material with a cheetah print on it.",cats,2

"When I first came across the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box I thought it might be a litter box that would actually perform as advertised. It was a simple yet effective looking design so I ordered one to try out. I have had the litter box in use for almost week now and so far the box has worked flawlessly. My wife and I own two cats (10-12 lbs. each) and they instantly took to using the Omega Paw after I tossed the old Littermaid box that had long ago become a manually scooped receptacle.We both work long hours so the litter box is typically tended to twice a day. The box works exactly as directed, just roll the box over, tap the bottom to dislodge anything that might cling to the box itself, and roll back giving the box an extra shake/tilt the other way to redistribute the litter. The waste is neatly captured in the slide out tray and then dumped into a lined bucket with lid we have for containment. The first few times I would pop off the top and check on the performance. The litter has thus far been free of any missed clumps and as clean as or cleaner than it would be if we had repeatedly scooped and sifted with the hand tool. The older of our cats has a tendency to not squat down to urinate and the box has contained his poor aim allowing the clumping litter to do its job.The box is big enough for most cats including our older and larger male. He managed to partially miss outside the box once but I suspect that is because of his old age (minor arthritis/stiffness in back hip?) and a lack of familiarity with the box on day two. If anything, I believe this box will minimize his mishaps compared to our other boxes.I would recommend the box to anyone who needs a quick and effective means of cleaning a litter box with minimal waste contact. I don't worry as much about getting dirty when scooping before work because this box works very well. The covered box does a good job of containing litter and odor. The cats have also tracked out less litter since they have to step out of the box more than the old one. The one thing I plan to do is to spray the inside of the base with a non-stick litter box spray during out first thorough cleaning to help keep it cleaner, longer.Some reviews mention the clips that hold the box together and so far they feel fairly strong when sliding open/closed and I don't anticipate any problems with them. I plan to update my review in a couple weeks and will share any relevant information regarding their durability. So far, I have no hesitation giving this product a 5 star review and strong recommendation for cat owners looking to minimize time spent cleaning up after their cats.",cats,2

It took me a minute to understand how to use it but basically when it's in front of you, you tip it all the way to the right, almost upside down, and all the the clumps fall into a long shaft. You pull it out (in the picture, it's the tan thing with a handle) and dump it, and put it back in.I purchased the regular and it was a little small for my Maine Coon but he uses it just fine. If you have a cat that's bigger than 15lbs or so, or is really fluffy, I would get the large instead.",cats,2
"My 10 month old Golden loves this toy. He enjoys pulling out the eggs from the shark and then ""munching"" on the eggs. The eggs are a nice shape and size i.e. just fits in his mouth but not too small so that he is in danger of swallowing them whole. I would have liked the seams of the shark toy to be stronger and the lining made out of tougher material. The poor shark was torn in less than 15 minutes!",dogs,3
"This cage is sold as both a chicken coop and a rabbit hutch. (for the coop, Ware adds a perch While I've never been a fan of keeping a bunny in a small hutch, If it has a run to play in, this does add good security during the sleeping hours. However, I personally utilized it as a an add-on piece to an existing coop to give the rescue birds a bit of a mini mansion. This large hutch, I should note, is bigger than I expected.I attached it to the back of an existing coop, made the attachment predator proof, and utilized it for more nesting boxes.So, let's touch on what makes this good for either rabbits or chickens because the positives and negatives relate to either creature.Assembly:Super simple. Couldn't be easier.Stability:Impressive. Many hutches have thin wires that raccoons and other predators can actually bite through. Using my long handled wire clippers, even I could not cut through these without EXTREME force. No way could any animal bite through this except perhaps a shark and if those are in your backyard than wiring is the least of your concerns, after all. I had to clip some of the wires to create the attachment of my two coops. Also, you can't see it from the picture, but just above that metal tray that slides out for cleaning at the bottom is a heavy wired bottom above it for double protection on the bottom. However, don't leave a chicken or a bunny on wire, of course, put down bedding. not cedar bedding incidentally, many don't realize those fumes actually can cause long term liver and kidney effects on your pets. Use pine or straw)Access:The top is not only hinged, but of course you can reach through the front door as well. It's easy to reach in through the top the way it opens.Off the ground:Prevents mice from smelling the food and water and gaining access.Negatives:Those are the things I love about it but there are things I changed. For example, your pet is TOTALLY a victim of all elements. Heavy rains can come in sideways and there is no way to get away from it. I am in Texas and I put this outside and noticed there wasn't one bit of shade in it in spite of it's size...the sun came in through 3 sides, filling the entire hutch with brutal heat. Why brutal? The top is also dark and absorbs heat. But all this can be fixed.I added Siding part way up (only part way so there is good air circulation and venting from the ammonia in any wastes) on 2 sides and I added nesting boxes. Now rain cannot flow in and there is ample shade.You can get sheets of tin cut with tin snips and screw them on or you can just use square pieces of wood.Ideally if this wasn't under shade I would also put a tin roof on it to reflect the sun rather than absorb it with a sheet of styrofoam under the tin to insulate it. However, my chickens have access to a coop built this way so I don't need to do it for this piece as well as it's only used for laying eggs. You can just cut the tin sheets you get cheap at a hardware store with tin snips, put the styrofoam sheet under it, and screw on.This is not raccoon proof by any means but you can make it so. Raccoons love chicken and rabbit so most hutches are built to keep them out. A raccoon can get in a trash can with a bungee cord tied around it, a latch on it, and a heavy rock on top of it (trust me, I know from experience) so this is almost a raccoon invite. You need to add a latch at the top that can't simply be turned to open it. We added a latch with a key lock and just leave the key in during the day, and leave it hanging on a string attached to the lock at night with with latch locked. If a raccoon knows how to use the key dangling in the lock, then that is one genius coon and I give it props for outsmarting me but I dont expect that to happen.Also, you would want to add a spring lock at the door access. Again, simple latches are opened quickly by raccoons. They can't access the spring locks.This only takes a few bucks and a few hours and ensures no one's heart will be broken to find a defenseless pet maimed in the morning from one of it's most common predators.I have another wire coop by ware and the wiring holes are smaller which I prefer. No raccoon paws and no snakes could fit inside them. Snakes could get in here, the paws might be doubtful but I still wonder. but my provisions of adding sides and hideaways inside prevent any tragedies.Incidentally, I got mine 1/3 of the normal price because a site called Critter Cages got some in that had a tiny bit of breakage on one of the sides, easily fixed. So I scored big. But even at the normal price, I think the hutches are made very well as long as whatever is inside gets mostly outdoor run or free range time. Nothing should be in a hutch most of it's time; it stresses the pet out and results in fights between 2 or more pets inside them.Conclusion",bunny rabbit central,1
"I chose this specific sand because of several factors. The price was comparable to other sands and gravel (minus play sand, of course). It claimed to come packed with live, good bacteria to help with cycling. It requires no rinsing. It buffers the pH, and it's an attractive sand.After reading all that, I thought it would be the perfect choice. Both processes of rinsing sand and cycling tanks are not things that I ever look forward to, so I was very excited when I found this sand.The tank has been set up (with sand) for a month now. Initially, the tank was quite cloudy for maybe five days - with an old filter running on it. The claim ""doesn't need rinsing"" led me (and probably many others) to believe that the product wouldn't create a cloud-fest in your tank.The live bacteria claim is a joke. The tank still isn't fully cycled. I should have remembered that the bacteria requires aeration and a source of ammonia to stay alive, or at least refrigeration. Not going to get much of that packed in a water-tight bag.The pH level is fine, but I can't say for certain that it's the sand doing it. I have tufa rock in the tank as well, and I've heard that water in my area is naturally higher in pH.The sand does look nice, and after the tank is established, it's not a bad product. The few mbuna that I have in there now love digging out pits between and under rocks. But the product's initial claims are a little far-fetched.",fish aquatic pets,4
Have a Boston Terrier that will make just about any toy into garbage. This ball is holding up very well. Try a tennis ball once and within two min he had it torn up. He tried doing the same with this ball and couldnt. He is around 20lbs and glad I went with a 3inch size.,dogs,3
"I have a Welsh Corgi, otherwise known as a shedding machine. Another Corgi owner told me how well the Furminator worked on his dog, so I bought one. The Furminator removes undercoat VERY slowly, as in hardly at all. My curry comb was one-third the price and takes out undercoat about five times faster. My advice is to save a lot of money and time with a curry comb and slicker brush.",cats,2
"I have a very good brush I have used on my cats - a fine toothed rake which gets lot of loose fur. I used to swear by it, until someone let me use this JW blade. The cats like it better and it gets more fur faster. The ""blade"" actually has small jagged teeth and the cats love it, even on their tummies. You can swipe much faster and it gets more fur with each swipe. The best part is that it doesn't ""clog up"" like the rake brush, which I have to clean every few swipes to get the fur out of it.",cats,2
"I have two senior dogs and they each have a Midwest Life Stages crate. Our dogs were never crate trained. As they got older, incontinent and a wee bit senile we needed to find a way to keep the dogs and the house safe when we couldn't be there. These crates were the perfect solution.1) Super easy to fold, and lays down flat, no hardware needed... vacations have been much less stressful with this crate. It fits perfectly in the car folded up. I no longer worry about messes in hotels of the homes of friends and family.2) The molded bottom cleans up quick and easy.3) The size of these crates are amazing. My lab/dalmation mix has room to walk a few steps, turn around, have room for a small water bowl and her bed and still leave a sizeable area of the crate floor clear just in case she needs to go. If she has an accident she still has a clean spot on her bed to retreat to. When i get home I only have to clean the crate bottom, not the crate AND the dog.4) We also used this crate with the divider when a friend with little dogs visited. Each dog got one side of the crate and it's own door and had plenty of room.Definitely recommend!",dogs,3
"I really do think this is a wonderful product, and the time it takes to clean it is drastically reduced from scooping. My two male cats have no problem with using it, however my female cat stands just inside it and pees on the outside. I do not know if it is too small for her (I did get the large) or if she is just daft (I honestly think that is the problem!). My male cat is actually bigger than she is and he uses it fine. I do have a second box that is the old covered style and they still use it as well, but the Omega gets used much more frequently. So, overall, I would recommend this box as a product to make life easier without spending a ton.",cats,2
I've been through three of these and all failed at the hose connection to the waterer. The design should include some sort of stress relief bracket or support at the hose connection point.,cats,2
"We adopted a feral cat and bought this thermal mat because it can get cold in the garage (which is where she lives). It makes a tiny bit of crinkling noise when stepped on, but she wasn't bothered by the sound at all (even though she is feral and still a bit skittish). The mat is made of plush, cozy fabric and is machine washable. Our cat loves the mat and hardly leaves it on days that are a bit chilly. It seems to really work because she also has a pet bed and a bed made out of blankets in the garage and she seems to prefer her mat. Definitely worth the price.",cats,2
"I will admit, I was skeptical about this product but due to the great reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did. I have four dogs and work from home. Naturally, these dogs are my pets and love to sleep in my office. The problem had been that they would erupt into barking at any movement outside. My office has two windows on the front side of the house so there was frequently something to bark at. Of course, once one starts, they all get crazy and are completely unruly to quiet down. I previously found myself trying to yell louder than their barking which is complete insanity. Anyways, since I got the Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer, that has all changed. They no longer bark like a pack of lunatics. In fact, I beleieve, they are much better behaved overall. I have used this product only a few times on the dogs. They now know when I show them it, not to bark. I praise them profusely when I know they really want to bark but aren't because they know the ""doggy mute button"" will be their consequence. In addition, I have found I do not need the full 1-2 sec tone. I just quickly press and release the button and that is enough. It is really great because you appear ""silent"" to the rest of the world while you are correcting your dogs behavior. It has truly been a God send and I would highly recommend this product to anyone with behavior that needs correction. Just make sure you still give your pets lots of praise for their good behavior and you will be thrilled with the results - I know I have been!",dogs,3
I wasnt very impressed with this item. It seemed to make a difference for about a day. The dogs stopped and looked around to see what it was. And overnite they didn't care that it was there. So I'm back to square one...,dogs,3
