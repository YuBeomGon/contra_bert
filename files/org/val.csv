My dogs go ahhhh.. after their bath. Works wonders to calm the obsessive itch. I have a Bichon with sensitive skin and a Chihuahua with an obsession to chew her feet. Not issues any more! This shampoo really works great!,dogs,3
This cat litter absorbs odors and clumps much better than most. When pouring into the litter box it creates a large dust cloud. Price is cheaper here than other retail stores but still expensive.,cats,2
"Absolutely worthless. Barely picked up any hair. And the gloves are too small for me, very difficult to get on.",cats,2
"These nail clippers work great for my medium-sized dog. I also very much like that these come with the nail file and quik stopper. The file is comfortable to hold and works well. I haven't made my dog's nails bleed to date, so I can't comment on the powder stuff. I just wish it came with extra blades!",dogs,3
"One of the best cat toys i have seen in years.Just 2 issues with it which i knocked a star off for.Could do with a way to make it weight more, it slides eveywhere when i cat even touches it on a wooden floorOther one is why glue stickers down on the centre bit which is cardboard which you have to use a knife to get it off leaving chunks in the cardboard where you done ityou can't go wrong with it your cat will love it",cats,2
"In the absence of real bones, our miniature schnauser gets a daily Greenie which helps keep his teeth white and breath fresh. For that, they are worth the price.",dogs,3
"Because the prongs twirl when going throught the fur, it doesn't pull it as much. More comfortable for my great pyrenees and goldens, and thus easier for me.",dogs,3
This tool is amazing. It removes the loose hair more quickly than regular combs or brushes.,cats,2
"My cats love this. I bought it when they were just a few months old, and they are now 10 months old and still play with it every day. In fact, if they are getting into something they shouldn't be getting into, I distract them by rolling the ball on the track and they will run in and start playing with it. They also use the scratcher regularly, and I routinely sprinkle it with catnip. I definitely got my money's worth with this one.",cats,2
"Living in the country with three dogs and trying to keep them in the yard was nearly impossible. I thought about a chain link fence,but have a lot of rock under ground and I do mean rock!!! We decided to try this unit instead of the wire one again because of the rock.It took about three days with the worst of my dogs,a beagle that love to roam to get her full attention and she has been in the yard since. My other two a Cairn Terrier and a curbstone sitter seem to catch on faster.There may be certain things that interrupt the signal but not as far as we have seen. When my Beagle see's a Deer as close as 40 feet from the bounty and won't go after it,I can defiantly say it works very well for me.As far as recommending it ,I would highly say yes!!!!!Have owned this unit 1 1/2 years now and even my neighbor is amazed at how good it works.My daughter has one for her Lab and two Boxers and they have no problems with the dogs leaving the area.If you do not have an area where you can not install a wire or just want a portable unit I highly recommend this unit. It is very easy to install and works as well as the wired units.",dogs,3
"This product is a must-have for pet owners! It gets rid of stains and odors really well. After house-training a puppy and dealing with several of my dog's stomach viruses, my carpet still looks fine!",cats,2
"We love the dog park but let's face it, it's a gross place to play (probably only gross to us humans). My dog loves running around and has now been taught the wonders and joys of mud. Although I have a seat cover in my truck, I still like to take one of these wipes and give my dog a quick wipe down. The wipes pick up a substantial amount of dirt and they smell decent enough. My dog isn't too thrilled about them but she doesn't have a say in all of this. I'll definitely buy more of these.Pros:Thick, large, not too heavy on the fragrance, easy to dispense.Cons:I did not buy more the first time around.",dogs,3
This is a great product. Easy to install. The dog loves it and it looks good in the car. The fabric is light and durable and it is very convenient to uninstall it and wash it. I wasn't sure if it will stay in place but it does very well. Our car has leather seats and the seat cover also protects the leather very well,dogs,3
"I was getting ready to send these back and filled out the information for Amazon. I noticed you could buy a large size, so I thought there were two different size Andis blades. Not the case. These don't snap on like the package says, they slide on. The directions are incorrect and you must attach the two metal snap hooks to the bottom of the blade and then use your thumb(s) to slide the comb forward and along the top of the back of the blade until it snaps onto the teeth. It is actually simple once you know. These appear to be of high quality and made very well, so I expect these to last as long or longer than the clipper. I gave it one star because the idiots that sell these have not addressed the incorrect instructions on the package, nor have they modified the Amazon site to rectify the issue. I will change this review if they ever get a clue.",cats,2
Was too small for my Blue and Gold Macaw so I returned it but will be ordering a large one from the same company. You can't go wrond with Booda products for birds and the price is right!,birds,0
"Great flow rate. The cord is short, but an extension cord made up for this easily. The number of fittings which came with the pump was fantastic. No problem connecting to my prefilter and the 3/4 PVC outflow.",fish aquatic pets,4
I have three different kinds of Eheim filters and this one for the price is the best of the three that I use. It is easy to set up and also simple to maintain. I would suggest this filter for the beginner or for someone who is looking to set up a 60 gallon aquarium. Eheim filters are very well constructed and have a solid reputation in the aquarist community. I will only use Eheim filters from now on.,fish aquatic pets,4
This product was prescribed for excessive ear wax by my cat's veterinarian. It costs a little less to buy it over the internet.,cats,2
"We tried PetSafe as a cheaper alternative to putting up a wooden fence. However, our backyard is a rectangle with neighbors close by on either side. To give our dog full access to our backyard, the system also gave full access to the neighbors' yards. When we lowered the setting to keep the dog out of the neighbors', then she only had access to a small portion of our yard.Furthermore, we only plugged in the unit to test the boundaries. Everything else was unused. We've tried repeatedly to contact Promax to return this item and have received no response from them at all. I will never buy anything from this company again.",dogs,3
"We purchased this product because we live in Winnipeg, where the winter temps go down to -40 degrees Fahrenheit and we needed a large enough bowl for the use of feral cats when we go away. This product works quite well. Some ice has formed above the surface of the water but there's still plenty of ice free surface for the cats to drink from and it's been very cold recently with lows of -10 deg Fahrenheit. The water does not evaporate as quickly, too, which is a good thing when you're going away for a few days so you can fill it up only once every 4 days or so.",cats,2
"I ordered the XL bed for my 60 pound Golden mix. The bed is plush and looks very comfy. The only bad thing is after being in the bed about 45 minutes, she gets hot and starts panting. She moves somewhere else to cool off and then returns later. We keep the house around 70-72 degrees. I would love to figure out a way to make it cooler for her, but no ideas yet. However my 10 pound Maltese mix will sometimes sneak a nap in it. He looks like a stuffed animal in the giant bed :)",dogs,3
Ive typically never had to use flea medicine cause i use natural products to avoid. however we moved to a new apartment and our dog was infested within the first week. This product was Easy no mess and the fleas died!,dogs,3
"My cats love these - they would do just about anything to get them. When i had one cat who was injured this is the only thing he would eat. I know they aren't nutritionally complete, but at that point we were pleased if he ate ANYTHING.",cats,2
"I'd purchased a Martha Stewart sweater from Petsmart in size XS for my four-month miniature Schnauzer. And while it's very cute and fits well, I needed something that would provide more warmth. I read each one of the reviews and even though there were a couple negative ones the positives far outweighed the negative. And, the price was right. I purchased a small, and while it's a little big for my puppy, the velcro straps adjusts well so it's a good fit for her with some room to grow. It's so cute, very well made, and she loves wearing it! Great buy. And there's also an opening for a harness hook.",dogs,3
"I first got these treats from my vet. My puppies loved them. The Lean treats are small and a great size for training. Being that they are lean makes them healthier for them.I have a tendency to ""over treat"" so by giving them the Lean treats I am at least treating them with a better treat.I order these all the time.",dogs,3
"Price was right, product is top quality. Received quickly in time for our new puppies' stocking! Will purchase this type item again.",dogs,3
The furminator came quickly. We were amazed at how much fur came off our chocolate lab. I think he felt much better too,cats,2
"We have a 65 pound, very stubborn dog that will only listen when he wants to. We had put him through obedience classes and while I think they were great he only listened to commands when it was convenient for him. This product has changed all of that and he is now very obedient. The first time I used the product I had to turn it up relatively high before I ever got a response from him (6). But after only one time of zapping him at that level I have never had to zap him ever again. Now just the warning sound and he will listen to any command I give. He does get scared when I put the collar on him but it is just a mental thing and I hope to break him of this. So I would take the advice of others here and put the collar on 1/2 before and 1/2 after a training session and do fun activities with it on so your dog doesn't associate the collar with negative feelings.I like the quality of the product as everything feels really sturdy and doesn't feel like it will break. The fake-leather collar is sturdy and very adjustable. I like the option to only give a warning message as I don't want to zap my dog. The charger will charge both the collar and the handset at once and no batteries are needed (This is essential). I don't have any battery issues like other people have reported and the charge seems to last forever.",dogs,3
"The cat didn't like it. He normally loves fresh catnip. He did not like this variety. He just ignored it, creating a void between us that spans wider and sinks deeper with every passing day.",cats,2
"I was skeptical but desperate when I purchased this item. However, after the first day there was an obvious reduction in the frequency and pitch of the barking from the three obnoxious yippy dogs next door. I even slept in the guest room which is closest to them to see if it lasted throughout the night; it works!FABULOUS!",dogs,3
My 3 yr old lab enjoyed this but was able to hold in paws and tear pieces off within minutes,dogs,3
"This is a product I use all of the time and Amazon wants me to write a review so here goes . . .This works and it's great, no fleas or ticks on my dogs. WOO-HOO!Got it fast, will probably order from here again.",dogs,3

"I am so happy with this cat litter.... I have tried absolutely everything in my quest to find a silica free cat litter that isn't loaded with perfumes and that works well. I think that World's Best delivers on their promises. It clumps beautifully, is flushable, is not harmful to breathe, and is not harmful to my cats when they clean themselves. A lot of people complain that this has absolutely NO odor control. I don't agree, but you MUST clean your litter box AT LEAST once a day. The heavily perfumed clay litters may be more forgiving with regard to daily cleanings, but really....do you want your cats to scratch around in a box filled with poop and urine for days on end?? They will track that all over your house! People also complain about the price, but guess what? That cheap clay litter throws off silica dust that YOU AND YOUR CATS breathe in. Look up ""silicosis"" and then rethink using clay litters. I've also tried pine litter and that stuff tracks all over the house and is a royal pain to clean up...and talk about no odor control. Same problem with newspaper litter",cats,2
"It's simple. It's useful. And the home and office have been accident-free since we got it. Also, people think it's hilarious that my dog uses a doorbell.",dogs,3
This product stopped functioning after about 6 months of usage despite all instructions having been followed to the letter. I resent paying good money for an unreliable product... explore alternatives before opting for this brand!,cats,2
"I would caution against using this product for more than a few months because it stops working. I had been using it on my 3 cats and noticed that after about 15 days, the fleas would return in full force. I did some research online which showed many other reports of Frontline no longer working, and when I called the vet they also suggested we move on to another product.",cats,2
"We had recently gotten a female German Shepard and found her at the bottom of our driveway one day after we had been playing with her and then got side tracked with something else. Right then we decided we needed to buy a fence to keep her contained because we don't like to hook our pets out. We were searching for a fence of some kind and came across the petsafe fence. We are so glad we found this!! Shelby can go out and run in the yard and she know's where her boundaries are and stays in the dooryard. With twin sons in the Air Force being deployed, their wives and dogs came home to stay with us, we bought 3 extra collars and they are all safe. A special feature is that if it accidentally gets unplugged or we lose the electricity the collars are deactivated, and the ""Girls"" do not get shocked!!",dogs,3
Several years ago I bought 2 leashes that adjusted to fit around your waist. They worked well but since the webbing was one long piece it was difficult to adjust them to fit my small dog. By the time it fit my waist it was a bit short for reaching my dog and not have him so close he felt like he was going to be stepped on. I came across the Buddy System and I love it. The waist strap adjusts independently of the leash length. I also love that the leash portion can move along the waist strap so if your dog gets a bit behind you he doesn't tug on your waist as bad. I also love that you can add a leash and that there are lengths for big and small dogs. I also love the extra buckle that comes with each leash so that when you let your dog off leash you can clip the other end onto the belt and not have it dragging behind you. It's the perfect hands free leash system!,dogs,3
installed the product to hinder my cat from opening the front door and run on the street. When it approaches it gives a beep but that is all what it does. The cat walks past it smartly and some times sits near it. It seems it enjoys the noise it makes.Am somehow disappointed coz it did not give the effect i intended to have.,dogs,3
"A friend of our's had one of these at the creek we take our dog to and he was going absolutely nuts over this toy. We bought him one and he loves playing with it. I'm worried about him chewing it apart so he only gets it when we're outside on the lawn or at the creek. He goes nuts over the squeak noise that it makes, you can throw it end over end on the lawn and it really bounces which he also enjoys. It floats in water, just be sure to drain it when you're done for the day otherwise I'm sure the inside would rot. To drain it you have to hold it straight up and down and squeeze the bottom and the water will come out of the squeak hole.",dogs,3
This pool is a perfect size. It is easy for all crabs to get in and out of and looks like a real pool! The diving board and palm is a bonus!!,fish aquatic pets,4

This bag was great for airplane travel! It fit perfectly under the seat in front of me with a tiny bit of room to spare. I was concerned it was going to be a little too tall but it was perfect! The dog was very comfortable and loved looking out the sides while we were in the airport. It was nice to be able to put the sides down when were on the plane so he knew it was time to go to sleep. It is even stylish! most people didn't even realize I had a dog with me! All in all this was a great purchase! I would recommend this bag to anyone looking to travel with their pet!,dogs,3
"I've used these clippers on both my dogs for the past three trims and would recommend them to friends and family. The safety feature which only allows you to cut the ""safe"" portion of the dog's nail works well for most size dogs although for our miniature poodle even the safety guard was unable to fully protect the dog's quick and required our normal increased attention while cutting her nails. The clippers thus far have been sharp and cut our dog's nails quick and effectively, and for the majority of dogs should work excellently with its built-in safety.",dogs,3
"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. Put this product on my cat as directed. She seemed confused, didn't play as usual or eat or take her usual nap. Just happened to check side effects of this product and found an incredible number of people who lost their pets to this POISON. Luckily I had enough sense to wash it off with a mild soap and she seems to be getting back to her normal self but I won't be satisfied until I'm certain she's out of the woods. WHY HASN'T THE PRODUCT BEEN TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND WHY IS AMAZON CARRYING IT?!?@",cats,2
"Eukanuba is junk with crap ingredients. They have good marketing and packaging to make you think it is high quality when it is actually the exact opposite. The same can be said for IAMs. Eukanuba gave my perfectly healthy boston terrier skin problems which although weren't his cause of death, it was the first domino that led to his death. If I had not fed him this junk, he would still be alive today. Im not a random case. The problem is byproducts, fillers and the use of corn. You mind as well feed your dog alpo and save yourself the money. No dog food should contain byproducts,soybean or corn.",dogs,3
"Outdoor cat loves it. Thick walled,bottom snaps together, place for screws but fits good without.Bought K&N 1032 heating pad with it, then had to order a fleece cover. Room for cat to lay beside the pad if he gets to hot. Cat didn't like cord for the heating pad coming out the door, so i drilled a 1 inch hole in the side near the bottom. The plug just fits through, dicovered the walls were thick maybe one-half in or more thick. It is not too big for one cat looks good on the porch,very sturdy.",cats,2
"The toy is very rugged - Star hasn't been able to rip it open yet. One thing though, the squeaker is very hard to press and barely makes a sound, so she loses interest in it pretty fast",dogs,3

"After reading several of the favorable reviews, I decided to get the GripSoft slicker brush, model #65002. My Lab/Aussie mix and my German Shepherd love this brush, they actually wait for their turns to be brushed. The soft rubber cushion the brush teeth are set in and the bent angle of the teeth are set so there is less of a chance to prick your dogs skin. This brush gets a lot of the under coat off my dogs and their fur looks great. I am so pleased with this brush that I plan on buying another for later use.",dogs,3
"My dog loves this, she always bring it to me, its a nice weight and shape for her to catch my perfect touchdown passes!",dogs,3
"My Lab made quick use of this toy, and had it skinned before 24 hours passed. In the time it was one piece he loved it. Made for dogs who cherish thier toys...not those who kill them.",dogs,3
"I bought this litter box a few weeks ago and my biggest concern was that my scardy cat who hates change would reject using a covered litter box after 14 years of using an open box. She took to it right away and it has been an awesome upgrade for me as an owner and designated litter box cleaner. My first litter box was one of those $100 Litter Maid self cleaning litter boxes....it broke down right after the warranty ran out. I bought a second one and it broke down before the warranty ran out so they sent me a third one. I was so tired of it I continued using broken box #2 never even opening the 3rd new box, instead I chose to scoop the litter and place it in the Litter Maids storage compartment until full so I would only have to empty it once per week and keep the smell contained within the storage compartment.Now I have the Omega, my hands never touch a scoop or messy storage compartment lid anymore. The box is sealed well so no litter gets out during my cats use or during the rolling process during cleaning. It is so simple and clean I wish I had invented it! Now I still don't want to carry cat waste out to my garbage can twice a day so I have created my own weekly storage container for the Omega like my Litter Maid had built-in. I went to a Dollar Store and bought a $1 plastic pitcher (The kind you put drinks in to pour into drinking glasses). I pull the top off and put in a pair (double layer) of those plastic grocery bags we all get piles of from grocery shopping, the way you would line your garbage can, and I place it near my cat's litter box so each time I roll it and have waste in the tray I pour the waste into my waste container (drink pitcher) and then place its top back on to contain the smell. It works great, no smell, contains enough waste for a week of single cat use so I only have to throw it out once a week, and my hands never come close to touching waste or litter. The litter box itself also cuts down on dust compared to my old open box, it seems to be more efficient in its use of clumping litter compared to using a scoop in an open box, and my cat even seems to track less litter out of the box because she has to walk out through a hole rather than leap out like she did in an open litter box. For those of you who have cats who like to launch litter across the room rather than lightly scratch litter around while in in their box then you'll pretty much appreciate any closed litter box. In my opinion you will love this box and at a sale price of $33.25 for a large box with free shipping it is a no-brainer.",cats,2
"Life's Abundance customer service is very rude and will not help customers who have purchased or wants to purchase their cat food.Shipping is too high. When inquired about shipping, they were so rude and told me ""if you want our cat food, you need to pay its price on shipping."" $50 worth of cat food resulted in $30 in shipping.It won't surprise me if all of these reviews were written by the company. This is a very shady company.What happens if my cat has an allergic reaction and customer service won't help?TERRIBLE CAT FOOD, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, TERRIBLE COMPANY.",cats,2
"This particular product didn't do anything for my 3 indoor cats who sporadically got fleas. The fleas loved my kitten and he was covered. We washed them and applied the product and the fleas were back on the next day. The next time around I bought Frontline Plus from Amazon and that worked right away. I don't know if this was an old batch or maybe the Plus made a difference (although I thought it just protected against ticks as well) but either way I wouldn't buy this one again. I only spent a few more dollars for the ""plus"" version and it was worth EVERY penny.",cats,2

"I don't know what it is about these little plastic toys but my kitties go crazy for them. They get so much joy out of flicking them and chasing them all around.

Better safe than sorry. 5 stars though, they love them!",cats,2
"After watching my 82 year old mom drive with her little poodle in her lap, I bought this seat for the safety of both of them. I selected this seat because it seemed to be the best car seat for the price. Her 12 pound dog can stretch out in comfort now. It also gives her dog height so that she can look out the window. The dog had some issues with car sickness, but for some magic reason, that problem has gone away after she started riding in the seat. There is an adjustable strap included that can be snapped to her coller so that she has room to move around but cannot jump out of the seat. It is perfect for what it was purchased for.",dogs,3
"It's a miracle! i have tried everything over the last ten years,halters,chokers,harnesses...nothing ever worked. I have two large,strong dogs 112lbs and 68lb who pulled me off my feet on a regular basis.This amazing product has changed everything! I can walk normally instead of getting dragged...they are forced to remain at my side, not in front of me. I actually look forward to walking my little monsters now.It took a few days to get them used to it, but they did and now we are all very happy.",dogs,3
My lab does not try to take the squeaky balls out he just likes to play with the animal itself and carry it around. It's not a very big toy I was honestly expecting bigger but its small/medium sized.

"My cat was entertained non-stop when I first gave this to her. She literally tried to hug it and rub her face into it for hours (because of the catnip). I showed her how to move the ball around and she got the hint quickly! She played with it so much that I had to hide it at bedtime so I could sleep! She doesn't play with it as much now, but she does use the scratching part almost daily.",cats,2
"I did not have a problem with the solvent smells that others have described, and I'm pretty sensitive to those kinds of smells. I have a Honda CR-V and it fit very well.

"My cat loves this hidden kitty litter and knew what is was for straight away. To avoid any confusion going from a standard open kitty litter to this one, I left the lid (plant part) off for a few days so he got used to using it before I put the lid on. The top goes on easily however you have to line up the top and bottom where the hole is otherwise it could be tricky (I am glad I read all the reviews on how to easily put the top back on this way). To make cleaning easier I found a circular pot plant saucer the right diameter and use this with a kitty litter liner. Makes cleaning so quick and easy! I am happy with the overall appearance and it's great for our small apartment with not many options of where to place the litter. I thoroughly recommend the Good Pet Stuff Hidden Litter Box.",cats,2
"My boston loves this thing, perhaps too much. It is a ground-level wrecking ball made of hard, painful plastic. It will destroy garden fences. It will pulverize flower beds. It will make you hate life, but your dog may love it... In spite of bloody gums and scratched eyeballs, your dog may love it. It is like heroin for my dog. It is really bad for him, but he is addicted. Somebody needs to make a kevlar/rubber ball like the old kickballs, but puncture resistant.",dogs,3
"The last straw was the day my 13 year old Cattle Dog ""claimed"" the presents under the Christmas tree and the tree itself. I ran down to the pet store and they had one large size left in stock. These really do work, especially when used with a poise type pad. I like that they have elastic around the sides to help snug up the fit. I'm ordering a couple more today so that I always have a clean one ready. Granted, my dog is really patient while we get him strapped in... This would be a tough job with a squirmy dog. I just wish there were different colors.",dogs,3
Im a college student and i needed two couches for my apartment. well the ones i could afford were very good looking cosmetically however the fabric cushions and couch smelled of old pee.

Also i sprayed the whole fabric couches with alot of spray and allowed them to air dry. The couch has no residual smells after 3 months of use and they are perfect.

"My 6 year old puppy LOVES this toy! She is a crazy Sheppard mix, 60 pounds and full of energy. I love finding toys that challenge her and keeps her busy for a while without my arm having the toss something every 30 seconds. At first she didn't know what to think of it and got a little frustrated that she couldn't get to her treats, but after a few times with patience and encouragement from mommy, she turned to a pro! She plays with it so much and understands to stop tipping it over when all the treats are eaten. She got a little too good and now I have to dilute her treats with dry dog food. Best treats for this toy",dogs,3
"This container works great for dry dog food storage. Because I placed it inside one of my lower kitchen cabinets I had to turn it over so it would fit in front of the upper shelf.

"I have a 40lb lab mix, and she's ""small"" in comparison to a full grown lab, but definitely not a lap-dog. I was on the fence about getting a medium or a large bed for her, so I erred on the side of caution and got her a large so she could stretch out on the fabric (which is a cross between outdoor rug/lawn chair strapping) without hitting the support bars. My pup is extremely picky, so I had to call her onto the bed, but I have had it for over a week and she has been getting onto it on her own to relax or take a glorious nap in the sun. I've left it outside, despite a few torrential downpours and it looks no worse for wear.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it was actually hard to get all the screws in and maintain the form. I'm not kidding. Four college graduates, of which 2 were strong men, an engineer included. Its definitely not coming apart and its structurally sound when all four legs are on the ground, but when you pick it up to move it, the joints are flexible. I'm not sure if perhaps that's by design - to adapt to uneven outdoor ground? That's what we decided...",cats,2
We have one of these at home and our new little rescue dog feels very comfy in it.We ordered a second one to keep at our beach cottage so she would be comfortableThere as well! She loves to nap in there and goes in on her own when she wantsA break from from the crazy humans! Sometimes I think she would close the door herselfIf she could!,dogs,3

"This product is super if your dog is fully charged. It is a giant wrist rocket that can really launch a tennis ball. Much farther than the average Joe would want to.My dog is crazy and my only complaint is the surgical tubing blows out fast. Man , I have shortened it up and even went through a whole new set from a friend. I am going to order a 50 foot roll of tubing because this wrist rocket is deadly accurate with round ammunition. It is more deadly than my bow and just as accurate. You would not believe the power.",dogs,3
I have an apricot toy poodle and after only two weeks I could start telling a difference.It has been about a month and a half and her eyes look wonderful!!! No more stains. Thisstuff really does work. I bought some can dog food and mix it in with about a tablespoonof food. She thinks its a treat. I haven't had any problems with her eating it. I woulddefinitely recommend Angels Eyes!,dogs,3
"I didn't know whether to purchase the 4 or 8 panel pen, but am glad I decided on the 8-panel. It is much higher than the 4-panel, and is very versatile. It assembles easily and when we need to open it up to clean up if our puppy has an accident, it's easy. At first I thought, gosh, it's so high, we can't climb over it. However, just slide out one of the posts, and then just slide it closed temporarily while removing any soiled papers. Our puppy has her crate within the pen, so when I need to clean the pen, I just put her inside the crate, and remove the paper, walk out, and reinsert the post. The doggie door is great, it has two latches, both of which have a small screw on them to tighten it so little houdinis can't open it! And once she is trained, it will be a great room divider, and we can use it in two different sections. It's so versatile that way, and can be flexibly set up in an octagon shape or rectangular shape as well, however you would like to configure it. Or use just 4 or 5 of the 8 pieces, depending on your needs. All around a terrific deal, I've seen it for $129, thank you Amazon!",dogs,3
"I didn't read reviews, just purchased in store. Puppy would check it out but NEVER used it for potty. Even used spray on it. No use! Surprised because I had great respect for simple solution. Maybe they should read these reviews and pull this product.",dogs,3
This is the greatest thing sliced bread! The plaque on my dogs back teeth has started to come off in chuncks since I've been using these wipes. She does'nt mind these as much as the toothpaste. I started with twice a day and now do the cleaning only once a day.Love this product!,dogs,3
My akita is an extremely finicky dog. He is hard to train with food since none of the treats I buy seem to please him...until I got the Exclusively Dog Best Buddy Bits Peanut Butter Flavor Dog Treats for him.

"This litter is great so far it does not stink after use or turn to jelly. I have two cats. My one cat developed a urinary issue and it has drove me insane. It started when I decided to change the plain rock dust litter to a cleaner type. I used the paper pellet type because it was not dusty and seem cleaner, but it was perfumed though my one cat got sick from it, and so I tried best cat the corn litter that was a no go the other cat was allergic.*** Since starting this a few days ago ""Precious Cat"" herbal litter both cats like it, theres no perfume smell, no symptoms of allergies and I hope my one cat gets well soon from this urinary issues!***Great product!!!!",cats,2
"I live in a condo and have four cats, two of which are elderly and somewhat fussy about their litter boxes. Obviously cat litter performance is important to me with four litter boxes in a small space.World's Best Original has always worked without a problem for my cats and I. There's a grain smell when the litter is new, but it's not unpleasant - it's just the smell of dried corn. The corn smell dissipates quickly, and controls cat odor well throughout the duration of its use. It clumps great, and flushes without a problem. I use it in conjunction with Nature's Miracle enzymes, and there is no evidence of smelly cats. And believe me, they are the smelly kind.If you are having a problem with your cat using the litter box, try slowly switching to World's Best little by little. Add it in gradually over a period of time, and the cats aren't likely to notice.",cats,2

"I replaced my real old filter which was amazingly quiet with this new one. It seems to work great but just a bit too loud. My tank is on the second level in the living room so the noise does not bother me at all. I will use the noise to my advantage. My old filter was so quiet that I could not know if it wasn't working or had stopped unless I walked to the tank. Now when this one stops, I will know immediately that something is wrong. From what I have noticed, If you have an aquarium in an area where you need some quiet, this is not for you.",fish aquatic pets,4
"KEEPS CATS HAPPY & KEEPS THEM HEALTHY. A+Excellent product, I have had it for nearly two years now.With two adopted feral kittens (now both nearly 3), I had a few tasks at hand to say the least. One of them was that the cats wouldn't drink water out of a bowl without putting their paws in it and splashing it all over the floor first. Fun times.Enter the Drinkwell Fountain.Boy cat LOVES to lick from the waterfall and Girl cat happily drinks from the bowl area. Both, quite noticeably, drink more than I've ever seen cats drink of still water in a bowl.They are healthy and happy - and I am happy! While it takes a little effort to clean thoroughly, so what? It's a great tool. I clean usually every week to sometimes (with the help of the CARBOR FILTER) every two weeks. I also appreciate the filters properties to ensure clean water.After some time I acquired the 50 oz. RESERVOIR on the end so I never have to worry for more than a few days that they won't be able to drink up to their hearts' content.Maybe some day when the motor kicks the bucket I will try the next level up if it is quieter, however I hope for some years to come to keep enjoying my current Drinkwell!",cats,2

"These lids are made more cheaply than the nice set I got at the dollar store. the dollar store set also has cute raised paw designs on them. When the store ran out of them I bought 2 of these sets at Amazon, and I don't like them. They all have ""Spot"" written in raised letters on them. I have a cat - not named Spot. They also costed me more than 3 times the price of the ones at the dollar store.These fit only the 5.5 oz. cans of cat food, not the 3 oz. cans. I don't know about dog food cans.",cats,2

"I ordered this product because I thought it was the same product I saw advertised on HSN. HSN was out of the product so I came to Amazon.com. I don't know for sure if this is the same, but I didn't think it was everything they said it was. I read over 40 reviews that said that it ""instantly and permanently"" removed odor. I think that it removes odors to a very good degree, but I don't think that they are totally removed. I had a problem area with my dogs. I used this product... quite a number of times on the same spot... I can still smell it. Not as bad as before but the high hopes I had of it vanishing permanently... not there. I am not saying that it is not good... just not as good as they said. At this point, I am wondering if there really is any one product that can make anything vanish completely? I probably would not order more of the same product, although I went and ordered two huge bottles in the first place. Maybe try something else next time. For the claims that it totally takes away cat urine smell, which is worse than dog urine in my book... it should have taken away the doggie urine smell totally... it did not.",cats,2

Both work great for odor control, and the super scoop helps with clumping and tones down the ""corn"" smell.Visiting family have actually asked if I still have my cat, which I find encouraging.

For about 6 months the product is a God-send. Especially if you use the premium scoopable litter. Nice smell and clumps in a way that the box ""likes"".

"Two or three months ago, I subscribed to this company for automatic delivery of their dried chicken ""breasts"" each month. When this month's order arrived, I allowed my Golden Retriever to eat one only. Within a short time he became severely ill and continued vomiting repeatedly throughout the entire night. I am a retired attorney/judge. I do not become hysterical over every complaint that makes a claim that some product or other can kill your pet. Now, I greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item. Had my Golden been weakened in any other way, I do not believe he would have survived this incident.My on-going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish. But I trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken ""breasts"" would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed. Such was clearly not the case. In fact, it appears that the only action the U.S. distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the United States. Closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the U.S., it continued to be imported from China.Amazon is by far the best retailer on the Internet by far. My complaint is not against Amazon. But I feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered (and he did suffer). I can imagine other pets who are smaller, older, or in some other way more vulnerable than my Golden, would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product. It's true that this was not the case every month. Rather it is an intermittent but on-going problem.I cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is. It is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the U.S. once and for all. Please Amazon, end your involvement in this matter.",dogs,3

I have been amazed at how durable this scratcher is, especially considering that my cats attack it with such zeal on a daily basis. Finally after all these years, my kitten managed to get to the catnip inside. Although the toy is now disemboweled, I still can't bear to throw it away - if possible, my cats love it even more. No matter what other toys I introduce to them, my cats always come back to this mouse. I will, however, be buying a second one that looks a little less rough! :) For such a great scratcher that lasts and stays a favorite for so many years, this is a great product.",cats,2

These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog. They love these and sit waiting for them. They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth. There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.

The first time we left her in the hotel room she broke the side zipper; the second time she broke the front zipper. Finally, she tore through the mesh and now it is unusable. The crate is great for traveling, but if you have a bigger dog than my Cav, I would suggest buying something else.",dogs,3

"This is the second of these boxes I've bought from this company. They are extra large and the entrance is high, which is perfect for larger cats who have a habit of hanging their rears out the ends of lower entrance boxes.

"I hate to give such a negative review to a product that has been great in the past, but after talking with my vet Frontline just doesn't work anymore. Apparently, since it is the oldest of these topical flea and tick preventatives, the bugs have just developed a resistance to it? I went through two doses and the fleas were only getting worse. So, I definitely don't recommend anybody buy this product. I think it still works in some areas, but it certainly did not work for me in the South.",dogs,3
"I thought another reviewer was crazy for complaining about the smell of this toy...and then I got it in the mail. I have to say, it kind of makes me feel nauseous. It has a weird, sickeningly sweet smell that won't go away. I'm kind of worried about giving it to my dog, who so far, seems to like playing with it when it's filled with food.Otherwise, it works great. It is harder to get food out of the squirrel dude than Kongs, which is good and entertains the dog for a longer time.Unfortunately, I'm afraid to handle the thing because of the smell!",dogs,3

"I originally bought the Kyjen eggs all by themselves to see if my dogs would rip them apart or not, and I was amazed that they loved the eggs but didn't rip them up. I think it has something to do with the size of them, they sit perfectly in the mouth and they're a bit hard to get a hold of with their paws to rip them up. When the platypus toy with the eggs went on sale, I jumped at the chance to get the dogs another exciting toy.Two out of three of my dogs actually like toys, my oldest doesn't have any interest at all. The other two just adore the platypus! They take it with them everywhere, from room to room, out the doggie door, all around the town. They sleep with it, eat with it and rest their heads on it. It's a definite keeper. So far they have not removed the eggs from the toy and I'll let that happen in it's own time. The directions tell us humans to pull the eggs out and put them back in while our dogs watch the process and then let them figure it out by themselves, but I think my dogs will be shocked and thrilled to figure it out on their own. The toy comes with two extra egg toys on the side for use at another time or to play with by themselves. (three eggs in the toy) Besides being a wonderful amusement for dogs, this set of furry objects is priced right and made extremely well. I am so happy I purchased this and will go back for other Kyjen products in the future. The eggs alone make fabulous stocking stuffers for friends' dogs as well. Thanks for such an intuitive, creative, entertaining gadget for my canine babes !!",dogs,3

I am very happy with this clipper. My dog is thought to be a Miniature Schnauzer mix; she has slightly thick hair, and this clipper does a wonderful job.

I also spray it in the room and when I want my cats to feel more comfortable. I decided to order the several bottles of the spray at a time as its cheaper than in the pet store where I discovered it. Time to reorder again!",cats,2

"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package.",cats,2
This is an awesome idea but too small. My bigger cat had allot of trouble not peeing out the door or into the window. My smaller cat eventually rejected it and started peeing outside of it. They never liked it - I think they felt claustrophobic.,cats,2

We bought our first Chuck It four years ago! We still have it after thousands of ball tosses. We have a large yard and it really sends a ball flying. We just bought the small one for our 18 month old baby girl. Now she can toss the ball to our dog too!. The smaller one is probably nicer if you have a small yard as it does not throw nearly as far.This is good if your are not very mobile. You can use it from a chair. It is easy to get the ball if you can't bend or have trouble bending.Do not hesitate to buy this. It is worth every penny. Never having to touch a slimey ball and a product that won't break! What else could you ask for.,dogs,3
"I've been buying this line of products for years. We have pugs and they don't do well with large hard treats. These are perfect. They are soft and very small so it's not an issue giving multiple ""cookies"" as they are low in calories. And of course the dogs love them.",dogs,3
"I first saw this litter box in the Skymall magazine and was tempted to buy it at a higher price. When I found it on Amazon for a lot cheaper, it was a no brainer.

"Despite being a longtime customer of Amazon and frequent buyer, I rarely take the time to write a review. I only write reviews if the product exceeds my expectations or if I am trying to save a potential buyer from wasting their money on an inferior item. Well, I'm writing this review to warn you that the ""Best Ball"" (known as the Almost Indestructible Ball when I bought it) is flat out AWESOME! Forget the name change, your dog will go nuts with this toy and never break it. It is simply the best $12 that I have ever spent. For your dog to enjoy playing with a tennis ball or Frisbee you have to throw it to them. And footballs, basketballs, and other air filled balls bust; however, the ""Best Ball"" does not assistance of a human and it can be a fun activity for your dog to enjoy anytime it chooses.I ordered the ""Best Ball"" in 2007 for my monstrous Boxer (aptly named Zeus) and immediately upon throwing the ball over the gate he was all chasing it all over the yard. Unfortunately Zeus is no longer with us, but the Best Ball was his favorite toy and he played with it everyday, and he played rough! I now have a new dog, a Rottweiler named Bear, and like Zeus he loves the Best Ball and despite wreaking havoc on it for 2 hard years it's still in great shape sans for the discoloration and cleanliness. Point blank, the ""Best Ball"" is amazing and truly indestructible.So let me sum it up",dogs,3

"This clipper is nice and sharp and easy to use, and the light is easily angled any which way you could want it. However, if you are interested in this because you have a pet with very dark nails, its not going to help. The light is VERY bright, and remains cool to the touch, so if you need a little bit of extra help to be sure you don't nip the quick of your pet's nails then I recommend it.

"Run your wire pattern first, test it, then get a rough cut wood saw. Cut through the grass to about a 2 inch depth, leave blade of saw imbedded to this depth, bend blade to one side and force wire down into earth/grass shoots. Work along only as you are cutting and burying wire. Takes a while to do, but seems to be the only way to get under this type of lawn!",dogs,3

"My cats do not play with this ball. They simply push it with their nose, walk a little bit and get food. It is not an exercise ball by any measure. If you make it too hard for food to come out, they will get bored and stop using it. If you make it too easy, then it is not really exercise-just a free for all. If you want to watch your cat work for food and appreciate it, get one. One per cat. Otherwise, one cat will do all the work and the other will swoop in and steal the food.",cats,2
"I bought these sheets as a precaution to cover areas of my carpeting underneath corner furniture in my kittens' room, so that they would not have any ""accidents"" on the carpet.Well, these sheets stuck onto the carpet and have been in place for six weeks and still retain their stickiness. I have even seen a small collection of balls and cat toys stuck to the sticky sheets over the weeks, but I can not say for sure whether they could be credited with deterring my kittens from using those areas instead of their litter boxes, especially since I just observed one of them half seated on one of the sticky sheets and licking it! I just removed them!",cats,2
After reading all the rave reviews about this product I was hopeful that it was as good as it's reviews. The sifting mechanism takes up about 1/3 of the box. The latches are cheap and difficult to lock and unlock. I tried several different brands of litter and found that they all stuck to the bottom of the box requiring me to take it apart frequently. Litter spills out od the cracks as well. I eventually removed the sifting screen as it kept popping out and didn't function as stated anyway. I gave it 2 stars only because it's so large with the divider removed it's a better fit for a very large breed cat like my Siberian Forest cat. It's an interesting idea but it just doesn't work.,cats,2

"I have a golden retreiver who is ALL ABOUT his toys...he is obsessed. Frequently he'll have 1 or 2 toys in his mouth and kick around another one at the same time. But of the dozens of toys we have this ball is by FAR his favorite. He had another ball that he loves, but he likes to sit with them in his mouth and just chew, which eventually made the other ball split. So we had to find another one. I tried 5-6 different balls before we found one he loved as much. He would kind of play with the other ones, but didn't really get excited with them. And then we found the tanzanian mountian ball. We now have 5. He LOVES LOVES LOVES LOVES LOVES this ball. He can chew on it all day long and the only damage shown are some indentions in the rubber from his teeth. No splitting, nothing. And keep in mind this is an 80 lb dog with a LARGE mouth, and this ball is just bigger than a tennis ball, so it fits entirely in his mouth. We keep multiple around because no toy keeps him entertained like his ball. For my dog this really is the best ball ever. Holds up great. keeps him entertained for hours, and that's saying something since he's just a year old and quite A.D.D when it comes to entertainment!",dogs,3

"My 12-yr-old cat has been indoors since age 6 wks. His mom was feral. He never did adapt well, & would hide or run when anyone approached. Even me, the feeder, if I didn't do it right.He got worse after hurricane Katrina, and spent about 6 months wedged behind a bookcase. Any loud noise or unfamiliar person would send him scurrying.About a month ago, I saw a program on telly that featured a cat much like mine. The ""therapist"" advised the owners to use a pheromone spray on themselves and to spritz the legs or feet of guests. When the ""therapist"" revisited, the cat was calmer.Well, it seemed worth a shot. I ordered the diffuser, since that seemed more polite than spraying down guests.I saw results in about 8 days. The cat began staying in plain sight more, and would jump on the sofa, and even asked to be petted. He also began grooming more.The acid test was when he didn't scurry when my husband entered the room. That was revolutionary.This is a product that I'll continue to use.",cats,2
Cat's really enjoy this toy. They go crazy to play with it. It is durable and comes with refills. A must have for cats.,cats,2
"We were a little nervous about the concerns we saw posted before we bought this product, but went ahead and gave it a try. We couldn't be happier. Our cats have become more enthusiastic drinkers, especially our female cat - who was not fond of drinking water. She used to have problems ""straining"" in her litter box, but the extra water she drinks has solved the problem. We have also been able to cut back on the higher calorie wet-food she was eating (to try to get more moisture in her diet) now that she drinks more.We thought the filters and the cleaning kit might be a rip-off. I don't know how much the filters actually ""purify"" the water, but they certainly help prevent hair and food clogs, and allowed us to go longer between cleanings. Likewise, we found cleaning to be quite easy with the kit. The brushes are just the right size and it only took 5-10 minutes. I can certainly handle that every week or two.The noise hasn't been a problem either. We have hardwood floors, so we put the unit on a towel. If we remove the towel, it makes a slight hum as the motor vibrates against the floor. With the towel, all we hear is the sound of the water running. (You have to expect that, right). We got the extra reservoir, so we can go a couple of days without refilling.With minimal effort on our part, out cats now have something that makes them happier and healthier.",cats,2
"On the plus side, my dog adores these (but then again she adores just about anything that isn't a mushroom). But, on a Jackie scale of 1 (delicious) to 10 (super-duper-climb-on-the-counter-yummy-delicious) this appears to be an 9.03. She Really Likes These.For a training treat, they will break up easily. For a snack in the dish, they are not messy (even when A Certain Dog runs away with it in her mouth to munch down elsewhere). It is a quick snack though, definitely not a chew.Some dog treats are stinky or disagreeable, but these are not...except that in the old packaging (the photo still up on Amazon) it is NOT clear this is a lung treat. My husband is having a severe case of 'yuck' over these and I would not have bought them if it had been clear, but in the mean time, the dog gets to enjoy this bag.Speaking of the packaging, it does appear to have changed. The Merrick website shows this treat as having a recall, but what arrived was NOT part of the recall (it was a theoretical risk, no ill dogs reported). The new packaging also makes it more obvious it's a lung product.Overall, recommended, but do not be surprised by the Lung content and by the change in package. I am taking my dog's word for it (so to speak) that these are quite delicious.JTG",dogs,3
"This cage is a lightweight but sturdy cage. Built right with high quality materials. The doors work great and with the addition of wheels as an option, it is very easy to move around. Watch out for smaller dog feet getting caught in the openings just below the gates.

I would certainly buy another one the next time I am cage shopping.",dogs,3
"I bought this to replace a regular 6ft leash. I got the medium version rated for 77 pound dogs since my dog is about 50 pounds and likes to pull. The retractable mechanism works really well - smooth and doesn't tangle. The 16-foot length seems just right where the dog has lots of freedom but you are still in full control.I'm glad I got the all belt version. This protects you from cutting your skin with the thin cord, feels stronger, and in my opinion looks better.The only problem I have with this product is that the handle is slightly too small for my hand. For reference I'm a 5'11 male. The grip is good size but the opening is a bit too small. It's not a serious issue but could be improved.",dogs,3
"I don't usually write reviews. However, I decided that I really need to describe my experience with this product so that you can understand why some people give it 5 stars and some give it 1 or 2 stars. I have two Persian cats who will use almost any litter. So I decided to try this because of the commercials and the reviews on this site. While the litter does a decent job at first of clumping and covering urine smell, it does nothing to knock down poop odor. Also, it needs to be changed very frequently to cover up the urine smell. For the first time in the 11 years that I've owned my two cats, my house actually reeked from the smell of the litter box. Even my cat sitter (who is a vet tech and helps me out when I need to travel) begged me to go back to a clumping clay litter.Don't ignore this post - I don't have anything to gain other than to save you money and the annoyance of determining that you need to get rid of this stuff.",cats,2
I bought three bottles of Thyro-Pet on a 3 for 2 price deal. I used 2 bottles giving the highest dosage. Had my dog tested and the results came back as low as when he was first diagnosed and before he was on any medication. Obviously the stuff didn't work at all. I sent the test results and TWO bottles back to the company. They only gave me a refund for ONE bottle. They refuse to refund the second bottle claiming I got that one for free. I fulfilled their return requirements but they still won't give me the rest of my money back. After many emails and phone calls I gave up because you can't get past the switchboard or the person on the computer. DON'T BUY FROM NATIVE REMEDIES! They will rip you off.,cats,2

"Got these for my tennis ball obsessed Border Collie. She tears through them fairly quickly since she likes to run with them in her mouth. She's fairly picky about what other balls she uses, doesn't like any tough rubbery Kong-type balls. This one is soft enough for her to enjoy, and the two in the yard haven't gotten torn up even though they've been left out and used constantly for the last month at least. Will probably stock up a few more for when we lose these, they get torn up by the lawn mower, or they finally give in (hey, nothing can last forever).Update 2/13had these for a number of months now and they've held up well through the winter. They haven't goten hard or tough as some plastics/rubbers do when they're left in the cold. My collie runs with these in her mouth. She's not really a chewer per se, but they do get a lot of action, I'd say probably 5-6 hours a day of use plus a few times a week of intended fetch use. I haven't noticed any signs of wear, other than some dirt and the surface getting rubbed smooth in a few areas. Definitely would have gone through dozens of tennis balls by now, these have more than paid for themselves and I expect to have them around for at least as long as I've already had them. Maybe I was wrong; maybe these can last forever.",dogs,3

He was very thin and he was an outdoor cat. I thought that if we boosted his immune system he may have a chance at a better life. After a few months of Vetri-DMG each day, he plumped up! He had strength, energy, weight gain, and was HAPPY! This cat went on to live for several more years. I purchased this product again for an outdoor kitty and had good results as well. I would recommend this to anyone who's cat or dog (or bird) has a compromised immune system and needs a BOOST.",cats,2
"I was buying the cheap flying discs online for a dollar each in cases of 48 for a long time. My 90 pound Doberman Pincer learned to catch with them. They flew quite far but often she would snap them in half when she caught it midair resulting in sharp edges. In the winter, they would snap upon landing from being so brittle (kept in garage). I bought 2 Hyperflite Jawz discs about 18 months ago. They are much heavier to throw. You will need to train! After a few days I could get them just as far as their cheap counterparts. My dog loved being allowed to keep it in her mouth and gnaw on it when she took breaks between throws. Could not do this with the cheap discs nor with the name brand Frisbees (like butter). The glow in the dark version is great at a local school yard playing field paired with her orange light up collar.I'm back to purchase 3 more; one is lost for good and one was left alone with the 90 pound chewer. She didn't destroy it, but managed to pierce it in a few places so off to the trash it goes.Advise on color",dogs,3

He is a big, bold cat who loves to explore and this was just the purrfect fit for him. He gets fresh water when he wants it and will seldom use a regular water bowl any more.My girl kitty (very shy), still prefers a regular water bowl, which I have in another location for her needs.For me, there are no downsides, you just need to take the fountain apart about every six weeks to clean it out and change the filter.",cats,2

My dog had a bad reaction to this device. The first time she had it on it seemed to do nothing and she barked as usual. Gradually her barking lessened but she barked once loudly and then began screaming. We tried again the next night with the same problem. This morning we gave it one last shot and after having the collar on for about 5 minutes she began screaming yet again. She had not even barked. She had been playing quietly and the collar shocked her anyway! She kept screaming and hopping around and when I finally got the collar off of her it was warm.,dogs,3

"After my second.. ahem.. ""name brand automatic litterbox"" gave up the ghost, I decided to try something different for my little furball.First impressions were that it was larger than what I was used to, and didn't feel as ""solid"" as my previous litterbox. But, lots of positive reviews made me give it a shot, and boy am I glad I did!The litterbox is quiet! No more wraaaaaaaagh in the middle of the night to announce when my kitty left a present, no more drum against the bottom of an empty collection bin when the rake dropped the clump into it. But, best of all.. no more.. ahem.. ""flying kitty presents"" when the rake clears a blockage and slingshots the mass across the laundry room.For those switching, a couple pointers.1) Plan on the first ""fill"" to take most of a 14 pound box/bag of scoopable litter. With the other brand you filled below the line, here you fill ABOVE the line.2) While the design of re-using grocery bags is cool, do yourself (and your kitty) a favor and get some of those scented or odor blocking bathroom can liners. They are thicker and help to control the smell.3) Your cat may not take to the box right away. Don't panic! Either unplug the power and scoop manually for a couple days, or put some of his/her old litter in it. If your cat leaves you ""presents"" elsewhere, just pick them up and drop them in the litterbox. Once the cat smells it's leavings, he/she will get the idea and start to use the new box.I'm glad I took the chance on this product, and will be recommending it to my friends and family.EDIT - Not all is well. Had the unit for 4 months and both motors have burned out. Finally gave up and ordered a ""normal"" litter box. Maybe we haven't been out of the trees long enough to design a reliable and clean automatic litter box?",cats,2
"I was extremely skeptical about buying this toy for my 3 cats. My two boys are not that active, my female loves toys. The boys are getting fat so I figured I'd give this a try since I could get it shipped free with another order and for the price, it was something I could justify even if they didn't like it.The first time I introduced it to them, my female latched on like it was her favorite toy. She totally loved it. The boys were a bit shy at first, batting at it like it was dangerous (like cats do when they feel threatened). It was hilarious to watch. Now, a week later, they fight over it, they drag it around the house, and I can sit at my computer and hold it while they bat at it and jump - all 3 of them play with it and totally have a blast with it. Who knew something so ridiculously simple could be such a big hit with a cat? Kudos to the makers of this toy, I will definitely be ordering more from here on. I don't think they will be happy without it now and I get such a kick out of watching them play and know they are enjoying their toy as much as I enjoy watching them with it. Don't hesitate - it's a great investment for a few bucks and not easily breakable either. Very pleased with this one! :-)",cats,2

"I recently got the Furminator and I do have to say, I am amazed at the amount of hair I can scrape off my Lab mix after a couple of minutes, plus it leaves his coat super shiny as an extra perk. My dog doesn't seem to enjoy it at all though. I'm assuming it probably feels odd, as it tugs on his not-yet-detached hairs.The handle grip is sturdy and way improved compared to the last version of this product, and the switch to up-down movement, versus left to right scraping, is much more natural.The lasting issue I have is how often to use it? Once or twice weekly doesn't seem to be enough to make a difference on my floor, so consider that this may need to become a part of your daily routine to get some true value out of it.",cats,2

"The positives of this litter box:Sleek design- many guests in my home do not even realize it right away as a litter box and many compliment me as to how neat it looks.Large- At one time I had 3 cats using the extra large size and they all were able to use it with ease.Cons:~The filter holder doesn't stay where it's needed, and it diminishes the necessity.~The selling point of this litter box was that it stops litter from being dispersed by the cats after being used by the steps. I can say that it might reduce the amount of litter while the cat exits the box, but it does not stop it. There are times when I saw my cat detour use of the stairs altogether and would leap in and out of it.~It can be hard to scoop with a straight scooping handle. Because of the curved base of the litter pan, there are times when it is difficult to get all of the old litter, unless you are using liners.~The lid does not latch to the bottom. This makes transporting the box a pain because you have to lift the whole box from the bottom instead of carrying it by the handle.I bought this while it was on sale, not paying more than 28 dollars, including shipping, so It wasn't an awful deal. I probably wouldn't buy it again however I believe it is better than most conventional litter boxes. Now I'm saving up for the flushable litter box because litter can be so expensive.",cats,2

"When I first came across the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box I thought it might be a litter box that would actually perform as advertised. It was a simple yet effective looking design so I ordered one to try out. I have had the litter box in use for almost week now and so far the box has worked flawlessly. My wife and I own two cats (10-12 lbs. each) and they instantly took to using the Omega Paw after I tossed the old Littermaid box that had long ago become a manually scooped receptacle.We both work long hours so the litter box is typically tended to twice a day. The box works exactly as directed, just roll the box over, tap the bottom to dislodge anything that might cling to the box itself, and roll back giving the box an extra shake/tilt the other way to redistribute the litter. The waste is neatly captured in the slide out tray and then dumped into a lined bucket with lid we have for containment. The first few times I would pop off the top and check on the performance. The litter has thus far been free of any missed clumps and as clean as or cleaner than it would be if we had repeatedly scooped and sifted with the hand tool. The older of our cats has a tendency to not squat down to urinate and the box has contained his poor aim allowing the clumping litter to do its job.The box is big enough for most cats including our older and larger male. He managed to partially miss outside the box once but I suspect that is because of his old age (minor arthritis/stiffness in back hip?) and a lack of familiarity with the box on day two. If anything, I believe this box will minimize his mishaps compared to our other boxes.I would recommend the box to anyone who needs a quick and effective means of cleaning a litter box with minimal waste contact. I don't worry as much about getting dirty when scooping before work because this box works very well. The covered box does a good job of containing litter and odor. The cats have also tracked out less litter since they have to step out of the box more than the old one. The one thing I plan to do is to spray the inside of the base with a non-stick litter box spray during out first thorough cleaning to help keep it cleaner, longer.Some reviews mention the clips that hold the box together and so far they feel fairly strong when sliding open/closed and I don't anticipate any problems with them. I plan to update my review in a couple weeks and will share any relevant information regarding their durability. So far, I have no hesitation giving this product a 5 star review and strong recommendation for cat owners looking to minimize time spent cleaning up after their cats.",cats,2

My cat was very sensitive to the astringent quality of the fluid, and it took a while for him to adjust to the sensation. Further complicating things is the design of the bottle. The plastic bottle is a little hard to squeeze, and the push-top cap (like a shampoo bottle) just makes it harder to be sure of the amount of fluid I'm squeezing out. I tried to follow the instructions on the bottle to simply saturate a cotton ball, hold it to the affected eye, and allow the product to seep out into the eye. That didn't work as my cat was too jumpy and the liquid went everywhere but into the eye. Then I tried squeezing a little fluid from the cotton ball into the eye--better, but the astringency was difficult for him to bear.Now I've switched to using a circular cotton pad (like a make-up pad) cut into fourths, and with a saturated pad, I dab gently at the eye and clear debris that way. Now that my cat is more accustomed to the fluid, he seems to welcome the cooling relief and now I can hold the pad to his eye, squeeze in a little fluid, or wipe his eyelid, and he responds well to all of these. He still gets encrusted and goopy eyes, but now I can clean them with ease.Ingredients (as listed on the bottle):De-ionized water, traditional hand filet aloe juice HF, FG, witch hazel, goldenseal fluid extract, gotu kola fluid extract, echinacea fluid extract.If you have a pet with weeping or encrusted eyes, try this product. It'll take a little while for everyone to get adjusted, but the benefits are well worth it.",cats,2
This brush is popular with all our critters. Looks like we will need another. No I am not going to use two hands. I am going to make my wife do some of the grooming. The cats love this brush and each takes turns in different locations. One keeps bringing it to me. Some like to bite it. I have one cat that I sprinkle water on before brushing. I swear that the cats are at least a pound lighter after being serviced. Some rub on the brush on their own. Now if I can just get them all to go and do it in the other room.Do not get the impression that just any brush will do. They know the difference and prefer this one. It is supposed to be electrostatic to attract the hair. Well it works even better it attracts the fur bearer.,cats,2
"By far, the best flexible dog crate we have ever owned (and we've had many). Airy, comfortable for dog and GREAT for travel. Highly recommend (unless you have a serious 'chewer').",dogs,3
My dog always likes to walk on our road and although we're the second to last house on it there are still a lot of cars that go to the house beside me... I feel better knowing that if she sneaks out of the yard at night there is something to help cars see her hopefully keeping her from ever getting hit!!! Thanks for a great product!,dogs,3
"Like many out there, I enjoy making my dog happy. I have a 9 year old German Shepard who still acts like a puppy. Only problem is that she tears every toy to shreds by chewing it endlessly. Now, I purchased the Large Kong and she absolutely loves it! Her favorite toy by far. She can chew it endlessly and will never destroy it! It has been about 2 months so far with it, and no damage. in addition, she lost weight and is now down to her healthy size! Less stress on her hips and joints :). Also, it is fun watching her chase this toy. If you throw it hard at the ground, it will wip and bounce across the yard, as if it is running from the dog. No doubt, all medium to large dogs will love this toy!",dogs,3
"Purchased 2 of the PS-40 and man do they do the job. I even bought the smaller version just to spice it up and be sure I had a good current flowing. The previous review stated that they made a horrible vibrating noise which I'm not sure if he had a faulty one or what. He did only have the one so it's entirely possible. I purchased 2 of the same and one of a smaller model from the same store and was perfectly happy with the performance. Only complaint was that the suction cups(only in the saltwater setups) tend to lose their suction if left uncleaned for a while. Even so, you can still get away with propping the power head in the corner( which is where you would have it anyways) and having the cord be as a support.I feel like all the suction cups I've encountered over the years from all different types of products from all different types of companies, have all fallen flat on the suction cup issue. What are you gonna do eh?",fish aquatic pets,4
"My dog loves, loves soft toys. I showed him how to use the toy, and would fill it for him (and he'd grab the squirrels out and rip at them) and then he figured out he could toss around and chew and tear the stump. Needless to say the stump is less capable of storing squirrels than it originally was.For what I paid for it, it's not a bad deal, but its also not as durable as I thought it would be. Perhaps the stump ought to be made of tougher material?",dogs,3

"This is a wonderful way to get your kitties to drink more water, especially if you don't want to be running to the faucet each time they meow at you. LOL. The fountains do require a certain amount of maintenance to keep them running.

"The concept is great - but it is a crappy product and a waste of money. It is completely unstable and while the stick on velcro is very strong (and it's still on the wall - it won't come off), the dynamics of the sill doesn't make it possible for a cat to lie or even sit down on it. My cats are of medium size and when one of the stepped on it - not jumped - the whole thing came crashing down. When my husband and I tried to secure it on, we failed miserably.If you love your cat, stay away from this one.",cats,2
"I normally give fish oil capsules from Nature's Made, but after seeing this product with high number of reviews I wanted to try it. The bottle came by itself (as opposed to include with other products) and well packaged. My dogs seem to love this oil. However, I noticed that both dogs start having runny bowel movement after I fed them the oil in their food. I am stopped using this for a while and start using capsule fish oil again to see if this fish oil is the culprit. All I want is to give my dogs the best fish oil for their health, and most economical purchase. I usually buy the Nature's Made FO when they have specials ""buy one get one free"". I was worried that maybe the Nature's Made brand may not be pure FO and I don't want to poison my dogs.",dogs,3

This litter box works as advertised. I get 3 to 4 weeks out of the system before I have to change to a new cartridge. That is with one cat of course. It works efficiently and very rarely misses any bowel movements left by my cat. This is the best one on the market and is available at a reasonable price.,cats,2
"Well my orange eye blue shrimps do eat them but it does leave behind quite a mess...but well they weren't originally intended as shrimp food anyways...and I think it helps making the water more clear.

"We use this as part of a preventative plan. We have 3 dogs and one cat that are all indoor/outdoor. We started using this product back in April 2011 as part of a flea prevention plan. Because 2 of our dogs are Pomeranian's and our cat is long haired sometimes I think some of the monthly treatment gets lost in their fur and they don't get the full treatment no matter how hard we try.The costSergeant's 24-Ounce Flea-Free Breeze Home and Carpet Sprayis more than regular fabric sprays like Febreeze, but it is much cheaper than battling fleas once infested. We use the spray about once a week during the hot months (which in San Antonio was 9 months out of the year). We spray the pets bedding, the area rug on our wood floors and our chenille sofas (which we bought before we had dogs and hope to change out with leather for Christmas).If we actually see a flea or our groomer finds them on the dogs then all the pet beds and sofa pillows and cushions get taken out to the porch and given a generous spraying ofSentryHOME Flea and Tick Home and Carpet Spray 96-Fluid Ounceand the carpets get a dusting of flea carpet sprinkle after the spray dries.Use some of the home and carpet spray to saturate a cotton ball and put inside your vacuum bag or keep a flea collar in the bag to kill any fleas that get sucked up. They can get out. It is best to take your vacuum outside and empty the bag (or cylinder as we have a Dyson) and seal it in a garbage back and take directly to the trash. Put the cotton ball or flea collar in the vacuum before taking it back in the house. Cotton balls should be changed every time you vacuum, flea collars can be reused for about 6 months and are also a good preventative measure.",cats,2
"This product came very highly recommended and after careful desensitizing we were able to use them on two of our dogs. They walk nicely individually but when together pulling was a problem. It did help lessen the pulling but the number of times this tool was confused with a muzzle just broke our hearts...people saw only the straps, not the friendly well-behaved dog inside it. When you own a breed endlessly maligned in the media and largely misunderstood you find yourself doing everything you can to avoid further mistaken negativity.Instead, we just started back at zero and re-taught proper walking with another dog just as we had when she was by herself.The dog we continued using the headcollar with did fine but not when we tried to transition to a martingale collar when he grew out of the Gentle Leader. Without the Head Collar, all bets were off and he acted as if he didn't know any leash manners at all! So we had to start at the beginning and retrain him to walk correctly with only his collar when with other dogs, too.The Premier Head Collar is a highly effective tool, it just wasn't quite right for our situations. To avoid the same negativity issues with our new youngsters but obtain the same principles of control (turning the dog when it pulls and having excellent control in excitable situations as they learn good leash manners) we used the Premier Easy Walk harness--clipped to their martingale collars for extra safety, since athletic and determined dogs can wriggle out of the harness. They have transitioned from use of the harness to just their collars as they get older with none of the problems we had trying to transition from Head Collar to martingale only. This was probably entirely our fault but others might have had the same issues, too.",dogs,3

"I like the ComfortZone product very much, I think it works better than Adaptil DAP...one small problem though, I was shipped the Adaptil in error, but since I needed it, I kept it.

"Although I had compared the dimension measurements included in the product description with the size of our old carrier, I was disappointed to note that this one was smaller than anticipated. The old one could tranport two cats to the vet; the new one will comfortably take only one cat.Other reviewers indicated that the carrier was hard to assemble. My husband did not have any difficulty putting it together and had it done in about 15 minutes.",cats,2
"I have one of these that is a few years old, and after going through 3 dogs, it needed replacement. The new one I just ordered was destroyed after just a couple of play sessions and the filling was about 3/4 as much as the previous toy. If you have a puppy or dog with strong chewing, you probably shouldn't consider this toy (I have an 8 month old goldendoodle).",dogs,3
"Overall, this item is great! We bought it for our teacup yorkie who is about 2.75 lbs. We can fit a full size pee pad w/ tray on the bottom level, her food on the other side and she sleeps on the second level of the crate. We've had all types of set ups for her and she has done the best in this! It is so easy to clean too! She likes to throw her food all around when she eats, but it just falls through the bottom of the crate and I can pull the tray right out to clean it. And it is so convenient that it rolls around so easily! Unlike anything else I've come across as far as crates go. Definitely worth the money!The only reason I gave this item a 4 stars is bc the latch is difficult to push through and lock, but the door gate also has a lift lock as well to keep the door gate secure and that works just fine! We are very happy with our purchase!",bunny rabbit central,1
"This mat is great to keep the pet food mess down to a minimum, while being easy to clean. Functionally it is perfect.

"My 14-year old dog has arthritis in his hips, and despite rubber-backed rugs nearly everywhere, he has been slipping on my floors while I'm not home or asleep. Laying on the hardwood floor for hours until I find him wasn't working well :( I wanted to find something safe but softer, lightweight and more roomy than a metal crate. This playpen is perfect! It's small enough for him to feel cozy and secure, sleeping with his back against the ""wall."" He's 70 lbs. and the 36"" x 36"" square is about 1.5 times the size of his orthopedic bed, but not so much extra room that he flails around.The steel frame is fairly heavy and substantial, so when he misses the base area while lying down (he was always missing the bed surface because of stiffness) he just falls against the soft walls on the way down ;) The removable cover allows me to bend into the pen to help lift him up, or clean him up if he can't get up to potty, which -- if you have an ill or senior dog -- you know is amazingly helpful. So is the waterproof liner on the bottom, held in place with velcro. I thought it came with a pad, too, but I'm just going to cut pieces of foam to fit, and drape with washable covers.I found it a little difficult to open on my own, sort of like trying to hold both ends of the wrapping paper tight as you reach for the tape :) but I just ditched the instructions and held the bottom bars down with my foot as I pulled up and locked the top rails. This pen is expensive but extremely well made -- while it might not work if your dog is a chewer or unused to being crated, it's an excellent way to safely and comfortably contain an aging pet.",dogs,3

"I've been heavily involved in the aquarium hobby for about 40 years now. I was a little hesitant about ordering this filter after reading some of the negative comments here on Amazon. I was especially worried about the filter leaking. I called Marineland customer service and spoke to a rep about my worries regarding the leaking issue. He assured me that the leaking problems with this product line have long since been corrected. So I took a chance and ordered one. I'm very glad that I did. The filter is solid. Very well engineered. It's easy to set up and maintenance is very easy. Three large media containers give you a lot of versatility. I'm running this filter on a 50 gallon tank using Polyfilter, Chemipure, filter floss and Purigen in the media containers. I also run a Emperor 400 on the back of the tank. My tank was previously running using only the Emperor 400 and was never quite as clean as I wanted it to be. Since adding the C-160 my water is crystal clear. This filter is also completely silent. You can't hear a thing unless you put your ear right up against the canister. I recommend this filter to everyone.",fish aquatic pets,4
My puppy carries this all around the house. She loves to chew on it and pulls on the little knotted strings. Sturdy too so I don't worry that she can pull it apart and swallow pieces of fabric. Nice teething toy for my Chi pup.,dogs,3
"I don't believe I have ever written one of these reviews before, but since I am so pleased with this purchase I thought I would add my comments. My kitten LOVES this toy!! She is full of energy and we have bought her quite a few toys. A few of them she likes but after a little while of playing with them she becomes bored. We continually had to switch toys to get her worn out so that she wouldn't wake up at 3 or 5 in the morning and begin whining for someone to play with.After reading the reviews here I thought I'd give it a shot. Not only was the price right but she never tires of this toy. The fabric is made in a way that she can never catch and hold onto it. If she does ""catch"" it I just give it a little flick with my hand and it comes flying out from under her. I get tired way before she does, and when we stop playing with her she cries to have someone play with her again and carries the toy over to us.Here are a few descriptions so that you get a sense of what it looks like. The wand is a clear plastic that seems very sturdy. Her previous opaque wand toys she would eventually begin to chew on the wand part only when she figured out that was where all the motion was coming from. The ribbon is a brightly colored fleece-like material that is around 3-4ft in length, I believe, so that you can twirl it in all different directions (think gymnastic ribbon routines). It's also quiet too which is a nice alternative to some of the jingly louder toys.There are, I'm sure, some other great toys out there that I haven't found yet. However, I just feel that for the price and the enjoyment for both you and the cat you can't really go wrong here.",cats,2

"I occasionally bought compressed rawhide bones for Snikkers because he loves them to the point of obsession. But they get a bit costly in packs of 2 or 4 from chain-pet-stores-that-shall-remain-nameless.I was happy to find them available here in bulk, although I was a little skeptical about the quality. See, if a compressed rawhide chew isn't *really* all that compressed, our doggie gnaws through it rather quickly (and makes a lot of disgusting noises doing it). I was hoping these would be tough enough to keep him happily occupied for hours -- and they are!They arrived loose in a plain cardboard box. (Snikkers now gets excited whenever the UPS guy delivers ANYTHING in a cardboard box.) The fun part is letting him pick one out for himself. But maybe we're just easy to entertain around here. ;)",dogs,3

"I never dreamed this thing would work like it does. You keep brushing and brushing and the hair keeps falling and falling. This is one great doggie brush!My doggies agree! They like being brushed with this brush - so much they try and move each other out of the way to get brushed! This has never happened before at grooming time!My only advice would be to get out in the yard or an open area. The brush doesn't hold the hair and the hair doesn't clump up so that you can neatly dispose of it. If you want to clean it up, you'll need to brush it up.",cats,2
"This is a great powerhead! My tank is a tall 110 gallon aquarium, and the maxi-jet 1200 in combination with my Marineland 350 power filter circulates all of the water in the tank nicely. I've placed the powerhead mid-level in my tall tank, and even the water at the very top and very bottom moves in a clockwise current. It's fun to watch my angelfishes try to fight the top-level current or my sharks/clown loaches play in the currents at the bottom of the tank. It comes with many attachments, which is great for hobbyists like me who like to change their minds (in terms of what you want to use the powerhead for) or who just like to try new things with it. The maxi-jet 1200 is probably going to be too strong for tanks smaller than 50 gallons (and even then, it may still push your fish around), so you may want to use a smaller size or utilize the attachments that come with the 1200 to control the strength of the current. Plus, the price of this product in stores is over $50, which is outrageous, but I got it off amazon for about $25!! Fantastic savings in a recession :) Overall, great product!",fish aquatic pets,4
"I had this box for a couple of years and it was getting kinda yucky. So I decided to replace it with the newer model (not sure of the number, but it was the more rounded one with metal rake). I hated that one and after about 3 months went serching for this one again. The 700 is just the right size. I like how it rolls up at the end of the cycle before tipping back down to dump the ""load"". The plastic rake works just fine. It is used by one cat, but the bin still fills up pretty fast (about a week). I have read others mention dumping and reusing the bins (I guess this would be fine, but I don't), so there is a continuing cost for the bins. Over all my cat (Emma) and I love it.By the way, it is not totally maintenance free, you can't just ignore it for a week! I use the scoop daily to stir the litter and remove any little particals that may be left behind and to make sure the bottom is scrapped clean, but this process takes about a minute/day. My cat uses the same spot in the box everytime, so sometimes the bin gets filled up on one side, again, just use the scoop and even it out.I highly recommend the LitterMaid 700.",cats,2
"After 2 non shedding dogs, I adopted a dog who sheds. I was going crazy with all the dog hair. My friend recommended the furminator. It is a very worthwhile purchase. Of course my dog still sheds but the furminator has been an enormous help. The amount of shedding has at least been cut in half and I can pet her without getting a handful of hair all over my clothes! I brush her for a few minutes about 2 times a week. I am sure if I was more vigilant in brushing, the loose hair would be eliminated completely. I definitely would buy this brush again.",cats,2

I will cont to use this product until I finish it I use it at night before I turn the lights off only because it really clouds up the water and hate to see that during the day by the time the lights come on in the morn its crystal clear again.

Probably from heat or some other normal thing during production. The string seems to be stuck to the bag.This is such a small thing as to not make it a problem really. All other aspects of the bags overcome this small little thing.If it wasn't for this I would have given them 5 stars.",cats,2

"I have had the Nutrafin system for a few months now. I used the included Activator/Stabilizer packets for the first 3 months,then switched to molasses based sugar and yeast.Some observations:The ladder style CO2 diffuser really works well. Evidence ofthis is the size of the CO2 bubble that is introduced intothe diffuser at the bottom compared to the size of the bubblethat comes out at the top. The bubble becomes an order ofmagnitude smaller as it traverses the diffuser- which is anotherway of saying that CO2 is getting dissolved in the water. Whenit is first introduced to a new aquarium, this observation alone could verify that it is working.For anyone expecting quick results, it took about 15 days beforemy plants showed ""pearling"" and about another week (around 21-22days) before I saw the promised lush green plant growth. (Notethat I have 2.5 watts per gallon of light for 10 hours a day anduse Seachem Flourish once a week.)There is no easy way to turn off CO2 diffusion with the system.Once the lights turn off and unless the water is sufficiently buffered, pH can be dramatically and dangerously reduced. Startwith buffered, neutral water and after 3 weeks it may have turnedslightly acidic- which is an ideal environment for many aquaticplants.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I have two large dogs (both over 90 lbs) and they drink quite a bit of water. I bought this so I wouldn't worry about them getting thirsty when I am gone all day at work. It works exactly like it says.It took my one dog a few weeks to get used to it though. He is a bit skittish and when the dish gets low on water, an air bubble gurgles up in the bottle and makes a noise and it scares him. It was actually pretty funny for the first few days.One negative I have is the weight. A small person may have trouble filling and flipping the jug over as 5 gallons of water weighs quite a bit.Overall I would recommend this to anyone with large dogs that go through lots of water.",cats,2

"Bed time at my house was getting a little cramped. With my 2 dogs on the bed, my boyfriend and i felt like there was no room for us to sleep. I've gotten my larger dog a dog bed before, but it was nothing too special and she rarely used it. I knew i had to get her something big and comfy or else she would just keep sleeping on our bed. Most were so expensive, so i was so glad to find this and read the good reviews on it. It arrived and was even bigger and fluffier than i expected. I pulled it out of the package and both dogs immediately came over to test it out. While she doesn't sleep on it every night yet, it's still an improvement. My little dog peed on it the other day though, so i will see how it holds up after a washing.",dogs,3
"I've only tried this on my dog once so far, but it seems to be working really well. My dog tends to bark a lot at other dogs when she is on leash. I took her out for a long walk with the collar on. The first time she barked once, it sprayed her and she clearly was taken by surprise. She got sprayed probably eight or ten times along our walk, each time she barked at another dog. But she was starting to get it - she was barking only once or twice at a dog, not constant barking like previously. The last dog we passed - no bark at all. Next time I use it, I am going to bring treats so I can reward her for not barking. I have been trying to train her to stop this behavior for 3 years with not much success, and this product seems to make a huge difference. The feedback she gets with the spray is immediate and consistent so I think that will help.The product itself seems well made and easy to use. It's very easy to fill from the can of citronella they send you. It works like it's supposed to - spraying when they bark. I never saw it spray her other than when she barked. The spray definitely got her attention. It's not too big or heavy on her neck and she doesn't seem to mind wearing it (she's a medium sized dog).So while we will have to wait and see as to the long term efficacy of this product, so far I am pleased. It works as advertised and seems to be having a positive effect.Update",dogs,3
"I was tired of the same old litter boxes, but didn't want to spend 100's of dollars on one of those ""automatic"" ones. So I thought this would be a great middle choice.The box does work as promised in most cases. But you really have to make sure to change it out pretty quickly. If you let the mess sit too long the clumps become too big to fit in the slide-out tray and you're left doing it the old-fashoined way.If you're able to keep a good schedule and empty this punctually, it's a great product. But rest assured, even if you do it in a timely manner, you will have to occasionally open the box and scoop manually. Mess is bound to get stuck to the bottom and sides...or become to big to dump into the tray.So it's not perfect, but it makes the routine cleaning a lot easier than the run-of-the-mill letter box.",cats,2
it's not as big as I had hoped but it's nice. it's best feature other than being white is that it's made from resin. Coral belongs in the ocean.. lets keep it there. Yay for resin.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I LOVE this litter box. I went searching for a new litter box, because my new puppies had decided that Kitty Krunchies were delicious. I couldn't seem to stop them from heading straight for that litter box when they smelled a deposit. NASTY!I've put this litter box on a shelf in my laundry room, that is about 2 feet high. I then used one of my husband's c-clamps to secure the litter box so the cat wouldn't knock it over as he was jumping out. The c-clamp is basically tightened on the wood of the shelf, right up against the litter box, so the litter box has no wiggle room. I probably could have left the litter box on the floor, and the puppies probably would have left it alone, but I felt better having it up a bit.Anyway, this litter box has successfully stopped my puppies from the Kitty Krunchies! It's also EXTREMELY reduced the cat litter that is around the box. I wish I would have gotten this box when my cat was a kitten, not 14! My cat is one of those that LEAPS, nay FLIES out of the box when he's done, spewing litter to all four corners of the earth. This box has slowed down his exit, and the grooves in the lid really catch litter. My cat took to the box very quickly, I didn't gradually remove the old for the new, I simply got rid of the old for the new! YES, I'm impatient. I put my cat on top of the box, and he was immediately curious. He stuck he head into the hole 4-5 times, leaned in a few times, then finally decided to take the plunge, and peed right then and there! Ever since it's been used without issue. I think he likes the privacy aspect of the box. Also, he's a fat old cat, and can still jump in and out, so that shouldn't be an problem for most.I use the Glad Strong Large 30 gallon black trash bags for this. Cheaper than what they sell, and fits great.Don't delay, order today!",cats,2

"I bought this product for my paraplegic kitty with incontinence. It did not fit. The only measurement around the waist does not provide enough information for you to understand whether this garment is right for your pet or not. The cutout for the tail is HUGE (4"" in diameter) and everything (pooing and peeing parts of the body) is exposed through it making this garment completely ridiculous and useless. So, if someone wants to use it for the dog in heat - it's, quite likely, not going to work. The front part of the garment is too long and even if it is gathered with the elastic band - it does not fit snugly around the pet's legs exposing everything yet again and it looks very baggy, not wide enough and uncomfortable. The welt fabric of this garment is not soft enough and may cause irritation and even sores on a very tender inner legs' and tummy's skin. The Velcro used there is so stiff, that it makes very loud popping/crinkling sounds when bent and it looks like it is an industrial strength Velcro. The elastic gathering of the front of the garment is not elastic enough to provide snuggle yet comfortable fit around the pet's waste and I think that it might cause digestion problems like acid reflux.",dogs,3
"I gave this stocking 4 stars, wanted to give 5 but there was no glitter pen included to write my pet's name. I'll have to go out and buy one now.

My friend has a little Rottwieler puppy that had bad kidneys. The vet said she would die soon. We went into action and discoverd that Dr. Harvey's food is actually easy on her kidneys. She has gained 12 pounds in less than 2 months which is a miracle. She is playing again and getting very sassy! I will keep my girl eating what she loves; Dr. Harvey's. I tried a bite myself and with a little salt and pepper, I could eat it too!",cats,2

"I've had this cat litter box for well over a year now, close to two years, I believe. It's not perfect, but it's way ahead of whatever is in second place. I've had no problem with warping or anything like that, but the caveat is that if your cats are like mine, they will not leave it alone. The fake mulch will disappear, eventually. They'll claw it out, you'll find it in a corner of a room and put it back, until eventually it disappears altogether. I never could find a solution to this problem. A pity, but I can live with that -- it doesn't need the mulch. They will not leave the leaves alone either. A few leaves are somewhat rattier looking than when I first bought it -- but still, it looks good enough, a hundred times better than a regular cat box, and in my two-room apartment, that factor alone is very much worth the price. The new picture on Amazon now looks as if the leaves are different than the one I originally bought -- somewhat higher off the ground, which may help the problem. This item is a very nice solution if you can't hide a cat box, and if mine ever wears out, I will certainly be looking to see if Amazon still carries it.",cats,2
I have a small 3 gallon tank with a beta fish in it. This pump works great for the tank that i have.

"I'd been using Dr. Elsey's for some time, but decided to give this one a chance when I was shopping at a store that didn't sell Dr. Elsey's. This litter is worse in almost every way. It's dustier than Dr. Elsey's, it doesn't control odor as well (in fact, the litter itself has an unpleasant smell), and it does not clump as well. My cat tries to bury his waste repeatedly because he doesn't like it either. It may be biodegradable and septic safe, but with the downsides I mentioned and the cost, I'm going back to Dr. Elsey's.I still gave it two stars because it clumps a little bit and is better than an average grocery store litter.",cats,2

For starters the price was fantastic especially compared to the same product in Oz which was $275 and the effectiveness was immediate however I only used the collar very occasionally and accordingly to a psychologist friend this is the best way to use such a method - use it too much and the dog ignores the correction - intermittant is better. The best way to apply a correction is in the moment and that is not always possible. I have spent a lot of money on trainers before I discovered this collar but I do stress the occasional use - more than a few minutes and you create another adverse reaction.,dogs,3
"The reason this is killing peoples' fish is the horrible blend of chemicals in it to make it into such a tablet form, the fact that your fish are not going to eat from it since it releases powder (you wouldn't eat powder after nice meat pellets or tasty flakes, would you?), and lastly, most importantly, the fact that this thing is releasing nothing but pure ammonia (super toxic!) into your tank that you won't be around to clean out while you're on vacation (especially in those 1g bowls - forget it). Your fish will get poisoned and die, or at least be incredibly sick and weak when you return.Truth be told, feed them a few extra pellets/flakes before you go, and your fish will be fine without food for a week. Overall, it'll be much healthier for them since no one will be around to clean out their tanks and do water changes. If it'll be two weeks or more, maybe get a friend to come over every couple of days to drop some pellets in and teach them how to change the water (be sure to emphasize not overfeeding... I had a friend go nuts with the food and my fish almost died from overfeeding and ammonia poisoning when I got back - uneaten pellets were everywhere).In short, save a fish, don't buy this or anything like it! :)",fish aquatic pets,4

I also live in a small studio, and the Drinkwell was quite loud and had to be filled up constantly. That Catit is almost silent.. amazing...Oh yea, out of the box It wasn't distributing the water evenly, so I followed the instructions from their website and cleaned it with 50% Vinegar and %50 Water.. I pluged it in, let it run and after a few minutes it worked flawlessly.It also looks cooler, and doesnt spill as much as the other bowls..Oh yea my cat loves it too... took him about 20 minutes to figure it out!",dogs,3

"While many people use flexi or other retractable leads, I rather use a long line like this... nowhere near as dangerous, and it's loads easier to hold on to (no chunky handle... my hand is too small to hold onto the huge flexi lead handle, and even with this lead all bundled up, it's smaller than that)... not to mention if you drop it, the dog won't run all the way to the north pole in fear. Plus, it makes no annoying clicks or whirls (and you have no worry of having to amputate either your leg or your dog's leg if it gets tangled up in either).I like using this as a drag line out in the park so my dog can have freedom and I can have an easy way of collecting her if she doesn't respond to a recall. It's very soft in my hands, and I have knots all through it at certain lengths so I can step on it and stop my dog, without having the leash slide under my shoe.Also, for long walks in the country, I put a harness on my dog and hook this up to her... she's able to go ahead of me a bit or stop and sniff the flowers while I keep going. Unlike a flexi lead, she doesn't need to be constantly pulling me, so that's not an issue.One thing I really like about this long line is that it is easy to untangle, but once you put a knot in it then that knot's going to be there forever. Something that I'm a little disappointed about in this leash is that if you let it drag on the road AT ALL, there's a little bit of wear on it, especially where knots are... so I'd suggest not letting it drop to the ground if you're walking on the road. In the grass is fine, but not on the road.",dogs,3

Most importantly the filter that is built into the top canopy of the aquarium is very good. It is one of those filters with the biowheel and a small waterfall. The falling stream of water creates oxygenation, and the biowheel will serve as a home for good bacteria. The filter is very quiet as well.I do not know what type of light this kit comes with incandescent(bulb) or flourescent(tube) but mine came with a small fluorescent tube.

Then it just stopped working, and the dog continued to bark away. I filled it with more citronella, tested it by blowing on the microphone, and it clicks like it's going to release citronella but it never does. Amazon won't take it back because it has pressurized gas, and I don't see any contact information for the manufacturer to see if they'll replace it. Also, the plastic buckle is really flimsy and let's the collar loosen. Bummer that companies can get away with not standing behind their products.",dogs,3

"I would encourage everyone interested in this product to research it and see the amazing scientific properties that have been proven about DMG. Commonly used in horses DMG is now making it's way into the dog and cat sector and this is wonderful. To keep this review short I will say we had a feline leukemia cat that had crashed. Liver shakes and DMG were the last chance medical advice given by a holistic vet as all other vets wanted to put him down as he had a crit level (red cell count) of like 8, 7 being really the lowest you can go.. My daughter was not ready to lose her cat and he was not in pain so we tried the holistic way and were amazed. The cat rebounded and gained back his strength and was his old self again which was amazing. Unfortunately he did develop lymphoma 4mths later but when they checked his red cell count it was NORMAL! They were amazed and wanted to know what had done to conquer the low count and we told them about the DMG and how it helps cats with this disease. They use this treatment now on all positive cats and I always have a bottle on hand in my home for my pets should they become ill or have any infections etc. This stuff is simply incredible.",cats,2

Unfortunately, even though I tried multiple litters that were suggested to me that work ""better"" for this litter box, the box still had trouble gathering the clumps of poop and when the spokes did catch any poop, the fact that it has to open up and scoop it over a little ramp is the fault in this product. The spokes are not long enough to keep the poop from just falling right back into the litter box, and they are not long enough to get the bottom of the litter box at all, where clumps of urine form. The ramp that is supposed to be clothed to keep the cat's paws clean does not work, and even fell off after a week. After that, the tracking of litter around my house was horrendous, even more so than a regular litter box, despite having high sides and ramp.

"This is a rather expensive nail trimmer that does not do a good job of cutting my dog's nails. First, I think the blade is geared for a smaller dog (even though the one I own is supposed to be for a ""mid-sized"" dog), it takes a lot of hand strength to cut the actual nail. Then, it shatters the nail rather than cuts it, so you end up with splinters, rather than a clean nail slice.On top of that, this trimmer is supposed to find the quick, well the only time is gives you the green light is when the trimmer is away from the dog's nail.

When we returned from vacation, it had done its job - all meals dispensed, and kitty greeted us with no desperation or disdain. Concerning other notes, yes, it takes a bit of force to really lock it down, but once it is secured, it holds strong.",cats,2
"I had two cats in the past, both liked this toy, but one of them just LOVED it and never got tired of it. I got her to do high jumps and almost full flips playing with her with this thing. After many years, we now have a new cat that is very spazzy, and the way she plays, sits, and lays (with hind legs sprawled out) reminds me a lot of my cat who had loved this toy, so I got this yet again. Sure enough our new cat is going crazy over it. When not playing with her, she grabs hold of the end of it and drags it around the house. It's just a wire with some cardboard at the ends, but it's a very affordable price and great for spazzy cats that love playing. That last one I owned, I had for years. My cat never got tired of it.",cats,2
"I have a thirty gallon tank with eight medium size fish. I was paying $13.99 for a 5.65 oz container from the local fish store. I did the math and I figure buying the monster size will save me $130 a year. It was advertised as 10 pounds if I remember correctly, but the delivered size was 4.52 pounds. I have been told by a neighbor that if I don't use it up quick enough, worms may grow in the bucket. I have had the bucket about three months so far and no sign of worms. Either way, I have already saved money over buying from the local store.",fish aquatic pets,4

"My small Amazon can destroy this in an hour if she feels like it, or it can last for weeks, depending on her mood. We used to let her chew up seed sticks. I switched from seed sticks to this toy because the mess is so much less messy than seeds and it's just as much fun. Shredded yucca fibers beat chunks of sticky coated seeds any day. She never gets tired of this toy, she always runs over to get it whenever I put a fresh one in her cage. This is something we always have to have available for her. It keeps her happy and satisfies her chewing/shredding/nesting urges.",birds,0

I like this toy because when my daughter`s chihuahua and Cairn terrier come over there are enough tentacles so that all four dogs (my two tea cup Yorkies) can all grab one and play!

"After reading the reviews and looking at the price (for $10 you can't go wrong), I decided to try this item to see if I could train my dogs to stop barking on command. I tried this device on my 2 dachshunds and at first they stopped barking when I pushed the button. Those dogs being what they are, though, soon learned to ignore it. Oh, well.Next I tried it on neighborhood dogs we encounter on our walks. They are OK dogs, but can be a nuisance sniffing around and getting in the way. I've tried it on at least 5 dogs--one being an overgrown lab/horse mix (I think). I aim the device, push the button and they immediately stop in their tracks and either walk or run the other way. It seems to work at least up to 15 feet from the dog.Lately, the device stopped working. The light came on, but all dogs ignored me. I think I broke it when I dropped it on the pavement. So, for $10, I'll get another one.I wish I had a way of knowing if there was a sound coming out. Must be some way of testing....",dogs,3
"I am a groomer, I have both sizes small and large bamboo clipper and the small is just fine for all small dogs, I use them on 4 lb. yorkies and Chihuahuas every day so it will do fine on a Shih Tzu, I will even use the large clipper on a small dog if it is quickly accessable, it all boils down to if you are comfortable and know what you are doing. I would reccomend going to a groomer and having it done. Vets will do it but charge double to what groomers charge for just a nail trim.",dogs,3

"Had to take it down as soon as the cat climbed onto it--he didn't even jump on it, just walked onto it from the sill. As soon as he sat down, I could hear the velcro making that ripping sound--cat wasn't even wiggling around. I'd let the tape ""cure"" for 48 hours and all that. I don't want to put holes in the oak windowframes either (plus, I think I'd have to buy washers so the screws don't rip through the plastic, and would have to install some sort of padding on the legs since they seemed to slip around on the wall too much). Yea, about the legs, they don't really support anything. The cat is a large 15 pound siamese, calm as can be, and I decided to remove him before the shelf fell down with him on it. Upon removing the shelf, the paint came up on the vecro strips (couldn't unhook the velcro from itself). I do not recommend this product.",cats,2

"We adopted a feral cat and bought this thermal mat because it can get cold in the garage (which is where she lives). It makes a tiny bit of crinkling noise when stepped on, but she wasn't bothered by the sound at all (even though she is feral and still a bit skittish). The mat is made of plush, cozy fabric and is machine washable. Our cat loves the mat and hardly leaves it on days that are a bit chilly. It seems to really work because she also has a pet bed and a bed made out of blankets in the garage and she seems to prefer her mat. Definitely worth the price.",cats,2

I ordered this because it was I need one ASAP and didnt think it was necessary to pay $20 for one of these silly things. I got it to work on my 1/8 inch thick glass lid but its not made for that thickness. It has two rows of &#34;ribs&#34; running through it which make it impossible to squeeze it on 1/8 inch glass. I didnt have time to return it so I sliced the ribs out with a razor blade and got it to fit snuggly on the glass that way. Its for a smaller thickness of glass.,fish aquatic pets,4

"Like most dogs,my dog does not like having his teeth brushed. It almost seems like a futile attempt to clean his teeth, as he would only stay still to brush about a quarter of his teeth. He would then squirm & run away. This is a wonderful invention, as he actually begs for the brush. Even though he still does not get every tooth, it's better than before & the best part is that he's happily brushing by himself. That makes me happy as well.",dogs,3
"This product did not work. It did not kill the fleas fast enough to prevent the life cycle. I applied the Frontline Plus to my cats as soon as I noticed one flea in my house. 3 weeks later, I was dealing with a full blown infestation. When I contacted my vet, she said Frontline is a waste of money. It takes up to 24 hours to kill the flea which does not prevent them from laying eggs. And the longer the product is on the cats, the less effective it is. So by week 2 it may take up to 48 hours for the flea to die. My vet highly recommended Advantage, which kills the fleas within 5 minutes of biting the cat. I applied the Advantage and 2 days later, not one flea in site. AMAZING. Do not waste your money on Frontline... buy Advantage, your cats will thank you.",cats,2

"I have a 13 1/2 lb. ShihTzu/Yorkie mix. She is a chewer, so I got the Medium ""15-35 lb."" rated ""Medium"" Stick. I added a treat & luckily I supervised the puppy the first time I gave her the KONG Dental Stick. Within 5-10 min. at the most, she had several chunks of rubber off the end of the stick. In the past, the only toys I gave her when totally unsupervised were KONG toys. This product is definitely not nearly as durable as their other items. Unless your dog is a very gentle chewer, this is NOT a safe item. I have never had a problem with a KONG product before, but I DO NOT recommend this item.",dogs,3

"OK, so I saw this after searching for something to quiet the neighbor dog's incessant barking at all hours of the night and it seemed like a great idea. However, it seems to suffer from mixed reviews and I suspect that it's because it is such a small and under-powered device. Imagine trying to annoy your neighbors by cranking up a small handheld radio. It just doesn't quite cut it. The thing is probably like a gnat in the dog's ear, so it may get the idea or it may not.So I considered other possibilities and discovered what I feel is a better idea",dogs,3

"I put new carpet in the bedroom and my cat decided it was a good place to go. I was getting frustrated because I don't normally have an issue with the cat. I was getting to the point where I was thinking of getting rid of her which I really hate to do.She's a healthy and young cat so I don't want to put her to sleep either. So I bought this product in hopes it will work. I sprayed the carpet every where she had gone before, and everywhere she may think to go. It worked. She doesn't go on the carpet at all now. She is back to going in her robotic kitty litter box. The only down fall to this product is the odor from the can made me gag. It does smell pretty bad, but the smell of cat urine is much worse so gagging wasn't so bad. The smell thank god didn't linger. I would recommend this product, however you may want to crack a window before spraying.",cats,2
"It works OK on the dog in the next yard but not those farther than the 25 feet as indicated in the details. That's to be expected. At first, the dog would bark and then whimper and stop. But it continues to bark later. I would say it has cut down the closest dog's incessant barking, but not entirely. I'd rather have one that shocks the owner's since they're the ones who do nothing about the dog's barking. Product is OK.",dogs,3
"We needed something to keep our dog from jumping on to the kitchen counters (especially when my wife or I weren't looking). This has worked great ever since December 2011.Our dog has quickly learned that the warning beeps means that he should move out of the area. He gets a little worried when other things start beeping, but he gets over it quickly.We don't put it on every day, but I have noticed a couple times when the collar didn't seem to work. It seems to only happen if the collar is turned on too far away from the base station.My only real complaint is that since the barrier field is spherical, so it just doesn't keep him off the counter, it keeps him out of most of the kitchen. If we decrease the range to it's minimum, it doesn't restrict all the counter space. Depending on your desired use, this may or may not work.Overall, this product works great. The warning beeps before the shock are great so you know your best friend isn't always getting shocked. The shock itself is not really painful (yes, I've tested it on myself).",dogs,3

"I have 2-4 yorkies living with me at anytime. They are really picky with food and treats(aka spoiled brats). They really hate hard food and treats and its been frustrating getting them to eat dog bisquets or the like to help with the dental aspect of care. They tend to love the soft crap that is made to look appealing to us humans like little steaks, bacon, etc. As you know those are crap. They are unhealthy for your pet and they are made with god only knows what. They actually like these treats. They are hard enough for little dogs to help with the oral care and since they are not made in china I personally trust them more.

"Ok, so I have this Cat Genie for about a week now and honestly I have to say this is a great invention and works great when it's operating properly. Upon receiving it, I hooked it up immediately and ran a wash cycle to see how it worked. To my surprise, I heard the dreaded beeps and notice the water was filled to the rim of the cat genie. The water stopped but it did not drain out, bear in mind this was 6pm pacific time and customer service was unavailable. At this time, I realized that I was really lucky that I did not wait for a present from my cat before starting the wash cycle, because I would be totally pissed off if I had to touch poop soup the first time I ran this thing, plus paying over $300.00 for something that did'nt work when you got it does not sit well with me. So I grab the instruction manual and try to diagnois the problem myself, the manual tells you to push a few button and guess what? The water started over flowing the cat genie on to my bathroom floor making the area into a toxic swamp of water and plastic litter. To my cat's amusement, he just mowed at me as I cursed up a storm while trying to figure out how to drain the water out. There was no easy solution for this as I figured out, if I dump all of the water out, the plastic litter would be dump as well, so in order to save the litter, what I figured out is that you have to lift the cat genie above the drain hose and let gravity drain the water out, this is a slow process but the only way without losing any plastic litter. So after all this, as you can tell, I was not a happy camper. I called customer service the very next day and they walked me through and told me that the problem is the hopper and propeller where it could be dislodged during shipping. customer service is very helpful and sent out a replacment hopper in 3 days. With the new hopper, the cat genie is working now but not without some complications and headaches. I do have to say, I love coming home to a fresh smelling home and if I want clean my litter box, I just push a buttom, very cool and easy.",cats,2
"This product does work for us. Our veterinarian recommended a recycling water fountain for our old cat who doesn't drink enough water. Now, our cats love it (all four of them). It is a pain to clean and the pump gets clogged up *very* easily. The carbon filter is useless as far as maintaining water quality, but I still use it as it catches some of the cat fluff before it clogs up the pump. This drinking fountain doesn't really hold a lot of water so I top it off every day or two, and then take it apart for cleaning once a week. Like I said, cleaning it is kind of awkward and a pain.If I had to buy another water fountain again, I'd probably research some other brands before purchasing, but for the price, this one does ok.",dogs,3

"This feeder really helped me to put my cat on a diet. While the programming is not necessarily intuitive, it's not something you need a PhD to do, either. This is a great product I recommended to many of my friends, but my cat has managed to break the spring-loading mechanism over the last couple months. She figured out how to rotate the cover back to the first compartment, and then even further, so she would start eating the food that was set aside for her last feeding. I compensated by refilling the feeder more regularly and not putting any food in the last compartment, but she had already made a habit of playing with the feeder and has since gotten it stuck several times over the wrong compartment.I have also had the problem of the battery coming loose, which I solved by taping the battery in with electrical tape and by taping the feeder to the floor to prevent my cat from sliding it all over the kitchen in her attempts to be fed.I think this is a good product for:1) cats that are docile and less determined to eat than mine is2) occasional use. If you are looking for something you will only use on weekends away, this would be easy to store and is pretty cheap. It also has availabe ice packs so you can use wet food.I'm going to buy one of the heavier timed stand-up dispensers (that is, in fact, what I am doing on Amazon right now) and hope it lasts a little longer. Overall, though, I think my cat and I got my money's worth from this product and I'm sad to see it go.",cats,2

"I got this product, very skeptical because I have a 15 lb cat, and a smaller 10 lb cat. As I read all the good reviews of other customers saying how it held their 15-20 lb cats , I figured I'd give it a try. My cats loved it for the first 5 or so days, then , just as I thought, it started falling! I do believe however, it MAY have to do with my window sills being so small, even though the product description says it would fit on any sill. I am going to try to use the screws it came with, hopefully my cats will not be too fearful to try to get on it again.

"When we first adopted Dakota, we'd never owned a dog crate or kennel. Our other dog had free run of the house. Dakota was a pre-owned problem dog and for her we needed every dog device available. This crate allowed us to bring her indoors on our workdays which made her a lot happier. We chose the biggest crate we could find that would fit in the back of a Ford Explorer Sportrac. You have to fold it up, then put it in the backseat and open it. The crate has doors on each end so we could take her on a roadtrip and let her out from either side of the truck. It also folds up into a compact suitcase, excellent for traveling.We never ended up using it in the truck, giving her freedom instead. And we eventually weaned her from needing it in the house and she now has free run. (We wrote a book about how we trained her called Bad Dog to Best Friend).The only reason I knock off a star is because we didn't feel confident that it was 100% secure if she decided to try to bully her way out or tinker with the door latch. We reinforced it to make sure with metal clips. That said, none of the crates we looked at would have been any more secure than this one and a cage-like crate is a must if you have a dog that chews.The tray slides right out and is very easy to clean. Almost forgot to mention that it has a divider so you could buy one for a full grown dog but put the divider in to make it smaller for when he's a puppy. The divider could also be used to separate two smaller dogs when traveling etc. (or even cats for that matter)",dogs,3
I used this heater on a 50 gallon planted tank running inline with a rena xp3 canister filter. When I switched my tank over to start reef keeping it just didnt seem to work any more. It was only 6 mos old when it croaked. I still have it but haven't tried it again in a year. I am thinking that my initial reef tank was too small and there was not enough tank volume for it to work properly. I now use a Catalina 500w titanium heater in the sump of my 60 tall reef. I wont buy another one I cant trust its reliability now. I have a 3000.00 reef system and need reliable equipment.,fish aquatic pets,4
"After doing countless hours of research, and an exhaustive ""taste test"" of just about every brand of wet and dry cat foods out there (nutritious, and not so nutritious) Holistic select came out as one of the clear winners. We have 2 cats, 1 is 3 years old and quite healthy, and one is 9 years old and came to us with a myriad of health problems a couple years ago. In addition to teeth problems, our older cat suffers from IBS like symptoms. He has a hard time keeping food down, he is prone to diarrhea, and is a very hard keeper. We tried this kibble after trying everything from Purina Cat Chow, to Wellness Core, just to try and get some weight on him. To complicate things, not only is he a hard keeper, but a VERY picky eater. He will often eat something for a week or two, and then turn his nose up at it for no apparent reason. This kibble was different. In comparison to others, he had far fewer digestive issues, and ate it very happily for almost a year. We saw a huge improvement in his coat quality and energy level and he put on quite a bit of weight ( a good thing in his case). We did eventually stop feeding this kibble as we decided to switch to a raw diet for both of our cats (with great success), but for anyone not willing to do raw, I would recommend this brand very enthusiastically. We did not have good luck getting them to eat the wet food of this brand, but they both really liked the kibble.All that said, I only give this product 4 stars because of some of the added ingredients. Part of the reason we switched to a raw diet was to control what was going into their food. There are a lot of unnecessary ingredients like veggies, berries, and rice, that I would not choose to feed in normal circumstances. I like this brand because they leave out a lot of the common fillers like corn and wheat, and add in great things like probiotics, but it still isn't perfect. I also wouldn't normally choose to feed dry food of any kind, but again we were willing to feed anything to this cat to get some weight and good nutrition back into him!Overall, as far as commercial dry diets go, We think this is a great option. The ingredients are thoughtful (if not all necessary), the food seems to be very palatable for picky eaters, and did great things for our cat with a super sensitive digestive tract!",cats,2

"We are located in Colombia, south america, where this filter is hard to find. The filter is little to medium size, but in 48 hours makes your water so clear that the fish look like flying on air...We use it to clean our tanks, it does a great cleaning job, this filter is ready to use, it comes with activated carbon, hoses, etc... all you need is a little hose cutting (to match tank hight), and plug the power cord...The filter has been working for over a month now... absolutly NO problem! Weve changed the normal cartridge to the ""Polishing"" one... just amazing!...

I love this product as I cannot stand the fur all over the place and wanted to get rid of the dogs for that very reason, which made my husband very upset. Now, I am happy and so are the dogs and my husband. My husband loves brushing them daily and they love getting ""furminated""!!",cats,2
"I love this collar on my dog,,,the color o f it matches with my dog""s so you can see a nice combination!!!",dogs,3
"It's hard to tell if my dog has benefited much from the oil. She's been on it for about a year, 2x daily. Then again, she's about 11 years old and her coat is beginning to change, less shinny and vibrant. I continue with the oil because I think it's beneficial to have it in her system. It's sort of like the yoga I practice...it's designed to ""maximize potential and minimize liability."" My hope is that the oil does just that.",dogs,3
"I am absolutely pleased with this item!! I was a little skeptical at first since it was so cheap compared to other sites and pet stores, but I give this item 100% satisfaction!! Our cats love it! The only downfall (which isn't the company's fault, it's the fault of the FURminator maker's) is that there aren't any directions. It doesn't tell you how often you should use the product, how much pressure to use, how long the blade lasts, or even how to use the FURminator. We use the FURminator about once a week on both of our cats (both short-haired tabby's) and it seems to keep the shedding down, at least for one of our cats... the other cat, has a MAJOR shedding problem, and this seems to help a little bit, but maybe we just need to use it more often on her. Either way, it does still help!!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any cat owner!! Not only does it help eliminate a lot of shedding, it leaves your cat's coat super shinny and soft!",cats,2
"I bought this cage 4 months ago for my son's hamster. Hammy had a huge 3 story cage but began chewing on the bars, so I love that this cage doesn't have any bars for the hammy to chew on. This cage is kinda small, but will work for 1 hamster. We are adding to it to keep hammy happy. The cage comes with a large base in which the hamster can burrow in the bottom, we fill this with bedding and hammy loves to sleep down there. The ""second level"" is not really a level per se, but more a feeding tray with a small built in dish for food. The cage comes with a water bottle that I like, and didn't take hammy too long to learn to use it. The top part is wobbly, but won't fall over or anything. Our hammy sometimes sleeps in that part. The wheel does get squeaky after a while, but you could oil it if it bothers you. Our hammy is in the living room, so this doesn't bother us. The wheel is nice, though, and has a little part underneath to catch any pee or poopies that end up in the wheel. This cage was easy to put together and features two locks on the sides for security. The top of the cage that opens up is great for feeding hammy. The side also opens to access a burrowed hammy. The wheel opening can be flipped over to close off the wheel for cleaning or if you don't want the hammy in the wheel. All in all, we love this cage, and plan on adding some more pieces.",small animals,5
"This FURminator works great! The thing is, my cats won't let me use it on them. Two of my cats love to be brushed (the third can't be bothered) but no matter how gentle I am they won't stick around for the FURminator. But it really does work. Lots of excess hair in just a moment, and a moment is all I get. They do like the ZoomGroom (also available on Amazon) and it will get quite a bit of hair off of them. I've tried with the FURminator for about a month now and two or three swipes is all I get. Maybe if your cats are more laid back than mine they will go for it. Like I said, it really works.",cats,2
I would say these are good for dogs 30lbs and under. They're pretty small. My dog hasn't destroyed them yet so they're pretty sturdy!,dogs,3
"This collar works great with my dog. I only have to put it on him every once in awhile to keep him from barking. It only needs to spray towards him once then he stops with a little startle. But after that he doesn't even need to wear it for a few days, I think he is not sure if he is wearing it or not. Then once he starts up again with any little noise I put it back on. Good on keeping him quiet with out hurting him..",dogs,3
"This crate has been a life-saver. For years I have been reluctant to use a crate, but read-up on how to use it and make it into a refuge the dog wants to go into. The puppy likes it and it is a great way to contain a pet when you need supervision time off.Easy to set-up; sturdy; great price compared to pet store prices. A bit noisy, but solved putting a folded old quilt on botton. Easy access and very easy clean-up. So far has been safe for very active English Springer Spaniel pup. Glad I got a much larger size than the one recommended for ESS. I can put water dish in crate and use rear for sleeping.",dogs,3
"This review is easy to write:- pumps bubbles good- 'whisper' is misleading, because these pumps are very buzzy, noisy.I have 3- 27 gallon aquariums and 3 Whisper pumps. They are all the same, with the same noise problem.

"MY cat urinated in the back seat of my car on the way to the vet, and I stupidly waited a day to clean it out, because I thought it would just evaporate. Well, it did evaporate, but the stink remained.My sister told me about Anti-Icky-Poo (she's a vet), but I didn't want to spend the money (it seemed pricey, and I couldn't get anything less than a quart, which is more than I needed). I thought I could take care of it with vinegar, baking soda, carpet cleaner, and a wet vacuum. It seemed fine for a few days, but the stink returned. Then I tried a pet odor remover from my local store (which cost about $7), and then OdoBan($4-5) - both seemed to initially work when I sprayed them on, but after they dried, the odor returned. The OdoBan worked fairly well, but there was still a slight stink, especially if the car is closed up tight.I finally caved, after 4 weeks, when I came home to my car that was parked for 3 days at the airport, and was greeted by overwhelming cat urine smell. As soon as I got the Anti-Icky-Poo, I sprayed it on my car seat before I went to sleep. To my amazement, the next day when I entered the car, there was absolutely NO smell of cat urine. I went to work, and at the end of the day, the car was still fresh. I re-applied it once more on sections of the cushion I missed (I had to do a really close sniff test to detect any remaining odor), and sure enough, the smell is gone almost instantly.I am really happy with the product, and I recommend it. I just wish they made a smaller size, but at least I'll be prepared if I have to rescue some carpet or upholstery in the future.",cats,2

"We bought this litter box to replace a non-frill open box. It is certainly an upgrade from that but our cats often skip over the steps and carry the litter out of the box nonetheless. The steps are also hard to clean without getting your hands dirty. The product is rather oddly shaped at the bottom so you can't line the bottom with a plastic bag well. Also, the interior of the dome requires cleaning fairly often as cats splash onto the dome. The air-filter is quite useless as the odor escapes from the front opening. One of our cats is quite big and from time to time will knock the top half of the dome over and splash the litter all over the place. I think for the price, you are much better off getting the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box. We also own that box and it works much better at containing the litter and also is much easier for cleaning. The only complaint that I have about that system is if you overfill the box with litter, the cats can kick the litter out of the front opening as they try to cover up their wastes.",cats,2
This is an awesome product. Works great. I love on the Chesapeake Bay and need something that kills mosquitos organically - this product is it!!,dogs,3
IAMS Savory Sauce is a must have for dogs that don't eat dry dog food well. Our dog started to not eat her food as well until we tried the Savory Sauce. We haven't looked back since and neither has our dog. We have ordered them by the case now and only requires 5-6 drops of the sauce. The only downfall is the dog's breath right after eating is not all that pleasant. That does go away soon but is tolerabe. Just don't recommend the dog licking you right after! Great Product!,dogs,3

"My two cats are both front declawed. This was great until I bought two leather chairs that the cats like to use as a spring board. I bought the soft paws for their rear claws. So far the first application has been on over 3 weeks. No more scratches on the chairs, and the cats don't even notice them - plus they are colored which is cute. One of my cats also spooks easily and has a history of shooting right off your lap or out of your arms when she hears an unexpected noise. This was a problem with our young daughter and she had been accidentally clawed a few times. With the soft paws, this is no longer an issue. You definitely don't want to get scratched by the same claws that dig around the litter box. The soft paws are great and I will definitely be keeping them on hand. No more pulled thread snags in the couch, scratches on the leather or accidental injuries to us. They are also easy to apply, and the thin applicator tip makes it easy not to use too much. Five stars for this product!p.s. My cats are a 9 pound female and 14 pound male. I use size medium for both their rear claws. Make sure you nip the tip of their claw with clippers before you apply the soft paws.",cats,2

"I had two litter box issues. One, I needed high sides because my cat's peeing habits left much to be desired, but who wants to see the the cat do her business? So I usually went for covered boxes, but most had poorly designed joins between lid and base which allowed urine to leak out. Two, my cat had a tendency to do her business and then rocket out of the litter box spraying litter everywhere behind her in the process. I had to sweep up the bathroom multiple times a day. I finally got the Clevercat Top Entry Litter box, and hooray no more puddles and no more sweeping! My 10 year-old cat adjusted to it quickly and had no difficulty getting in and out.",cats,2
"My cats go wild for the small fur mice, and I assumed it would be much the same with these foam ones. But cats are particular creatures and the cat engineering specialist that designed these did not do enough research into the likes and dislikes of kittens. The mice's hard texture turns my kitties off, they don not like to bite them. The shape is probably also not realistic enough, and although the these toys tumble well across a hardwood floor, my Misha and Kabanos have both decidedly said NO to the soft bite mice.",cats,2
"I have a 6in turtle and 40 gallon tank. I fill the tank just below the filter outlet where the water comes out. The problem is that from there to top the filter is not well designed for turtle to climb up. it is too steep for the turtle to climb. I have to shop for another filter. Water cleaning is just ok. If the water is too low, the filter stops working so make sure the tank is filled way up close to the outlet.",fish aquatic pets,4

I have purchased four of these over the years and all are still in ""like new"" condition. Worth the extra bucks!",cats,2
"So much more attractive than the old VittlesVaults. Very easy to use and clean because the whole opaque lid snaps off. My dog has been know to break into garbage cans/food bags, and I've had no problem with this container. But I have known other dogs who are clever/determined enough to remove the lids from old-style VVs if the lid isn't super tightly spun shut, and I think those dogs could pretty easily remove this lid from the snap on section.",cats,2
These treats are awesome in the fact that they are designed for the Kong toy. We used to come home to something chewed up almost eveerytime we left are dog home alone. Ever since we got these and the toy we have yet to get something chewed up. We simply just smear some peanut butter in the whole and stick a treat in there and she is busy for hours.,dogs,3

"The Solvit Bench Seat For Pets is doing the job for us. It is a nice fit to our rear bench seat and attaches fairly well. Our dog is a minature schnauzer so we don't experience any movement of the cover although he is tethered while in the seat and on the cover. The durability seems very good although it hasn't been used too much as of yet. The only recommendation for the manufacture would be to offer the cover in several colors to match the interior of newer automobile i.e gray. All in all, satisfied with our purchase and the job it is doing.",dogs,3

He will love being in the front seat between us when we are both traveling with him. I'll just have to take the things I need out of the compartment.",dogs,3

The pen folds flat very nicely, only complaint is that it is a little heavy. But that's what you get when you're getting heavy duty pen. My dog (5 months / 6 lbs) pushes up against the sides and jumps, but has never been able to knock it over. Great pen to have!",dogs,3
"My cat suffered kidney failure thanks to stupid Metacam (don't ever let your vet put your cat on this stuff!!). He declined rapidly on it, within less than a week he was no longer moving much and not eating at all. The damage was so great that even daily sub-Q fluids alone could not stabilize his kidney function. Eventually (and just in time), I found that doing a combination of Azodyl twice/day and daily sub-Q fluids did the trick and his kidney function has greatly improved. In my situation, it didn't ""cure"" kidney failure. But given how old my cat is and the extent of damage he suffered, it certainly helped buy him an extra year of life now and still going strong! He's behaving like his normal self again, but the regiment needs to be continued for him to maintain this level of functionality. I'd say this is some pretty darn good stuff!",cats,2
"I have been using this on my two large dogs in differing doses for two years. They are 80 and 120 lbs a piece, 8 & 10 years old.

The cube itself is still being used to stuff other toys into yet it has holes and is losing stuffing from time to time. The smaller toys aren't long in lifespan but the cube is moderate. Decent toy. If you want a better toy with the same concept go for the squeaky squirrels in the tree stump the same manufacturer makes. That one is worth it.This one is decent overall.",cats,2

"Since I recently got two puppies, I wanted a way to crate them together yet give both a little private space to retreat to if desired. I assumed I could place the divider right down the middle so each puppy could share in a ""duplex"" situation. Well, that definitely does not work. If you place the divider in the center, you have to attach it to the door. If you attach it to one side so the door can still be opened, that closed-in side becomes useless. So, I had to go Petsmart and purchase 2 additional Midwest metal dog crates. That solution works, but their play area inside the exercise pen has been dramatically reduced in size because the 2 crates take up so much more space than just the one. Later, I learned I could have purchased a three-door crate that just might have been perfect. Oh well, you learn from your mistakes. Since the crate was well-made and would have worked for just one dog, I gave the product 4 stars.",dogs,3
"I have 2 dogs, one is almost 5 and one is coming up on 2 years. The younger still has some puppy in her and wants to pull on occasion.

"This appears to be EXACTLY the same box as the Petmate Giant Litter Pan sold on Amazon as the dimensions are the same (except rounded up)and this one is more money. There are hundreds of reviews for the Petmate Giant Litter Pan -some of them by dog owners. below is my Petmate Giant Litter Pan review page.Although I KNEW from reading the reviews this litter box is big. One box side has a slight curve which makes it appear not so wide and when actually on the ground it doesn't seem so big either. My 4 cats, 2 of which like to dig, love it. One of the side pockets holds a huge litter box scoop and the other side holds a 4lb open box of baking soda and a small plastic spray bottle which I filled with Fabreeze.The cat box smell is GONE!The cat litter bed is so large that a lot can be put into it before it smells. Because it is so big, it is easier to scoop. It uses 1 and 1/2 boxes of Wal-Mart's Special Kitty Scoopable cat litter (EXACTLY same as Scoopaway but cheaper). And, I scoop and dump into an empty Scoopaway plastic container lined with a plastic grocery bag. When the top is on that Scoopaway box, zero scent escapes. When box is full, remove plastic bag, tie off and dump in outside trash can. Spray the Fabreeze located on the side litter box pocket into the Scoopaway box BEFORE putting in the plastic garbage bag/lid back on and viola - no more smells. I even pour the extra Wal-Mart Special Kitty scoopable cat litter which comes in a cardboard container into an empty Tidy Cat for Multiply cats plastic box (love the orange lid - but litter too tracky/grainy) plastic container and then stack the scoopaway plastic poop box on top of it.

This is her favorite spot in the whole house. It is also very adjustable. I have a small ledge already on my window and I was worried it wouldn't fit, because most won't but I had no troubles.

"Our Great Pyrenees / Border Collie mix had ACL surgery and developed an obvious miniscus (?) click. We were advised to get a Glucosamine HCL 500mg & Chondroitin Sulfate 400mg supplement. This product is a perfect match. The recommended dosage was 3/day; 2 in the morning and 1 in the evening. No click found at the 30-day recheck appointment. (We think the click disappeared even earlier).While dealing with the ACL problem, our veterinarian found evidence of arthritis in the joint (most likely the result of a really, really severe case of ehrlichiosis). Even though the miniscus click is no longer an issue, we've been advised that this supplement would continue to be helpful, even with 1 pill per day.Because he's a large breed and 6 years old, but mostly because we've seen such great results, we've decided just to stay at the recommended ""best dosage"" of 3 pills per day until he's fully recovered from the ACL event.

"I ordered this litter box 2 weeks ago and I actually look forward to cleaning the litter box - I love it!!!! I have have 3 large cats and have used automatic litter boxes and super jumbo regular boxes - this box is well worth the money. its so easy to clean out the waste and no more liners to worry about - no more torn messes! I almost want to buy another to give my cats another option! I also started using World's Best Cat litter which is quite pelasant as well. If you have ever said ""there has to be a better way"" when crouching and sifting and adding more litter - the answer is ""the omega paw"". Plus it really does use a lot less litter! A++++++",cats,2
The price is right for this product. Both of my dogs absolutely love this bone. I like it because they cannot chew off pieces of it. They do grind it down but seem to really love doing that. I would definitely recommend this product through Amazon. Price is outrageous in the pet stores.,dogs,3
"The collar works great. Within two days of putting it on one of my dogs, she had stopped the raucous barking that always accompanied my husband returning home. It doesn't keep her quiet all of the time, but her barking is down to a very reasonable level. We liked it so much, we bought another one for one of our other dogs, who also had a tendency to bark too much.",dogs,3
"I used to work in a grooming salon, and this brush works well on short coated dogs - Danes, Bulldogs, and others with similar coat. This isn't something I would recommend for dogs with undercoat. Also, it is a pain that the hair doesn't collect in the brush and instead falls to the floor, BUT I would rather get it out in one sitting then deal with my dog shedding over everything!",cats,2
My two boys love these little critters. They became an instant favorite in the toy box. Seriously recommend them for kitties that love to play. They are small so any size kitten would enjoy,cats,2
"Ok, I have 4 cats, and I have tried every known brush/comb/tool imaginable with only frustration. With brushes, you have to manually pull all of the hair out of the brush... not to mention they don't pick up that much hair in the first place. Plus, I was always feeling like the hair was flying all around the room and tickling my nose and getting all over my hands and face and... I was like, there has GOT to be a better way.EUREKA! I went to PetsMart to find out if they had any latest and greatest brushes. I found the ""Furminator"" and chuckled about the name and was very skeptical about the effectiveness of the product, since I've had NO luck in the past. It didn't have a price on it, but I thought, how much could it be? $10 or so? I went to the register and she rang it up, $37 please. I was like, ""WHAT??? No ma'm, I just had this brush, that can't be right"". Anyway, I thought I'd give it a shot, as I was desperate. Took it home and fell in love with it to say the least. But, after I saw that Amazon had them for $20 each, I was like, ""Shoot, I could get 2 Furminator's on Amazon for the price of only 1 at PetsMart. So, I returned the one back to PetsMart (it had a 30-day money back guarantee) and now I'm going to buy TWO Furminators on Amazon. This way my wife and I can tag-team and get the 4 cats done faster. This thing removes SOOOOOOOO much hair you won't believe your eyes. Your cats will thank you and their coat will feel SOOOOOOOOOO much better/smoother/glossier/healthier-looking and feeling.TRUST ME, it is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH EASIER to remove it from your cats/dogs than it is to remove it from your carpets, beds, couches, etc... Its a no-brainer... BUY ONE (or 2 or 3 or 4 :)",cats,2
"Got these for my booda dome for my cat. they come square shaped and they do fit the dome but it doesn't line the litter box well because of movement. My cat likes to bury around in his litter box sometimes and the edges end up caving in so you're stuck with litter getting underneath it. I usually end up taping the liner to the box to prevent it from moving around so much, but my cat does end up putting holes in them. It works in that it does keep most of the litter in the liner and makes it easier to clean up the litter box without worrying about scrubbing. I tried using trashbags before, but the one's I have aren't big enough so if you decide to go that route, make sure you get the bigger ones. I think I had the regular kitchen tall trash bags which didn't fit.",cats,2
"I have a rescue dog that tends to inhale his food so fast he ends up throwing it up right after he eats. I started using these to help slow down his eating pace and make his brain work at the same time. Now he gets annoyed if he has to eat out of a bowl. There is a lip inside of the ball that makes it harder to get the treats out than other items I have tried. He only gets this toy at meal time and when he thinks I have forgotten, he will sit and whine at the place where these are stored. Might not work for everyone, but my boxer/pitbull loves it.",dogs,3

With in two hours of opening the box, the squeeker died.I won't buy another and I can't really recommend it, but I gave it three stars because my dog's still crazy about it. She likes the odd bounce it can take when I throw it. Sadly, I don't expect it to last much longer... holes are starting to develop around the seams.--",dogs,3

"I thought this would be a good alternative to keep my 6 month old pup from ripping the stuffing out of his toys. He loves the squeaker egg things, but that didn't stop him from still ripping apart the platypus that laid them. It says the opening for the eggs is elastic, but that was very easily ripped apart. He can play with the corpse but trust me it can still be destroyed. And now it just looks like I've given my dog squeaky platypus testicles to play with. :\",dogs,3
I have 2 dogs- one of them (the one that doesn't bark!)was very afraid of it and stopped doing whatever she was doing when the device went off.

It only went off when I press the button or when people are talking loudly. It is going back to the store and we are trying something different.,dogs,3
"I like ""Home Again"" chip makers and their services. I have 2 other pets that were chipped with ""Home Again"" micro-chip, so it was no brainier to get our new 4-legged family member get the same chip.

I have three labs and the oldest one sheds mountains of fur all year long. I use the brush for cleaning his bed and spots on the carpert and it works great.

"This is the first time we're using a crate for a dog, but we just adopted a 14 month-old shelter puppy and she was gnawing and pooping her way through the house. We decided against a plastic travel crate because we want the puppy to have lots of ventilation in case the power goes out and it gets warm in the house while she's crated. This had great reviews and the price was right. It was easy to put together and the two doors gave us alot of options regarding where to place it. She's 35 pounds and we chose the 36lx24wx27h which fits her just fine with enough room to grow but not enough to want to soil the floor. We also picked up the Midwest Stainless Steel Snap'y Fit Water and Feed Bowl. We were very hesitant about crating because our other adopted dogs were older, didn't need to be crated and if felt cruel to pen her up, but we're glad we listened to the experts. She's content in the crate (she even came out of it to bring a few of her times inside) and it eases our mind for the short periods of time we're out of the house.",dogs,3
"Jack, one of our 4 Labs, is obsessed with retrieving... as long as he's retrieving a Ringo Ball. It has to be a RED Ringo Ball; he won't touch the blue ones. And once the large ring comes off, he won't even look at it. Since Ringo Balls are no longer being produced, and Jack is only 7, I'm thrilled to have found another red Ringo Ball to keep him happy! The Ringo Balls last a long time, but the large ring comes off after a while, which is what I view as built-in obsolescence.",dogs,3
"I noticed that my dog was occasionally lifting it's hind leg when running around. I did some research and many websites advised to give glucosamine treats with fish oil to help heal the joints. Since I have done so, my dog is running around at full speed again and I have not seen her limping. She eats these from my hand as a treat a few times a day. They are also pretty cool looking--little blue fish. I would recommend this if your dog is starting to develop joint problems--I heard it's good for the coat too, but I did not purchase this product for that.",dogs,3

"I hoped from all the great reviews that I had finally found a litter box to love. Nope. It's OK, but far from the best ever. I have a tiny bathroom and this thing does take a lot of room to turn and the screen will not stay in place. When the screen stays where it is supposed to, it does not catch all the small pieces either. However, it is nice to just pull out the drawer and dump the clumps. But that's assuming everything went well when the thing was rolled. It's not the best, it's not the worst. I'll still use it, but for me, it's just average.",cats,2
"I think it really all varies on the individual dog, but mine loves this ball.It's been difficult for me to find the perfect treat dispensing toy that dispenses the right amount at the right time.

Or if anyone knows where I can find one, please let me know? My dog is small so a smaller size would work much better for her to carry around.",dogs,3

"Can't tell you how much feed I've wasted in this feeder. Finally just threw the feeder away. The squirrels just land on top of it, hook their foot on the hanger, lean over the side and put their other foot on the seed port (totally bypassing the door that's supposed to close). Then they lean in and gobble up the seed. In addition, the raccoons get on top of it at night and shake it until all the seed just falls out. I've tried adding a dome over the top, a longer hanging arm so that they have to jump father to get on top of it, a lighter setting on the counterweight (which meant it closed when the birds alighted on it). Nothing has worked. The squirrels simply outwit this feeder which totally defeats its intended purpose.",birds,0
She smacks these around. She likes to get them out and put them under the edge of the bed so when i vacuum they get sucked up and clog the vacuum cleaner. She does this on purpose.

"We have a very large, 10-month old Boxer named Murphy. He is a normal Boxer and loves to pull as he's being walked. His strength made it impossible for my 10-year old daughter to walk him or even take him outside. I knew that Boxers loved to pull and began looking for an option that would allow us to enjoy him more outside. It was during this time that I found the Easy Walk Pet Harness and placed my order.The first day I got the harness and placed it on our dog. The adjustments were simple enough that it did not take too much time to make it fit. I ordered according to Easy Walk Pet Harness' sizing chart, however, I found my ""large"" harness fit larger than I'd hoped. If I were to do it again, I would have ordered the ""med-large"" instead of the ""large."" Due to this sizing discrepancy, I had to place the fittings at their tightest position. When I did this it barely was tight enough to fit. The good-point for me is since Murphy is only 10-months; the larger size will give him room to grow. I wasn't sure how Murphy would take to the harness, but once it was on him, other than being curious, he did not act as if it bothered him much at all. I then took him outside and was amazed at the instant difference. Before, when the leash was on his collar, he would pull and jerk trying to get it to go further than the leash's 6' length. With the Easy Walk Pet Harness, he was much calmer and barely pulled against the leash at all. Next came the big test; my daughter. When she came home from school she saw the harness she wanted to try walking Murphy. For our test we went to the school across from our house. I tried Murphy first and he walked on my left side, just like he was taught in obedience school (well, he was taught, but never obeyed much afterward). I then gave the leash to my daughter. It was amazing! Murphy walked perfectly beside her...perfectly! The school yard had 10-15 kids playing in various areas. Before he would have been pulling like crazy to get to those kids (he loves to play). But with this harness, my daughter kept him on the sidewalk little effort. She now takes him for daily walks and volunteers to take him outside.I liked the results I got from this harness so much that I sent its Amazon link to my niece. She has a 3-year old Boxer that she has never been able to walk without a struggle. After seeing how well this harness worked for my big-brute, I feel confident it will work for her Boxer too.Bottom line, placing the leash attachment ring at the dog's front chest-area does give the dog owner much more control over their dog. I would buy the Easy Walk Pet Harness again without hesitation.",dogs,3

"My small dog LOVES this toy. She even plays with it when there is no food inside. She figured out how to get the food out rather quickly, but I think it is still fun for her to roll it around and nibble every once in a while. She is also a tad bit heavy and has lots of energy, so I think this is a great way to get her to eat. I found it to be better than the wobble food dispenser because it requires a bit more energy to get the food out, which allows her to spend more time running around.",dogs,3
"The Hide a Squirrel dog toy is the best toy I've ever bought for my 3 westies. All three dogs love it, but Luigi, 2 years old, is nearly obsessed with it. Luigi has destroyed every other squeaky toy in the house, but seems to be satisfied with the ""destruction"" of removing the squirrels from the tree. He carries the squirrels around everywhere, grooms them, and sleeps with them. Our only ""injury"" to a squirrel came during an unusually strong tug-of-war (a tail came off). It's great to be able to purchase replacement squirrels. A definite must-have for terriers!",dogs,3

"I previously wrote a review for the chicken, so I couldn't update it there. Please see my Other Reviews , the one for Septmber 30th so you can fully understand my follow-up about the change in ingredients below.Kind of funny, I waited for 3 months to hear back from the manufacturer of Gennies Pill Pockets about their change in their ingredients and since posting this on 9/30, I received an e-mail, finally, on 10/2, coinsidence, maybe. Here is what they stated:""Thank you for contacting Greenies with your inquiry.The only change we have made in the formula for Feline Pill Pockets is an increase in Glycerin to insure moisture content. There have been no changes to any of the protein sources.Please feel free to contact us anytime! John X. Consumer Quality RepresentativeNutro Products Inc.Please do NOT reply to this email. If you would like to respond to this message, click on the link below."" I changed the customer reps name to John X. to leave her name out of it.I e-mailed them back to inform them of their misinformation and suggested they revert back to the orignal ingredients. There wouldn't be need for extra glycerin if they didn't mess with the original recipe.I guess NO ONE there is aware of what they put or no longer put in their products that our pets eats. Just read for yourself, there is no mention of any type of probiotic. Their statement ""Healthy Treat"" went by the wayside after they removed the probiotics.With the recent pet food scare, I would want to buy from a manufacturer who is aware of not only where they buy their ingredients, but of every tiny particle that is used in producing their product.So, use your judgement. I will use pill pockets ONLY if I HAVE to medicate.By the way, I gave it 3 stars for pill dosing, not for quality or healthy ingredients.",cats,2
"Do not let the simplicity of the design fool you (a fairly springy wire with bits of rolled cardboard at the ends) - no cat can resist! Every cat we've owned over the years (and any cat we've given one of these to) ADORES this toy.The wire is much tougher than you would think, and it's unpredictable, darting movements work with the little bits of cardboard - guess it must resemble a bug or something when in movement. We've tried attaching a small bit of string to the end, but our cats have always preferred it sans string.Since the wire comes coiled, you might want to straighten it a bit before you use it; depending how intensely your cats play, you might want some distance between your fingers and their claws!",cats,2
"I own a 19 pound dachshund mix, a shelter rescue. Before I got this collar, he would bark hysterically and lunge at any passing bicyclist, jogger, skateboarder, or general adolescent male on our walks (and at the postman's truck, and at the garbage truck . . . and at the school bus). He would also bark at strangers coming into the house. I tried many methods to train him to stop, but nothing worked. I have had the collar for nine months now, and it is a godsend.The collar has changed everything. The first time I put it on him, it took three barks for him to learn to stop. By coincidence, on that first walk, some city workers were trimming trees in the neighborhood. These workers were wearing bright orange vests and held whirring chainsaws. What would have sent him into a frenzy the day before now left him unfazed. No hackles raised, nothing. It was as if he did not even notice them.Behaviorally, he had a difficult time around people when I first adopted him. He wasn't properly socialized. The barking didn't help -- people could never get close to him, and he remained afraid and aggressive toward them. Now, he is vastly improved, and can meet new people and be nothing but sweet to them. He still wears the collar almost every day. He does not mind it at all, but I admit it looks somewhat ridiculous hanging there on his tiny neck. Still, it has changed both our lives. He is much better adjusted dog now, and I am certain that this collar has given him a chance to live a better life and behave in a healthy way. I strongly recommend the spray sense collar.",dogs,3

You use to be able to use these for flying with your dog but the airlines have changed their standards which I think is good as these do come apart and could injure a dog.

"It's hard to fathom how Littermaid could produce the LM900 & LM950, both terrific products, and follow them up with a piece of garbage like the Elite Mega. Our Elite jams daily, even when only half-filled with litter. If you fill it with litter to the ""full"" line, the rake can't even get through the clean litter. If one of our cats should actually use the box, forget about it!A few specifics:1) The drive motor is clearly not up to the task, and is very noisy.2) The controls are electronic, which means that the slightest AC power glitch will leave the unit powered off. This also clears the clock and any ""downtime"" you may have programmed in.3) There is no ""cycle"" button; the only way to get the unit to cycle is to power it off and on again (see point 2).4) The ionic air cleaner appears to be little more than a green LED.

"I bought this bowl for my Bernese Mountain Dog Puppy. It packs up very small and is easy to carry around. It holds plenty of water. I haven't tried using it for food yet since he eats raw food. The only bad thing I can say is it doesn't stay perfectly open, sometimes it collapses in and spills water. But it is fine for outside use as long as you are okay with it spilling sometimes.",dogs,3
"The 6 ft black Mendota slip lead was much less flexible and less soft than the 4-ft woodlands (color) Mendota slip lead. The weave is much tighter and it is more difficult to adjust the leather slide. For some this might be seen as an advantage, but I prefer the softer, looser weave--the leather slide on the Woodlands-colored Mendota 4-ft lead holds fine, and I have large German Shepherds. All in all, I really like the leads but am puzzled and somewhat disappointed that the black one is not as flexible/soft as the woodlands one. Both are 1/2"" leads and both were ordered within a month of each other.",dogs,3
"Our Vet recommended this for our newly adopted dog, who had scabies and other skin conditions from being at the shelter. Within two weeks, his skin and coat was much more healthy looking and within a month, his coat was super soft! We add this to his food every morning and he seems to love it. I'm sure it had other health benefits, but we just love what it's done to his coat so far!",dogs,3
"I bought the same unit about 3 years ago in which it worked fine for about 2 years and then around year two my neighbor came running to me after going out to get some groceries for about 45 minutes with my dog in hand.

"We love this shampoo. I know a few people had said that it caused itching and irritation on there dog. I have a Jack Russell, short coat. I have been using it for awhile and we haven't seen any problems. I would say if your dog has sensitive skin, this might not be for you. The bottle pictured is different from what you will receive. I guess they changed the original but shampoo is the same. No ""wet rat"" smell here after the bath. Nice scent!",cats,2

"The reviews discussing the annual fees are incorrect. Home Again does not charge an annual fee to keep your contact information in the data base.They have a very nice app for Android which shows lost pets and tracks them on a map.Home Again's customer service has been very polite.There is one very important lesson I learned regarding Home Again. If you adopt a pet from a shelter they will not allow you to transfer the primary contact information to your name and number without permission from the shelter. We adopted a puppy and the owner of the shelter (a stranger I will never see again) refuses to give-up the primary contact. This was never discussed or put in a contract. That means this stranger will be the primary contact for my dog's entire life span due to Home Again's policies. Home Again will not allow you to become the primary contact for your family dog if the previous owner is affiliated with a shelter and refuses to give-up permission. Trust me, I have had numberous conversations with Home Again and received a letter from Home Again denying my request to be the primary contact for my dog. I don't know if other micro-chip companies have the same policy but I thought it may save another pet owner the frustration we are experiencing with Home Again. Get it in writing from the shelter when adopting your dog or Home Again will leave you with no alternative. They seem to be a good company which provides a great service (every dog should be chipped) but this policy will prevent me from being my dog's primary contact if he ever gets lost.",dogs,3

"This fountain is quiet, well designed, and holds a very large amount of water (3 reservoirs full), but neither of my cats will drink from it. They still insist on using their normal water bowl, which is a shame since I was hoping they would be attracted to drink more to help their feline urinary crystal issues. Put side by side, they utterly ignore the fountain.The motor was initially very buzzy, vibrating against the hard plastic ""prongs"" surrounding it and the plastic base. I found that the suction cups on the bottom where it contacts the fountain bowl base were just compressed too far. I pulled it up and reset it, and it was loads quieter with almost no vibration. Now it sounds almost entirely like falling water, with a quiet hum behind it.",cats,2

What can I say but our dog (Doberman / Chihuahua mix) loves this. Never tried it myself but she devours it.

"The best method of use for this brush is what I like to call the rock and roll. Just place it in the fur and rock it back-ward then pull up.

"Our cat absolutely loves these.She literally will play fetch with these mice. I throw one, she runs and retrieves it, picks it up in her mouth, carries it back to me and meows until I throw it again. When I'm watching TV, she'll bring one in and drop it at my feet when she wants me to throw it again. It's like having a dog that knows how to use the litter box.One thing to note - I bought another set (the ""Zanies"" mice) that don't have a rattle inside. Our cat will still chase after them and play with them, but she doesn't seem to go quite as crazy for them and doesn't bring them back to me when I throw them. Seems strange that a rattle could make that much of a difference, but it does.Aside from playing fetch, her other favorite game (and my least favorite) is batting them under the radiator, dishwasher, couch, and any other dark place that's tough to reach, then getting excited when I take out the flashlight and yardstick to retrieve them.",cats,2

"I bought this particular product because there were several very positive reviews on other products made by the maker of this particular piece (even though no reviews on this piece at the time), but I liked the design of this one. I have to say that as soon as I started to unpack the shipping box one of my 4 cats took an immediate interest in it, so my only problem while putting it together was keeping the one cat out of the way. Construction of the bungalow was very easy, and I was very pleased with the quality of the materials. Once completed the bungalow provided a very sturdy/stable bungalow for my cats, and the one cat immediately took her position as queen of the bungalow! When I was finally able to relocate the bungalow to its final spot in the corner of my living room all the cats showed interest in it, but the two younger Tuxedo cats (sisters) have now laid claim to it as their own and enjoy it to excess!I highly recommend this to anyone! The only cat that does not use it regularly is my large male cat... while he did actually fit in the room on the 2nd floor, I think he decided to just let the ""ladies"" take ownership ;o)))HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ONE AND ALL!!!",cats,2
"Caring for fish in a very small bowl like this one is stressful both for the fish and the fishkeeper.In a small bowl like this, the fish's waste will build up rapidly (espcially since there is no filter). This causes suffering (for example, eye and skin irritation), sickness, and even death. You can try to prevent this by changing the water frequently; however, frequent water changes are also stressful for the fish. (Not to mention a pain for the fishkeeper!)In addition, the temperature of such a small volume of water will fluctuate rapidly; another source of stress for the fish. You cannot use a heater in a bowl this small.In particular, this bowl is *not* ideal for goldfish and bettas.Goldfish grow to be up to one foot long. Even when they are smaller, they produce a lot of waste. Goldfish need 10-20 gallons of water *each*, and they are schooling fish so you shouldn't have just one.Bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to 80F; there is no way to safely heat a tank smaller than 5 gallons.If you'd like to care for a fish, please read some of the excellent websites out there and learn all you can. (Ignore manufacturers websites, since of course they will say their products are great, even crummy products like this one.) Get the largest tank you can afford. If you can't afford a large enough tank, please don't get the fish.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I agree with the other reviewers who've noted that the perfume scent of this litter is a bit overpowering. Nevertheless, in my opinion this is the best litter we've tried so far, and I'll tell you why. We have 2 cats, and due to space limitations only 1 litter box. One of our cats refuses to use the litterbox when it gets too stinky, and he ends up using the closet or the bathtub. It's a real problem, and with other litters we couldn't keep the box clean enough to prevent these nasty surprises. We noticed that when we tried Scoop Away Multi-cat, in spite of the fact that we're cleaning at the same rate, he consistently uses the box. Well worth the overpowering perfume scent in my opinion. I will look for the unscented variety that was mentioned by another reviewer, but I wonder whether, minus the strong perfume scent, my cat will stop using the litter box again. If I can find the unscented I'll do the experiment and post an update here later.",dogs,3

"Our 5 year old male cat started going out of the litter box after we adopted a puppy. We tried all sorts of things to get him to stop and this litter was part of ""Project Last Resort"" at our house. As I was pouring the litter in the pan he was instantly interested. He immediately climbed in and scratched around. We have 2 cats and I had 3 litter boxes, each with a different litter. I wanted to see if he had a preference. He immediately started using this litter and ignored the others. As a human, this isn't my favorite. The clumps are heavy and sometimes stick to the sides and bottom of the pan a bit. There is no deoderizer so when you scoop you will smell cat pee but I'm not noticing a smell in the room or anything. It's also a bit dusty. You will need to scoop at least 1 time a day and wash the pan well occassionally too. Experts also say you should replace the pan every now and again since they absorb orders (you should do this with all litter). The Elsey website also says to completely replace the litter every 3 - 4 weeks. But, the fact that my cat uses it makes me a convert. It might not work for everyone but it's sure worth a try!",cats,2

"I recently bought the Large Houndabout Pet Bike Trailer for my 65lb dog. As of early summer 2011 I gave up my car and only use a bike as means of transportation. With the trailer I am able to take my fluffy best friend with me everywhere I go. Fortunately, I live in a city that is very bike friendly and allows me to safely ride almost anywhere. Here are my pros and cons about the product.ProsThe dog loves it. I tried using a child's Burley Bike Trailer earlier in the summer, and he was not comfortable with the smaller space. On the Houndabout trailer he loves the sun roof to poke his head through on a ride. He even lays down and sleeps on rides over 2 miles or so. Last week I took him to a frisbee game and it started to rain with no shelter in sight. He voluntarily got in the trailer to stay dry while he slept.There is a good amount of room for him and any extra stuff I might need. I can put a small overnight bag in the trailer with him, and he still has plenty of space to be comfortable. I also use this trailer for groceries, and it holds a great amount.My dog is getting to be a senior and it is not possible for him to walk everywhere we need to go. This trailer is a necessity for my lifestyle. It should be noted that my dog is extremely mellow and well-tempered.ConsThe trailer is very heavy, probably about as much as my dog. I am a smaller female and it is quite a workout, even on mild inclines. I am in excellent shape, but if I were not this trailer would be a big problem for me.It is somewhat cumbersome to store or park. It often takes me and one other person to get it ready or put it away. It is not as user friendly as some of the kid trailers I looked at.*note",cats,2
Have had this item a few weeks now and like everything about it. It's only drawback as I can see is the water circulating noise.It is not loud but always in the background.My Lab seems to like the water better than just being in a bowl.So far it is a great product.,dogs,3
This was a COMPLETE RIPOFF. There were supposed to be 25 count in the package and there was only 1. This was the fault of the company not Amazon.It didn't take long to get credit but I thought it was BS they didn't honor their advertising.I will NEVER buy from them again.,dogs,3
"we ordered this shampoo for our dog Gomez who seems to have very sensitive and dry skin, he gets these itchy patches on his back and tail that are like really bad dandruff. Any parts he could lick or bite were balding and full of painful sores from the biting. We have used this shampoo on him a couple times now and have noticed even from the first wash that he doesn't chew on himself and the flakes on his back were almost completely gone for about a week after his first wash. I don't think it will fix all his skin issues but it gives him so much relief, he seems much more comfortable and happy now that his sores are going away and he doesn't itch...and I can't wait for his hair to start growing back.",dogs,3

I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned. We didn't know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life.

Definitely a great find.,cats,2
"I received this high end water fountain and read the extensive instructions on upkeep. You will need to completely dismantle this unit at least once a month for cleaning and maintenance.

This fountain will allow my dogs to drink clean non stale water all day and will ultimately extend their lives. Isn't that what this purchase is all about? If you love your pets as i do mine, you owe it to them to pamper them a bit.",cats,2

We have have been using frontline Hot Spot on our two big dogs (over 85 pounds each ) ever since our Vet recommended it.

"I own two Siberian Huskies. For most of my older male's life he's had terrible, itchy skin that had a bad odor. I've tried many different shampoos, all different types and brands varying from those bought at my vet to those bought at high-end boutiques. Nothing seemed to really help to give him temporary relief on the itch as well as deodorize. I was recommended this shampoo from a friend and thought I might as well try it out since I've tried so many other things.After one wash I noticed a huge difference! A week after I washed him, the bad skin odor is still not there nor does he seem to be itching himself as much. This product has worked wonders on him as both a deodorizer and a temporary itch relief. I will recommend this to anyone who has been trying shampoo products without any significant success.",cats,2

"My cats and I love this litterbox. I admit, I was sometimes a little lazy with scooping the box, but this box is so easy to ""scoop"" that I don't mind and am able to keep up with it everyday.My only complaint is the locks to hold the lid and the bottom together are a little hard to slide into place, and they still allow some litter to seep through when you turn them over. But we keep our boxes in the basement so it isn't a big deal.Definitely get the large size if you don't have tiny cats...my cats are about 11 pounds and 14 pounds and they definitely appreciate the extra room to get in and out. They recommend one box for each cat plus an extra, but we don't really have room for another one of these and getting a traditional ""scoop"" box would defeat the purpose of the convenience of these. But as long as their scooped daily, two boxes for two cats has worked out just fine.",cats,2
"I purchased the Omega Paw Roll 'n Clean litter box so that I might cut a few corners when it came to cleaning up after my cats. It's proven to be more of a hassle than our regular covered litter box.Pros:1. Traps odor well.2. Once rolled, scooping litter out in one shot is easy.Cons:1. Rolling and cleaning worked well only once for us--the first time. After that--and we clean the box daily--it took more banging on the sides of the box to detach the clumps off of the floor of the box toward the side and into the scooper. NOTE",cats,2
I really love this adjustable treat/food ball. I have 2 Burmese cats that get a small amount of dental diet each evening and the adjustable holes on this ball work great even for the larger sized kibbles. The ball gives the cats exercise and mental stimulation-as close to hunting prey as my indoor cats are likely to get. It is a real joy to see them so happy and engaged.,cats,2
"I bought the small one so I could use it on my cats and medium-sized dog. It works pretty well on the cats, but my dog has coarse, thick hair (Corgi), and I have a difficult time getting it through to the skin. The blades are the same on all sizes, so the size isn't the problem. It works okay, but because the blades are short and close together, I have to press hard to get it through her coat. It seems to pull and hurt her a little, so I stopped using it on her. I found a different product yesterday for her--Oster makes one called ShedZilla that has longer, wider, and safely blunted blades that easily go through even her hair, AND she seemed to enjoy it! So if your pet has this kind of hair, the FURminator might not work as well as you hoped. It is pretty good for shorter, thinner, or finer coats though.",cats,2
"Initially, this item seemed to startle my 10 month old poodle mix and distract her from barking. But I think she either got used to the sound or the sound made her more agitated, because after a week or two the barking almost seemed to get worse. We finally took the battery out and put it away. And it may be just coincidence, but the barking seems to have subsided somewhat. (We've since been putting the leash on her and making her sit and ""be quiet"" and then rewarding with a treat when she complies, after every time she starts up a round of barks at people outside the apt. So far, she's not gotten worse.)",dogs,3

These ears are SMALL...while they appear to be ears, not strips, they are ridiculously small and have no weight to them. Color me disappointed.

"I got this ball as a Christmas present for my dog, a golden retriever. It didn't make till Christmas. She grabbed it out of the box and off she went with it. I bought it after reading other reviews because this little 63 pound dog is also the ""great destroyer""! No stuffed animal is safe in her presence, well, maybe for 5 minutes. It got frustrating to find something to entertain her and I was wasting alot of money. This ball is the exception. She loves it. She grabs it by the rope (which she has not chewed!) and whips it back and forth so hard that she beats her head with it. That's the other great thing about it, the ball has ""give"" to it. It doesn't hurt her when she does that and she has found that she can also grab the ball part. Sure, it has teeth marks in it but it doesn't affect the ball. It has been sitting outside in the snow and it doesn't deflate. I finally found something that is worth the money. I tell all my dog owning friends about it, but maybe they don't have the Tazmanian She-Devil that we have. I would highly recommend this ball. I think I will get the 8"" ball for the spring.",dogs,3

"I started this collar on the lowest setting for my 28 lb. terrier and never had to change the setting. For my Catahoula (48 lbs.) it took a little more - the second setting. Both dogs come to me to have their collars put on when they go out first thing in the morinig. Then I take them off at nine so they can eat. The collars have to be set just below the chin - kind of high on the neck - for them to work properly. If they start barking during the day I only have to hold the collar where they can see it and ask them if they want me to put it on them. They don't. And they stop barking, too.",dogs,3
"THIS IS HIS FAVORITE TOY. I'm constantly replacing this toy when lost, or used, or broken. He will squeak this, he will play ball with this, and he loves carrying this around.

"Like so many other reviewers here, I would like to add my vote for this as the best water conditioner available. A little bottle will last you a long time, even if have a big tank and do lots of water changes. This 500 ml bottle is enough to treat a 55 gallon tank that gets weekly 20-30% water changes for nearly two years. If you have a 20 gallon tank or something smaller, you might do better to just get theSeachem Prime 250mlbottle. It does also come in a smaller 100ml bottle (Prime, 100 mL / 3.4 fl. oz.), but given the shipping add-on, you might want to just head to a good fish store and buy it there.Prime is great to have on hand if you are worried about ammonia spikes. Just a few drops per gallon will neutralize the ammonia very well, though you will still get high ammonia readings from your ammonia test kit because the ammonia has been converted into ammonium. Ammonium won't hurt your fish anywhere near as much as ammonia will, but you are still going want to do a water change in order to balance out the problem that caused the original ammonia spike.Get some of this. No other water conditioner is as good.",fish aquatic pets,4
"It is a bit noisy and took the cats a bit to get used to - one of them used to run away when he heard it - but now when they hear the sound of the feeder rotating they run towards it. :) Overall this works well but the programming does take quite a few steps.

"This is a wonderful, very functional gate. The only problem is if you intend to purchase it to keep a dog out from the area with the kitty litter and cat food, don't expect it to work with a dog unless it is over 40 pounds. I expected my small beagle to make it through since it only weighs about 24 pounds, but the larger beagle mixes, one of which weighs over 40 pounds also manages to get through the small gate and a very chunky sheltie mix also gets through with no problem. If they made an option with a smaller secondary opening, then it might work. If you have a large dog this might be the solution unless it is a jumper, then it might not be tall enough.",dogs,3

"My recent purchase of an Aquaclear 110 makes for my 8Th Aquaclear - I also own five 20's, a 50 and a 70. Two of the 20's are kept as spares, the rest are in daily service.The HOB aquarium filters today are far more intelligently designed than the ones I started out with back in the late 1970's.And while it's recommended that three and four stage filtration being used, the truth is that two stage filtration including mechanical and biological filtration are all that's necessary to filter your aquarium properly.The Aquaclear filters are especially nice here, because you can customize the size of your mechanical and bio filters, and use them repeatedly instead of having to spend money to replace them each month.You can also add peat or other filter media to serve the specific needs of your fish and plants.I also recommend oversizing your filters since it's all but impossible to over filter a tank. I use redundant filtration in my Aqueon 37, which includes a Fluval 305 canister filter and an Aquaclear 70.I use an Aquaclear 110 in a heavily planted and overstocked 20 gallon tank, and an AQ 50 in a 10 gallon tank, both of which do a great job on their lowest flow opening.When I want to do a quick cleaning of the tanks, I open the water flow to its full open position and the tanks water is crystal clear in no time.These are excellent filters that offer simplicity of use and reliability.",fish aquatic pets,4

He sports this basketball jersey in the warm summer months, and it's light, fresh and comfortable for him in our hot months here in New Mexico. I bought this a couple years ago and it is holding up strong! I wash his clothes frequently and the iron-on type lettering on the jersey hasn't as much as started to peel off. Most clothing with the iron-on lettering and graphics from stores have a tendency to stick together in the washer and then peel off. Not this one!! Snoop Dogg really did his research when deciding his manufacturer of his clothing line because I have bought all Snoop Dogg's Pet Clothes from his line (2 different-hoodies, 1-basketball hoodie and 1-tee shirt) and they are durable, they don't shrink, fall apart in washing or drying!! My poodle Oliver is a little guy and I purchased a size small, fit my 7 pound perfectly as all Snoop Dogg Pet Clothes do!! One small thing for dog or cat owners that have doggy doors...we have an inside doggy door in a wooden door then the same size opening in the metal mesh type screen door on the outer side, well the jersey sometimes will catch on the top his jersey. It has snagged a little from him coming in and out of the house. The snags aren't noticeable at all, and washing hasn't aggrevated the jersey to make the threading snag anymore but just thought I'd mention it!! Oliver has received SEVERAL compliments on his jersey!! THANKS SNOOP",dogs,3

"I just tried this earlier in the day, this is very effective.

Kitty likes to hop on the counter then on the top of the fridge then on top of the cabnites near the ceiling, I don't need paw prints on my counter thank you very much, much less the germs from the litter box or walking round on the floor where I prepare food. Well to test the mat I put the setting on medium and put the mat in a doorway I prefer my cat not use, she jumped two feet in the air and ran so fast I could not help but laugh, needless to say she has not used that doorway since then.

I decided that it was wearing out and bought this newer model. What a mistake! I was changing the container every 3 days instead of every 6-7 days. The rake did not get all the waste but got most of the litter so therefore the container was mostly litter and not waste. It is not made the same at all.

"I have a 55 gallon freshwater tank with 34 fish. I have a fluval 306 cannister filter with included media. I do regular 30% water changes weekly and filter cleanings weekly. My water was pretty clear from the front of the tank but looked like a brownish tint from the side (Not Tannins). There were a few times that it was absolutely crystal clear from the side view so I knew it could be clear again! I read that dissolved organic materials need to be removed from the water through water changes or filtration media. I tried to do 2-30% water changes a week and still the brownish tint from the side. I read about 2 Seachem products - 1 Liter Matrix Bio Media and 100ml Purigen Bags. I called the company to get the low down on this stuff and apperantly it is supposed to add much more bacteria to filter and also clarity to water by removing dissolved organic materials. I did a 30% water change, cleaned my filter, left old biomedia in and added the new Matrix. I got 75% of the new Matrix Bio media to fit in the cannister. I will fit the rest in when the new media starts building bacteria. I also added the 2 Purigen Bags to the cannister. I went to bed and in the morning the water was crystal clear. Its been 3 days and still crystal clear-from the front and crystal clear from the side. I am not sure if it was the Matrix or the Purigen that made my water clear but for the cost I would recommend getting both!

"I have tried every collar there is for my 2 1/2 year old Rottweiler. She has three head collars, 2 harnesses, pinch collars, choker chains and regular nylon collars. NOTHING works on her. She has been through 4 months of obedience training and my husband and I have spent hours working with her and walking her daily. We love to go hiking but, she had a bad habit of lunging at people and bikes. Once she got worked up from seeing another hiker or biker, we could not seem to calm her back down. She just became crazy in the head and hard to control. It became so bad that we had to stop hiking because she scared other people and with her size, 112 pounds, it was really taking a toll on our shoulders trying to keep her under control. She was never aggressive, not growling or biting, just lunging and hard to keep hold of. Several times, she pulled me off my feet. This collar has been a miracle for us. She is a perfect little angel now. She gets over and sits on command when a jogger or car goes by and if I sense she is going to jump, I give her the warning beep. It only took about a week of using the ""shock"" before she got it and now we almost never have to use the stimulation. The beep is all she needs now. I must admit, the price kept me from buying it sooner but, I wish I would have got it a long time ago. This is the solution for problem behavior. I highly recommend this product and it has been the only thing that has worked for her. It is so nice to have a well behaved dog. All the training she went through made a difference too. She had the knowledge, she just refused to obey until we had this collar. It is worth the price.",dogs,3

"One of my dogs is a yorkie/pomeranian cross and her fur is beautiful, but oh so difficult. She has the dreaded double-coat, but most of the undercoat and leg hair is the super fine, silky and easily knotted yorkie texture fur but the length and coarseness of pomeranian fur on the top coat. Even when I get her groomed, it only lasts about a week before we start getting tangles, even with multiple brushings per day.I washed her with Dr. Bronner's Baby Mild Castile Soap (http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Magic-Soaps-Castile/dp/B003OUI4XS) and rather than conditioner her like usual, I just rinsed her and then sprayed this on as I would a leave-in conditioner. I blew her dry with a hairdryer and comb, spritzing on more when I hit patches that didn't easily detangle.I have never seen her this soft or sleek, even when coming back from the groomer. I was VERY impressed. She smells good (the smell is not very strong, but not particularly nice--just kind of fresh) and again, she is SO SOFT. I will be interested to see how long this effect lasts, if it lasts 2+ weeks, I will be happy. Less than that and I will edit my review. But I am very happy with it right now, because thus far even when her feet and paws get wet on walks, she doesn't retangle once dry. Even though she loves to give a quick roll in grass and dirt, it seems to repell more easily--like it says.After washing her, I didn't feel like washing my short-haired chihuahua/terrier mix (who has short, glossy, but very thick fur) so I just sprayed her down dry and gave her a quick brush. It has made her significantly softer as well and she seems to be repelling dirt more, too.Conclusion",dogs,3

You won't be disappointed with this leash. It is long enough so your dog can run ahead of you but strong so she will be safe.

"I got this for a doberman pincher pup. At first she tried to take it off, by reaching around and biting the rear end of the coat to get it off. So I decided to 'train' her to wear it. I kept her REALLY occupied, chasing a frisbee NON-STOP for 15 min or so for the first few times I put it on her. I then took her right into the house, and ended the play session, removing the coat in the house. If she realizes she must wear it when playing in the cold, she does with no complaint. She got used to it very quickly, and now leaves it alone. I notice it keeps her from shivering so soon after we go out. It fits her body perfectly, and with that tall collar standing up, she looks like 'Elvis' pup. Great Value. It is very well made, and great looking.UPDATE 11/7/12 I got another pup in 2009 and she also wears this coat, but will tug at the backend of it sometimes, even at 3 yrs old now.But she leaves it on.. . I still LOVE these coats for cold non-snow weather.. I get coats that cover the stomach for deep snow... (fido fleece), but these are easy to put on and do the job of keeping the muscles just warm enough to keep them from getting injurys so easily... I just, last week, purchased 2 more of them as one coat is wearing out finally (after almost 5YEARS of heavy use), and the other has been chewed abit, it has holes in it, from the pup... I forgot to take it away after taking it off her. IT still goes on , but finally the strap under the belly gave out, on the oldest coat.(5yrs) I could sew it back on easily, but the rest of the coat got chewed up so I decided a new one is in order.",dogs,3
I was very patient with this product. I gave a month per step. Instead of the recommended 2 weeks. I have 2 cats and they caught on to peeing in the kit very quickly. But when it came to pooping they would just do that outside the box.

I spent 2 months on step 1 and then just decided the constant cleaning of poop off the ground was more work than i wanted.,cats,2
"This is my third Petmate Fountain over the last couple of years. The first two both had motors that died within a week. Since I have yet to find any fountain worth a dime, I decided to try this one again. So far, the motor hasn't died. That is the only positive, but I've only had it a few days. However, the fountain's water level gets insanely low and the water does not flow out of the reservoir unless I pick it up manually and let it drip out by holding it about an inch higher than it's normal position. Worse, nothing gets filtered by the filter because it doesn't have enough oomph in the flow to push debris back up to the filter. So the debris sits in the bottom of the bowl, deteriorating and making the water scummy. The little gate is incredibly useless. Yes, it keeps the motor cleaner. However, the whole point to having a filtered water fountain is to give your cats cleaner WATER, not a cleaner motor. What this little gate does is hold all the debris in the bowl so the cat is forced to drink debris filled water. Or actually, scummy water 1/2 inch from the bottom of the bowl, since the water level gets so low in a day or two. So, while I continue to search the world over for a decent fountain, I have resorted back to manually filling a regular bowl several times a day for my cats. At least, then, I know they actually have water available and are drinking clean water and are not forced to lick the scummy stuff from the bottom of a scummy bowl.",cats,2

It's material is long lasting and the ball doesn't make too much noise, unlike the hard plastic of the Buster Cube. I found it easy to fill with treats and a challenge for my dog to get them out. My dog is definitely a chewer but he didn't eat this toy like some of the others, but I'm not sure if I could say the same for all chewers.If I have one complaint about the toy it would be that it seems to be a little hard to clean out. I would recommend keeping this toy inside preferably, but I also think it is great for outside dogs too, especially in an area with some kind of hard flooring like concrete.

Not to mention wasting cat litter from scooping and dropping it as it went into the waste bag. My teenage boys would complain constantly of having to clean the cat litter, NOT any more. I have shown each of them how to clean the litter box and my youngest has volunteered to clean the litter.My litter seems to last longer and not end up all over the floor.

I have it in a 5 gallon rimless tank with no lid, and it holds it at a consistent 76 degrees in a room temp of only 68-69. However, I have to set the dial at 81 to get results of 76. I have had several different brand heaters in the past, and the quality of this appears to be ok, but the dial was not properly calibrated. Overall I am happy with this product, it heated quickly, and holds the temp steady.",fish aquatic pets,4
"A 7-day course of this stuff definitely got rid of the ich. The betta fish tolerated it well - if it bothered them, they didnt show it.However, I'm guessing it killed my two ottos. The warning says that scaleless fish could be susceptible to treatment - they were right.",fish aquatic pets,4

The ball I got doesn't look like the picture but more like an ugly blob of plastic with a lot of molding ridges and wrinkles. For almost $12 a simple plastic ball should be more aesthetically pleasing. My dog could care less of course. For him the texture gives a good grip for his teeth and the ball is soft enough he can deform it. A red Kong ball is a lot harder. My puppy ripped the decoration off a two-color Orbee ball but this one is one piece and he does fine with it. A adult strong chewing dog would probably rip this ball up but it works ok for us.,dogs,3
"I've tried several brands of Glucosamine. These are very chalky. My dog wouldn't eat them and after I tried crushing and mixing them in with her food, she refused to eat it. The container looks suspicious to me. The label is cheap paper and it appears like someone printed it off their home computer and pasted it to the jar. I'm going back to Phycox soft chews. They are worth the extra money.",dogs,3
"This was a complete waste of money. I'm wondering if it just doesn't work anymore or if this could be a counterfeit, but the Advantix I bought at Petsmart last year worked fine.

I'd give it 0 stars but that does not appear possible here.",dogs,3

"I would recommend the 10"" ball for dogs and the 14"" ball for horses and zoo animals.I bought the 10"" and 14"" balls. Even though I feel the 14"" ball is to big for a dog, my 90-pound pit-chow mix plays with both in different ways. These are very hard plastic balls and not the rubber like jolly balls sold by Petco. Do not try to kick the balls with your toe, or it will hurt. Use the inside of your foot or the bottom of your foot. My dog has tried his best, but could not bite it, chew it, claw it, pop it, or pick it up. He figured out he could push the big ball around the yard with his nose or push the small ball through his back legs with his front paws. The only problem is when my dog tears up the shrubs that stop his ball from rolling. I took the 10"" ball to the dog park, and a pitbull was so fixated on killing it; he managed to gouge some shallow groves in the ball where he tried to pull out the plug without success. The pit played with it for about an hour until his owner took it away from him because his mouth was bleeding form the sharp edges of the grooves he made. The owner asked me where he could get one when h saw his pit exhausted. If you take it to the dog bark, make sure you warn everyone not to kick it. They are not too heavy to pick up and throw. I am a 50 year old woman and can pick up even the 14 inch ball.If you dogs has strong jaws like a pitbull, I suggest you supervise their play time to make sure they don't cut their mouth on the grooves they make.",dogs,3
"3/2/12 update-- I ran across this old review of mine when someone was asking about Big Shrimpy beds--as an update I can say that the bed still is terrific! It does require fluffing every so often, but it's not a big deal. It washes easily and even survived a ripped off toenail incident that left blood everywhere. It is easy enough (yes some work) to take apart, wash, fluff, return to like-new status. Jackie still loves this bed (and one other type too) but this one is the champion in terms of quality and workmanship. The stuffing is made of recycled materials and (when I last checked) it is a US made product. I remain a very happy Big Shrimpy fan on my dog's behalf.One other thing that is important to note is that the bed is sold by a 'partner' vendor with Amazon. Amazon is not the primary seller so when shopping make sure you check things like pricing and shipping fees, as these may vary significantly. Also, check the vendor's feedback as well. This is advice I give for any partner seller--the vast majority are great but doing due diligence is always a good idea.The rest of the review is as it was the last time I edited.._____________________________________________________________________________________________We actually own the purple one, but otherwise it's the same as this one.Jackie is a bony greyhound and needs good cushioning and this bed delivers. It's incredibly well made, durable and nice to look at to boot. Jackie (and many other greyhounds) like to drape or prop their heads (depending on mood) and she also likes to snuggle. This bed lets her assume all her favorite resting positions.Oh, and Jackie does take her retirement seriously -- she ran over 110 races and earned her nice bed-- and sleeps or otherwise reclines about 21 hours a day. She has several resting options with her Big Shrimpy being one of her top choices. To put it another way, she likes her own bed so much I don't find dog hair on the furniture.We have not noted any quality problems, and if you are considering this bed, check out the manufacturer's website for more information. I did some communicating with them when shopping and they were friendly and helpful. I am excited to see the Big Shrimpy is for sale on Amazon now. It was not when we bought ours.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.JTG10/6/11 (in my time zone) edited to add",dogs,3
"excellent product. it works just as stated in the description, however do be careful not to apply too much pressure and avoid nicking the animal's skin. if you apply too much pressure to get into the fur you might get a small yelp. so just be careful when using it, otherwise it's great! on my first ""furmination"" of my welsh corgi, I ended up with a full bag of fur and a healthy happy dog. by the way, the instructions say that this tool is to be used ONLY for pets that shed regularly. if your dog doesn't shed, then don't use it!",cats,2
"Sofia started barfing up her food every couple of days and then it kept getting worse... about every meal. She ate so fast, a bowl would be gone in under 30 seconds. We rushed her to the vet several times thinking she had some big issue. When all the tests came back normal, we narrowed it down to how fast she ate her food, never even chewing everything that went in her mouth.This bowl has slowed her eating to about 6 minutes or so. She hasn't had a problem since. GREAT ITEM. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",cats,2

"I purchased this toy for my three month old Rott/Lab mix puppy. He seemed excited when I gave it to him and he ran into the other room to play with it. I threw the packaging away and followed him (it was less than a minute) and by the time I got to him he had six of the knots chewed off the ends of the strings and I could only find four. This would be ok for supervised play, but definitely should not be advertised as a ""teether"" as it will not stand up to a lot of chewing. The two missing knots did turn up the next day as a colorful surprise during our morning walk.",dogs,3

"The product PetAlive UTI-Free for Bladder Infections in pets is packaged in a small pill container. Inside, are very tiny pills that are smaller than ""dippin dots."" It is very difficult to hold your dog's mouth open with one hand and then grab a pinch of these idiotically small pills with your other and then toss them into their mouth. I would have preferred a pill size, because it would have been much easier to adminsister. Every time I attempted to give my dog her dose, half of them ended up on the floor or stuck to her hair around her mouth. I would not buy this product again. I ended up taking the dog to get antibiotics, because I was unable to successfully give my dog enough of this product to see if it works.",cats,2

I have a 12 pound kitty who likes the carrier although I bought it for the smaller girls. Therefore...weight seems not to be an issue with cats.. One feature that changed over the years was the opening in the top of the carrier. It is now easier to put an animal in and take out than ever before. The carrier also is a bit more sturdier than previous carriers made by this company...a great feature as it never caves in on itself as a result. All in all this is a great carrier...the cats love it and so do I.",dogs,3

"From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog. As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean. The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth. Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them. This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.",dogs,3
it worked out well and was vet recommended! it was in viable for me training the puppies! at the beginning of the puppy training you attach this leash to your puppy and just go walking without saying a thing for 40 feet and then stop and then go in a different direction. The puppy will learn quickly to quasi-follow you. we have Doberman bitches and I emphasize the word bitch they're full of spice and personality. It's sort of like breaking a horse in.

I used it on the carpet and a couple of days later, all the urine smell was gone.This has been the best urine-odor removal product I've found (and I've tried just about them all).I'm really very happy with this and have ordered more...for just in case.Anyone who is looking for a tried and true odor remover should use Stink Free.",cats,2
"I have a Welsh Corgi, otherwise known as a shedding machine. Another Corgi owner told me how well the Furminator worked on his dog, so I bought one.

My advice is to save a lot of money and time with a curry comb and slicker brush.",cats,2
We chose the 7F over the model 7 because it had a full comb of teeth. This results in a smoother cut and requires fewer passes to finish a job.

"The replacement flaps are good, but when you own 4 big dogs that are continously running in/out the outer flap gets ripped at the corners or they are pulled out from the top. The shim/roller pulls throught the slit at the top where they connect and the flap is now on the floor, half on and half off. Have to unscrew the top plate and reattach the flap. This is a poor design, I used a second scree along the side to hold the flap. Also, why can't we order just the U-shape and not the full flap. It get expensive replaceing them every six months or so.",dogs,3
"I've had a great experience with Petmate products in the past, and this feeder is no exception. I had this thing out of the packaging, display-locked, battery-loaded, and programmed within 15 minutes.My only complaint is that the construction feels a bit unsteady. The ""blades"" of the mill mechanism are made of a stiff rubber that feels prone to crumbling, the bowl does not detach for cleaning, and the storage cylinder on top merely rests atop the main body of the device. The whole thing feels like a Science Fair project adapted for sale on QVC.But it feeds my cat. Twice a day. Every day. Which means that I get woken up by *WHIRRRRRRRR CLACK CLACK CLACK* instead of cat tongue in my armpit. A fair trade for $50.",cats,2
"I bought this to keep a dog. He barked NON-stop and my wife had had enough. It is helpful. He learned immediately not to bark (overnight). However, he now whines because that doesn't seem to set off the spray. The bright side is the whine is quieter and more tolerable. Again, the collar goes on and the barking stops. I think there is a system that allows you to remote activate the spray. That might cure his whining too, just a thought.",dogs,3

I tried other products like supplements, but he refused to eat one brand and the other did nothing. This salmon oil for dogs is perfect for my dog.",dogs,3

"This is the first time that I bought a laser toy for my cat, and what a surprise...she absolutely loves it. We played with it about 2 hours the first time while I was watching TV as well - you can multi-task. She actually went stalking the room when we finished, still looking for the moving red dot. The beam is strong and reaches very far, and I can get her moving all over the place. It's very good exercise for her, yet I can be a couch potato in my favorite chair after a busy work day and keep her entertained. She is 9 months old, so I highly recommend this for a young cat. If I find I am just under the free shipping threshold, I'll buy another one to get the free shipping and give it to someone as a gift.",cats,2
It seems that Innotek has trouble supporting their products. I have purchased several after the fact replacements collars and chargers. Failure happens often and I do not seem to get Innotek to answer the warranty claims. Local stores do not carry these products and as a result the integrity of the system (in other words keeping the dogs inside the fence) fails if the dogs are continually testing and looking for ways to escape.,dogs,3

They easily hold the weight of the parrot, and provide a nice place for himto hang out. The perch also swings so it is very convenient.

"Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension works wonderfully for the removal of large roundworms (Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina) and hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria stenocephala) in dogs and puppies. I have used it for over 20 years for my own puppies and dogs.It is MUCH cheaper than the monthly treatment packs with 2 chewable tablets (with 113.5 mg pyrantel pamoate per tablet for a total of 227 mg of pyrantel pamoate per pack) marketed for dogs that will cost you anywhere from 5 to 10 dollars each. This 32 oz bottle of Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension contains 48,000 mg of pyrantel pamoate, the equivalent of about 211 of those 2 chewable tablet treatment packs.

"Our German Shep. always has issues pulling. We had bought a pinch collar but we hate using it and he still tends to pull a bit. We have tried several different techniques to stop his pulling but it only alleviates he problem momentarily and he goes back at it. We were skeptical of this collar at first but decided to give it a try. Upon purchase took us awhile to figure out how to work it and put it on him but a quick Youtube video howto gave us the insight we needed. After he got used to it its a lovely collar. He does not pull at all anymore and walks like a gentleman. When he walks to far it turns his head to the side, which annoys him and therefore he stops doing it and walks alongside me like he is supposed to. He walks like he did when he was a puppy and our teenager pulling is gone. Love the collar.",dogs,3

"This catnip is so potent my cat begs for it. We have to keep the container hidden away or she will try to pry off the lid with her teeth. After purchasing a ""bulk"" brand catnip at the local store, she turned her nose up and thought it was just terrible that we would expect her to go kitten wild over anything else.Cosmic Catnip is the one she loves and she will literally eat it out of the container by the mouthful if we let her. It is interesting that cats in nature actually eat wild catnip to aid with digestion. They recommend a tablespoon, but a teaspoon seems to be enough to make any cat a little bouncy and playful. Princess will nibble on some from the container and then we sprinkle some on the floor and she rolls around and acts like she is in kitten heaven.This is also good for toys and you can roll a toy in the catnip and your cat should be occupied for quite a while. While this herb makes cats wild, I drink a catnip tea and it seems calming.~The Rebecca Review",cats,2

"I waited about 9 months before writing this to make sure the Omega litter box still worked as well as it did the first day. It does! I still chuckle a bit every time I empty it because of:A) How quick and easy it is. We're talking about 15 seconds from the time you walk up to it to putting the waste in a bag.B) Because I wish I had gotten one years ago. The only ones I had seen were the motorized type with the rake that comes across. I never got one because I figured the rake would get quite foul, the mechanism would crap out after not too long and thought they were over priced at $90 for some of them.Whoever thought of this design is a smart feller, very simple and super effective. When you roll the unit over, the litter falls into a separate compartment with a grate over it; the waste falls over the grate into the bin. Roll it back over past level to redistribute the litter into the main tray and ka-boom, you're done, just pull out the waste tray and dump it! Every 5-7 dump outs, just add a few pounds of litter through the opening to top it up.Upkeep wise, it doesn't get nasty inside. After about 5 months, I took the two halves apart to change out the litter because there are a few little bits that will fall through the grate that never make it to the waste tray. The inside was still clean and didn't even require a full washout; filled it up with fresh litter and ready to go.The unit feels slightly flimsy at first, especially the latches that keep it together, but as long as you are carefull latching it up, they will be fine. I think the build quality is adequate and it will last a long time. If they built it doubly thick, it may have costed twice as much. Considering the convenience, I think it is a bargain.",cats,2

"I have 2 cats - one who had a lot of weight to lose and one who is the pickiest eater I've ever seen, even for a cat. (Partly due to a sensitive mouth, but if he doesn't like his food he'll literally go without eating rather than get hungry and pick at it.)I try to feed my family good natural foods and always did the same for pets too, but when we learned that our older guy - the one who looooooves to eat - HAD to lose weight quickly for medical reasons, I bought the best that I could find quickly; a big name brand made with lots of fillers and unrecognizable ingredients. I hated doing it, but all of the wonderful premium foods at our local shops had no weight control options and our vet said that in his situation we really had to feed him weight control.I don't know why I didn't think to search Amazon sooner, but I'm so glad I did! I had never come across this brand at all but was immediately drawn in by the list of ingredients - all real foods, and the first one is deboned chicken. (As in, NOT corn, chicken meal, chicken byproducts, etc.) My husband and I couldn't believe it was really a weight control formula at first because all the others we'd seen so far were filled with all kinds of awful things, but it is indeed a good weight control formula. So it satisfied the cat parent in us... but what about our picky little guy who refuses to eat just about everything?He loves it.For the first time in his life with us (since late kittenhood), his dry food dish is empty after every feeding. He's lean and active so we supplement with organic canned food for him too, but that was usually all he would eat except for maybe a couple of pieces of dry food. Blue Buffalo comes with a ""Finicky Floyd"" guarantee on the back - apparently they have a picky eater there too who they try out all of their food with. If he doesn't eat it, they don't sell it. So besides having great ingredients, it's apparently delicious to cats too. :-)I would recommend this without hesitation. Both of my little guys are waiting for each feeding and are glossy, healthy, active boys. (My 11 1/2 year old has started playing like a kitten again since he's dropped over 5 pounds!)",cats,2
"When applying a flea product to the back of your cat's head/neck you need it to stay in the general area it's applied. If it doesn't the cat will turn it's head around and lick it away. This product is so much like water that is spreads out all over and runs down the cat's back. You have to apply Sergeants Silver Flea and Tick a few drops at a time and then wait for it to dry, then apply a little more to keep it from dripping/running all over. It takes about 4 or 5 applications. My cat still licked it all over. Bad.",cats,2
"I read a lot of reviews so I knew what to expect. The legs did just fall out, but a little stretching of them before insertion was all it took to keep them in place. It does wobble a bit, but not too much and easily fixable with a little felt pad. I was very unsure of the size I needed. The 1-Quart seemed litke it was going to be too small, but I did not want a huge dish for our MIni Golden Doodle. This is perfect. She is still a puppy right now, but this dish will easily hold the two cups of food that she will be fed as an adult. I did not put the legs on for the first month that we had her because it was a bit high and she would hit her collar on the metal bowl and get scared. She is a bit larger now and no longer afraid if it makes any noise. The transition to the legs was seemless.",dogs,3
"I recently got a kitten and decided that for the first couple of months he will stay indoors, which meant that I had to buy litter for him.

Then I tried Arm & Hammer Super Scoop and it totally worked for me. It clumps very well and it's easy to clean up,it also gets rid of the odor.My kitten just loves it and so do I.",cats,2

"I saw mixed reviews on this so thought I would give it a try. Big mistake, It quit working after a week. It would no longer rotate the head back and forth. Also I could not get it apart to clean it. It did move water across my aquarium while it worked but that was a short period of time. For freshwater it might work ok but for marine aquariums forget it, it will clog up quickly.My assessment is1. Its way too heavy and it won't stay on the suction cups for long.2. It uses way too much electricity (23 watts) come on, other pumps use 1/3 the juice for the same amount of flow3. Its big and takes up much space4. Its almost impossible to clean so that eventually leads to the powerhead not rotating properly.5. The water flow rate was disappointing as well.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I have been using this product for a couple years and love it. Its best feature is its detangling power. My rescue collie/border collie used to HATE being brushed, especially her tail. But without frequent brushing she will tangle or matt. Now I spray on unicoat first, and it makes brushing *much* more comfortable for her (and easier for me!) Added with positive training, she no longer snaps at the brush and even gets excited when she sees it. Unicoat is also great for reducing static. We have forced air, and my poor dogs get shocked constantly throughout the winter. But we spray some unicoat on a brush and run it through their coat, and the shocking drastically reduces. This also helps with shedding and flyaway hair. Last, Unicoat is great for between bath touch ups- though reviews and claims that it replaces a bath surprise me. It freshens the fur, gives a nice (but fairly strong) baby powder scent, and helps to clean. It's great for when my Sheltie comes in covered in mud. It helps get the mud off of him *much* better than a wet towel alone will, and in turn keeps the floors and furniture safe. But it's also not going to return his fur to a vibrant white like a bath would- nor should I expect it to. Overall, it is a great product to use BETWEEN baths for touch ups and situational fixes. Used in combination with frequent brushing, it keeps their coat shiny, healthy, less shedding, and smelling nice. It's on my list of the greatest products every pet owner should have, up there with Kongs, no-spill bowls, and martingale collars.",cats,2

"I just got the Omega Paw RA20 and it indeed rocks! It is so easy to put together and to use. I cannot recommend it more. I just got 2 kitties after not having cats for 10 years and i bought the regular kitty litter box at first. After scooping for 2 weeks I looked into other options and after reading the reviews, ordered the Omega. What a simple concept - and it's brilliant! So easy to do. Yes it's plastic and kinda cheap feeling, and you can tell the company is making bank on it, but it WORKS amazingly well. No more scooping, sifting, smelling stinky stink. It's a little heavy to turn over, but nothing spills out or anything, and it totally works like it says it will. At first I ordered the RA15 but i thought it was too small for 2 cats, so i bumped up to this one. Do yourself the best favor and order this litter box. You find yourself telling all your friends (even if they don't have cats) about how great it is!!!",cats,2

"Do not buy this crate to train a dog! They don't work at all. Being a new dog owner I know very little about it and they say nothing about this crate being for trained dogs only. My pup ripped a hole in the front ""door"" in the first few days. I turned it around and put the hole against the wall, and now in week two yet another hole now rendering it's useless. I was only gone for an few hours, and I took him out just before i left, yet it took him no time at all.I will also echo what others say about the smell... it doesn't smell good at all, and the smell hasn't dissipated in the two weeks i've had it. I do wonder if it's good for a dog to be surrounded by that smell for hours at a time.There is no returning it because it was damaged by my dog. That's $90 in the trash. That's a real bummer.To sum it up i wouldn't buy this crate again even if my dog liked going in it. It smells really bad. And if you are trying to house train a pup don't waste your money.",dogs,3

"Purchased this for a cat that needs to stop licking himself for medical reasons. I was suspicious since the ingredients are water, baking soda, and rosemary (my cats actually like the smell of rosemary), but I wanted to try something natural.I applied the spray to the cat's fur and he promptly licked himself, paused, and then continued licking himself. I, however, got some of the liquid on my hand and later in the night touched my lips. Regretted that inadvertent action for the remainder of the night due to the lingering taste on my lips and tongue.The cat has continued to lick himself in the area of application and actually spends even more time grooming himself now.I am returning the product for ""bitter apple"", which is more effective.",dogs,3

It would not stick on the bathroom wall for too long. It keeps falling off in the middle of the shower and scares my Timneh African Grey badly. He used to love showering - dancing, fluffing his feathers, and shaking his wings under the running water. However, after 3 times of falling off this perch, he will not go into the shower any more. Now, he would scream loudly and flying frantically around the bathroom every time I take him in there.

I ordered a second citikitty toilet training system and we are starting over from square one. Both times he seems to have accidents the first time or two after I remove a ring. I am committed to the system and intend to do my best to make the cat toilet trained. Time will tell! I think the system is good, it's just a battle of wills between you and your cat.

"Update:We now have 3 cat genie's (bought the 3rd from Amazon during their one day $100 off special) before we left on vacation. They all worked great while we were on our 2 week vacation. Why 3, all our cats seem to want to go poo at the same time and hate to go in the same box. One will even pee in one then poo in another one. My sister came to the house and immediately noticed the difference in the lack of cat poo smell. I'm still amazed by the product. Hopefully, they will make a bigger version for bigger cats (one of mine misses with her butt hanging out - I use the cat matts that are washable for those accidents).We only have ours in our laundry room which I think is the best solution for location.I'm not missing the poop scooping!!!!With 4 cats (12yr,10yr,2 at 5yr), this product has saved time and smell! Patience was needed to oriented all 4 cats to using this. CatGenie customer support recommended Cat Attract and it helped immediately (order some and use for easier orientation). Cleaning it often helps with accidents and issues, we have it set for 4 times a day. Setup was a breeze. Recommend getting a web camera so you can monitor cat usage which helps determine when to set the auto timer. Some of the cons others mention are minor when you see benefits. Finding a cat sitter for 4 cats to come daily and scoop poop for vacations or long weekends is very hard so this product gives you freedom. When I told my husband about this product, he said get it - he didn't even care about the price. It pays for itself quickly when you find yourself not having to clean litter boxes daily! The noise quickly becomes unnoticable by the cats and you, again the benefits are amazing...... (Once I showed a friend the cat genie and how it works,she's now getting a cat since the litter box issue was her main reason for not having one.)",cats,2
"This is a terrible product. Poorly constructed and incredibly uncomfortable. The velcro is scratchy and my dog hates to wear it. I purchased this through an animal rescue site (not their fault I assure you) and paid considerably more than the price on Amazon. I actually have one from Big N Lots that I bought for $10 that is awesome, but not small enough for my mini weinie who weighs 11 lbs. This one from Canine is way too small & more along the lines of a stuffed dog costume instead of a real dog. Perhaps a puppy could manage to squeeze in but I doubt it.

When he jumped up on me I used the Pet Agree as directed and said ""off"" he got off, looked at me then tried to jump up again. Again I pressed the button and said ""off"". He immediately sat down and stayed as I praised him and got a treat!

"We (or rather, our cat) has had this mat for over two years. She tends to get cold readily and usually sleeps some or all of the night with us. But the rest of the night, and much of every day, she is on the mat. So we figure it must be warming her. She really seems to like it.The mat does make little crunching noises when she works it over with her paws before settling into it, but the crunching is not loud, couldn't wake anybody, and is actually sort of pleasant to hear, somehow slightly comical.It's less garish than it might appear in the photo, not bad at all. After two years, the mat is none the worse for wear.I can contrast this mat with the SnuggleSafe Heat Pad. While us humans have found that it does a good job of preheating our sheets for our feet in the winter, our cat never seemed to like it at all.UPDATE",cats,2

"I have been using the regular 1 month single application version of Frontline Plus for years with never a problem with fleas on my dog. I tried this 6 month syringe version from No More Fleas Please. I was excited to pay such a low cost for top quality flea control! Sadly, On the 4th month of use, my pet got fleas!! I get an allergic reaction to fleas so the eradication of them is very important. I do not think it was due to operator application error as I followed the instructions meticulously and applied the Frontline Plus every 28-30 days. I was very disappointed. The fleas got into our thick carpet and onto a blanket from our bed that had fallen on the floor near my pet's bed. It was awful. I ended up having to bomb the house. :( Definitely not worth the savings!!

"I remember using this MANY years ago for one of my cats who liked to chew. It worked for her, so I was hoping it would work for our new puppy. He likes to chew mainly power cords, shoes/slippers, and one corner of our area rug. I sprayed this all over everything he went to chew, and it absolutely worked...for awhile.I don't know if the scent/taste wears off quickly, but it seems like within an hour, he's back at it again, only this time the spray has no affect. I'll spray the shoe or carpet again, and he'll run off wanting nothing to do with it. If I don't pay attention though, he'll be back for it later. I've found it doesn't matter how little or much I spray. I can saturate the carpet corner, or just give it a couple sprays...it's all the same.So...while this spray definitely does work for our puppy, it seems to wear off quickly. I do have other things to do with my day besides walking around behind my dog spraying everything he shouldn't be chewing on. This would be perfect if a spray would last longer than an hour or two.",dogs,3
"These harnesses are functional and stylish. I bought one because my dog likes to jump around the car, which is pretty distracting and probably not safe. Using this also helps contain his shedding to one area of the car.The harness can be used as a seat belt or a walking harness, which makes travelling in the car a breeze. I also feel that in the event of a car accident, my dog would probably be safe since the chest area is padded with fake shearling, and wouldn't choke him like a regular collar would. The shearling is pretty soft and luxurious.My only gripe, which I'm not even sure is fixable, is that the clip still allows my 10 lb dog to twist into a tangled mess, until he can't really move around. This causes the spoiled brat to start crying, which can be annoying if we are no where near our destination. However, I still feel that the overall objective of maintaining dog safety makes this purchase well worth it.",dogs,3

It got to the point where I never put his collar on because of all the noise(and complaining). Now he can run and play as hard as he wants and there is no jingling.

"A must have for all dog-lovers! Fresh n' Clean is an instant, effective and inexpensive tool for eliminating pet odor. I worked for a dog groomer for several years and have owned many pets.

"When a dog needs eye protection, Doggles are the product to use. My Siberian husky developed eye problems and we were strongly encouraged by our vet to use sunglasses for her. After finding that the regular Doggles were simply intolerable for my dog, we tried the K9 optix variety, and have had much more success with them.The head straps work very well, keeping the glasses in place while walking and running about. My Siberian took to wearing her Doggles very quickly, and while she does not exactly enjoy them, at least she tolerates them well. We always get lots of attention when we go out and she is wearing her cool shades. People can't resist a dog with glasses!I ordered the size large silver framed style, only to find that the nose piece was much too wide, despite my dog being the correct weight on the Doggles sizing chart. Owners of breeds with slender muzzles such as shelties or greyhounds may want to be careful when buying the weight recommended size, as the nose piece might be too big, which causes the glasses to slip downward and not cover the eyes. Also, the nose piece itself was very fragile, and broke after only a few months without any replacement pieces available. If the glasses themselves were more resilient, and the sizing chart more refined, these would be the ultimate buy.",dogs,3
"I have a 75lbs Golden, who loves to be outside and go for walks and jogs. When we would walk we were only able to go for shorts spans of time because he would choke himself till he would throw up. I purchased this after trying my friends gentle leader. After trying the halter on he was a little hesitant to walk. Within mins he was comfortable and no longer pulling. We went for a long walk and he never pulled once. This thing works wonders I have used so many techniques and training for walking to no success until I got this halter. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has a dog who is a puller when you walk. Not only does it reduce the pull on you it helps the dog.",dogs,3

"I read the reviews previously posted on Amazon prior to purchasing this item. I have been an ""old school"" pooper scooper user and thought I would give this a try. It just seemed logical and for the price, it was worth a shot. I used it last night for the first time and I can not believe the difference. You will never go back to the ""old school"" 2-piece set. I would highly recommend to anyone that has to do poop patrol!",dogs,3
"I have two cats, a boy and a girl about five years old. I've been using clumping litter since I first got them as kittens. I've had cats before, but they were always girl cats and I'm finding that the male leaves things a bit stinkier. I do scoop every day, but there was still a definite odor around the litter box. I tried this brand because it was one of the less expensive automatic scoopers and the reviews seemed good. I absolutely love this product! I keep two litter boxes for the cats. I started by placing the scoopfree box next to one of the litter boxes, and stopped cleaning that one. Within a week, both cats had stopped using that box as well as the other one, which is kept on a different floor of my house. They clearly preferred the scoopfree box. If you have timid cats, the noise might be too much and scare them away, but mine are fairly adventurous and will sit in front of the box and watch it scoop. Bonus entertainment value! I have since replaced the second litter box as well.ConsWith two cats, each cartridge lasts about 15-20 days in each box, which is not quite as long as promised.It is very noisy.It costs more for the litter cartridgesProsSmell is goneI don't have to scoop!Less dustMy cats seem to track this litter less than the clay litterBe sure to get the ultra version. I did not know that there were two, and the first one I purchased was just the regular version. I had to purchase a hood separately. The ultra version comes with a hood, and also has a counter for the number of uses, and lets you change timing between use and scoop. The regular version doesn't do that, and I'm kind of annoyed that I didn't know that before purchase.",cats,2
"This product is driving me insane. I purchased it for my tree frog terrarium, which is half land and half water. After the first week of use the propeller broke and I had to order a replacement. A few months later, the propeller broke again and the motor head stopped functioning at the same time. This is the last time I am ordering replacement parts for this thing! When it is functioning it makes a huge difference compared to the submersible pump I used to have that did not filter anything, as those burned out monthly and were constantly clogged. The water is clear and clean and this filter has not clogged once. I don't recommend it for terrariums that don't have deep water, as every time the water level drops it seems to die on me - though I have no idea what a better alternative may be. I am tired of spending $9.50 to replace the broken propellers!",fish aquatic pets,4

"It takes a liitle while for the cats to figure out this is a drinking fountain instead of a toy or useless object, but once they figure it out they prefer it over the other water dishes. (As long as I keep it clean!)In time it gets some hard water stains in the bowl but I just soak it in a vinegar solution (a couple T. of vinegar and fill with water)for 20 minutes or so and that gets rid of the crust and disinfects it too. The pump on my last foundtain died and it was cheaper to get a whole new fountain than replace the pump. When I didn't have the fountain, one of my kitties got sick becasue she wasn't drinking enough water. So it helps keep your pets healthy and that is worth the investment.",cats,2

"Having read several of the reviews for the drinkwell platinum I decided to buy it. Amazon had the lowest price as well. What a difference from the original! I have been going through fountains like crazy and I finally found one that not only has a gigantic water reservoir but is so much easier to clean! It all comes apart so easy so you can really get down to the parts that accumulate the hair and sludge. I do wish it was stainless steel or ceramic though. It's better for the cats and easier to clean than plastic. Other than that it's a wonderful fountain. I bought 2. I have 3 cats and they are quite happy. The size of the unit was shocking at first, but I am happy that I don't have to fill it up all the time or buy an add on reservoir. It is a quiet unit, though I have it turned to the middle so I can listen to the slight sound of a waterfall. There's a little something from this fountain to make us all happy!",cats,2

"This is my first review, I don't normally write them and I rarely use the word miracle but this harness really works and for my dog has been nothing short of miraculous! I tried an Easy Walk harness and it helped a little but with the Sporn harness it is the difference between night and day. I have a 50+ pound, ten month old Husky, Chow Chow, German Shepherd and Mastiff mix and she really (!) pulls and she is one powerful dog, so powerful and she pulls so hard, I'm not sure why I still have a right arm; it should have been ripped from it's socket months ago. I took my dog out for her first walk with the Sporn harness today and it was amazing. It has completely stopped the pulling and from the first step. I was, for the first time ever, a real pleasure to walk my dog. I will say though, that while the collar part of the device seems very strong, the harness straps do seem a little weak; at least a lot thinner and narrower than the collar. I guess only time will tell if the harness straps are strong enough and whether or not the harness straps hold up and how long they last. But if it the harness straps ever break I will buy another one, that's how well it has worked, at least for my dog.",dogs,3

"I've had this unit since December of 2008. You could argue that it's ""lasted this long"" ... but at this price, I'd like to to last longer. Even then, there have been QUITE a few times when the unit has had the ""red blinking light of doom"" (although in the last month it literally won't work unless I nudge the bubble and then flick it on/off to get it going ... EVERY single morning and evening). Sometimes it'll stop halfway through it's rotation, so the cats cannot use it at all! Over the time I've had it, it's done that about 10 times...and has refused to work about 60 times (ballpark figure). Realistically in the end, I haven't saved THAT much time as even while I don't have to sift through a litter box every night, I still have to manually run it quite a bit, empty the litter box once or twice a week (even with one cat around - as the other is largely an outdoor cat), and clean it once a month (which is sort of a pain). Also, the clumps don't fall into the litter box evenly (it mostly empties near the back side 2x more than the front) so you have to shake it around to even it out if not take it out and reline (which is - as you can probably guess - a pain as there are no real clips to hold the bag except some cross-hatch holes that don't hold well and leave some parts of the box unprotected by the bag - and the bags they give are real thin and tear easily. I ended up getting small trash bags, folding the edges down and wrapping the bag AROUND the box edges instead...but even that is sort of flawed as there is no clips to hold the bag near the step and I can't get around it with the bag).All in all, I give this one star because it's not very convenient ... especially for the HIGH price ... and it regularly has errors for no reason at all.",cats,2

"I don't know what I would have done without Anti Icky Poo! With a name like that you know it has to be good and is it ever! We have 5 cats of which only one started out as indoor - ha ha! All rescues and/or abandoned and all neutured. HOWEVER, one is a male and if I hadn't participated in the neutering (when he was a kitten), I would swear something was left behind. He acts more like a tom and can be brutal on the girls. He is usually outdoors or in the barn at night (because of coyotes). But in the winter he hangs out inside and he & his mom (only one who can keep him in line except our border collie mix who is our enforcer!) have a downstairs room of ""their own"" so our nights are peaceful. In spite of his toughness with everyone else he is a real pussycat to me and I love him to pieces and it's a good thing. He'll go through spells (after being outside all day) and come in and piss on something. I don't mean marking - I mean emptying his copious bladder. I keep two litter boxes one upstairs and one down and am fanatic about cleaning them - so that is not the problem. In addition, he has been known to corner my sweet senior calico. No serious injuries - just scaring her into emptying her bladder - once on a shelf over a television resulting in it flowing into the tv and ruining it! Yes my husband is a SAINT (well, he did get that new tv out of it!) I won't bore you with all the behavior adjustment techniques (his & ours) we've gone through but he is getting better. Suffice to say during these trials and errors, Anti Icky Poo has been a life saver! I have taken completely saturated bedding outside, hosed it off, thrown in the wash with a cup of Anti Icky Poo, let soak for 24 hours and GOOD AS NEW. Works fabulous on hard surfaces and smells great at the same time. If you have similar problems, DO NOT HESITATE to try this! My first order was the 32oz spray but I knew it was something I had to keep on hand and ordered the gallon size. In addition to this product, I also recommend a product called Feliway. It's a synthetic facial hormone that is used the way cats mark their territory when they rub their faces on objects. It helps create a comforting and familiar environment for cats in new areas or stressful situtations. They don't potty in their comfort zone! It has really helped reeducate my bad boy and helps my senior kitty when she's stressed. Good luck!",cats,2
"This is a very good product, my cats love it! You just have to make sure you refil it every other day so it doesn't burn the motor out if it's empty. I typically take it apart too and wash it once a week too to keep it running smoothly and keep it clean. Sometimes cat hair can accumulate in the small square motor and it's good to clean that once a week too. Provides cats with fresh filtered water and they love drinking the flowing stream of water. Definitely reccomend.",cats,2

"This is a very good product... for some people. It wasn't for me because of a few reasons. First of all, the only spot to put my litter box is in a tight space, so every time I wanted to empty it I had to pull it out in order to roll it. This may not seem like a big deal but it did cause litter to scatter. Also, there's not a big enough area for the cat to do its business, so you can't go without cleaning for more than a day like you could with other boxes. But it was very easy to use, and I didn't have a problem with it being flimsy. This could be the right product for you have enough space and time to clean it.",cats,2
"I bought this out of desperation as my cat likes to have a meal between 4 and 5 am and thinks that biting my face is the way to get it. Even spraying him with water in the face would not dissuade him from this pursuit. He also is a large cat and needs to lose some weight. Given my schedule and his incessant begging, I was not doing a good job of monitoring his daily food intake. We have had this for 2 days. Initially, the noise and movement of the dish freaked him out. However, 48 hours after first use, he is no longer scared and recognizes the sound of the dish moving as a signal that his food is there for him. I've portioned his food out so he can eat several small meals a day, and this seems to take the edge off of his always wanting to eat. The directions came on a separate printed sheet, so the problem some other reviewers had with the directions getting in the way has not been an issue. I also should note that my cat, despite being very persistant in many endeavors (ie scratching and meowing for over 2 hours at a stretch at my bedroom door), has made no discernible attempt to get into the feeder to get at the other food. From reading reviews, this seems to be a problem for some, so I guess it depends on your particular pet. I am thrilled with the purchase, as, I believe, is my cat!",cats,2

Since this is my first time buying a mega-pack, I am not sure if this is an anomaly or the usual case. The shorter bags don't bother me very much, but my boyfriend has complained that it's harder to tie the bag into a knot after you've bagged the poop.If there's no large difference in price, I'd recommend buying the equivalent number of bags through the 8-spool packs than buying this mega-pack.",dogs,3

"The crate is shipped in a box with ZERO packaging to protect it from being bent and mangled in shipping, so mine was impossible to assemble (a real disappointment). The brackets/hinges are very flimsy and were bent in addition to the whole side wall and it would've been dangerous to our puppy to put her in it! Fortunately, we already have the Iris 4 wall play pen that our now 4 month old pomeranian loves, so we didn't have to run to the local pet store after this didn't work. We still want a traditional crate for her ""downstairs"" house, and since we want the Midwest Heritage Table Top to go with it, we have to buy from Midwest in order for that to work so we're going to try the Midwest ""Select"" or Midwest ""Ultimate"" that supposedly work with the table top but were more expensive models. It also was bigger than I expected, but its hard to judge from pictures anyway. The smallest table top size is for a 24"" crate, but if not, we'd go for the smaller size crate because it looks too big for even our puppy's mom at 9lbs. I think the ""ICrate"" model is the economy priced model and it may work for some people, provided your UPS guy treats it with kid gloves...",dogs,3
"When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.",dogs,3
"With two high activity Pomeranian puppies that love to eat, these treats work great to freshen their breath. Our littlest puppy can't really handle them untreated, so guess what.?.?.?.?

"It is very easy to install and my dog loves it. I love it too. She loves to ride in the car and now she can relax and look out both windows with ease. I love knowing she will be safer if I have to stop fast or, heaven forbid, I'm in an accident.",dogs,3
"Our female mastiff is 9 months old and about 90 pounds, and we bought this crate for her. It is a very nice crate -- easy to set up, no flaws in the paint or construction, easy slide out tray, and two doors (1 on the end and 1 on the side). The crate is difficult to get out of the shipping box, but I guess that is to be expected. The only reason that I rated this at 4 stars instead of 5 is because the top door latch on the side does not line up and lock without a bit of lifting and wiggling. However, it latches fine once lined up. A couple of notes for those interested:* If you have a large breed dog (mastiff, great dane, etc.) that exceeds/will exceed 90-100 pounds, go with the 48"" crate instead of the 42"". Our dog barely has enough room, and we WILL have to upgrade in just a matter of months.* If you are purchasing the Midwest Heritage table top [ASIN:B002NC7NGW Midwest Classic Collection Heritage Series Hardwood Pet Enclosure for 42-Inch Wire Crates]] to go with this crate, please note the fact that the 48"" table top fits the 42"" crate. I know that most people realize this already, but it is an easy oversight.Overall, great crate! Would highly recommend.",dogs,3
"After going through 4 of the rake-type automatic litter boxes (DON'T EVER BUY ONE) in less than two years, I decided to try the Litter Robot. I should have done it two years ago and saved myself a lot of money and frustration!To give you some specifics, we are a 5 cat (adults) household, males & females (all neutered), ranging from 6 to 15 pounds. They all took to it with very little or no trouble at all.This is a GREAT product! It requires hardly any attention, uses clumping type litter and can be left On or Off. In the On setting, it cycles approximately 7-10 minutes after the cat leaves it. If you wish to keep it in the Off setting, you can switch it On for immediate cycling or ""Flushing"". The cycling noise is fairly minimal, kind of a loud hum, but if you are a light sleeper, you can switch it off at night and then turn it on first thing in the morning for immediate ""flushing"".Although the manufacturer recommends using plastic wastebasket bags, it isn't necessary. I use the plastic bags from the grocery store, WalMart, etc., and just cut them a bit at the seams.The only complaint I have about the unit is my own fault! Since the thing works so well and any smell is pretty much undetectable, I have, on more than one occasion, forgotten to empty the collection drawer in a timely manner... Yikes!My only suggestion to improve the product would be to add another rubber grommet to secure the bag at the front of the drawer, but even without one, I am still ordering a second unit for the house.Lastly, the customer service people at Litter Robot are amazing! They immediately respond to inquiries and sincerely care about their customers.Cat Lovers!! Step away from your hand-scoop or rake type litter boxes and order a Litter Robot immediately! Once you see it in action, you'll slap yourself for not doing it sooner!",cats,2

"UPDATE:I've had the litter box for approximately six months. The motion sensor broke about a month ago so it no longer self-cleans the litter, but still works when you manually push the clean button. Still better than nothing, but I'm in the market again and probably will look for a different litter box.----------------------------------------------------This litter box works pretty well, but the estimate that it lasts between 20 - 30 days is misleading.The cartridge itself may last 20 days, but you have to empty the waste trap at least bi-weekly and when you do that you definitely are scooping, so this litter box isn't ""scoop free."" But since it does rake up the waste, I think my cat appreciates it more.My cat didn't really have any trouble adjusting to the new litter box, but I took things pretty slowly.

"My dog is about 18years old and stays outside. He has a cozy spot in the garage to sleep, but on the occasional freezing night in So.Cal, he loves to snuggle up on his heating bed next to his heater. Since he started using the bed, he seems to be walking more easily in the mornings. The heat is good for his arthritis so this was a good purchase. I especially like the thick, protected electrical cord. The only thing I would change about it would be making the cord longer.",dogs,3
"customer service was great. The item arrived in record time, in flawless condition and exactly as advertised. But it isn't really what I had hope for. The plastic frame if very light and despite the ""grippers' mounted to the bottom my 20 lb beagle still tends to shove them away from the bed when she jumps in. The Chihuahua's need often encouragement that they won't move when they use them. So that is acceptable.They are a little shorter than I had hoped; wished there had been an option to purchase a fourth step. But they certainly do serve their purpose. I am happy to have them, but would not buy them again. They were certainly worth the money I paid for them.",dogs,3
"Our dog has been keeping us up barking every other night. We tried one of the doo-dads that makes ultra sonic noise - did not work.

Great item!",dogs,3
"My cats, who hate to be brushed, actually sit still for this. It does a great job of removing loose hair.

"When I got my dog, I made the decision to feed him ""premium"" dog food. Unfortunately, this was getting to be an expensive prospect, with the cost of shipping big bags of dog food from other online sites. Having recently signed up for Amazon Prime, I decided to seek out a Prime eligible dog food on Amazon. I came across Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, and it's been a hit with my miniature dachshund. He's somewhat of a picky eater, but eats this stuff rather enthusiastically. When you factor in the free shipping with Amazon Prime, this dog food is quite affordable.No complaints from me on this one. I'll continue feeding it as long as Amazon offers it for a reasonable price with free shipping. Good stuff.",dogs,3

I have been putting the Aller G3, recommended by my vet, on all my dogs' food since about March and her redness and itching is all but gone. I do also give them a fish oil pill, like you get at walmart, once a day. The bottle is a little expensive I think, but I checked around and Amazon has the lowest price I could find.

We used to buy these in local pet supply stores. The supply stores stopped carrying them. Was happy and excited to find them on Amazon. So were our dogs!You need to watch dogs closely when they chew these and remove the bone once it is small enough for the dog to swallow it (two inches by two inches). Some of our dogs have chewed off and swallowed parts of the bone. Some have even swallowed large chunks. One had to have stomach surgery to remove the large chunk that didn't pass through. Some of our dogs just chew and spit out any chunks or pieces they chew off of the bone. Depends on the dog.,dogs,3
"I ordered this to use with my cats around Christmas time. I put my Christmas trees up in my dining room and thought this would be perfect to keep them out of my trees. I did not order an extra collar thank goodness, so at first I put the collar on the cat that gets into the most trouble with my trees. He walked up to the transmitter and laid down next to it. My son actually touched the prongs to see if it was shocking and it was working but my cat seemed to like it. He would lay next to it whenever he had the collar on. Then I put it on my other cat to see what kind of reaction he would give. He had no reaction to this device either. Maybe I have strange cats, but this really had no effect on my cats.",dogs,3

They either have one on one rope pulling battles or one of them will bring it to me and they have a ""lets jerk mom's arm out of joint"" fun. These last for quite some time .

"This is the best litter I've ever tried. I tried crystal litter, which didn't do much to diminish odor and had to be changed frequently. I used pine litter for a long time, but while it controlled odor, it tracked like crazy and the cat disliked it and would sometimes go outside the box.World's Best was a big change... right when I switched, I could tell that the cat loved it. He digs in it like crazy and never goes outside the box.And it doesn't track much. Best of all, it clumps tremendously well and you have the no-perfume, no-ammonia-odor advantages of natural litter. Since you can flush it, it's very easy. Best of all, I've found because you can scoop it, it stays clean for a whole month. Not having to change the litter frequently is worth the price all by itself.",cats,2

"This was an absolute waste of money, thank goodness it was cheap. It didn't prevent fleas when I sprayed it on the dogs before we went outside, and it didn't kill the fleas afterward. I would literally see a flea in their fur, saturate the area with the spray, and I could practically hear the flea going ""Weeee! Bath time!"" I'm pretty sure I could have come closer to getting rid of the fleas if I had just let the dogs eat a $5 bill. Doesn't sound like it would do much, you say? Exactly. Neither did this. Oh, and the smell is ridiculously gross. I'll never eat cloves again. It would have been acceptable if it had worked. But it didn't.I finally had to give in and put Frontline on the dogs, which I was hoping to avoid. I'm also using a 10% cedar oil spray, and that is helping, as we're dealing with the infestation.

Eventually it somehow got dried up oil clogged around it, and I had to pour doses from the bottle (I did keep it refrigerated.)This time around I got Bear Treats, because the Grizzly was out of stock (also, it was a tiny bit cheaper, too.) Well, I'm glad I did, because the pump was very easy to open, and it's very easy to press down! Now I don't have to worry about over-pumping the oil and wasting it or having it squirt all over the place like the Grizzly pump sometimes did. I'm glad I changed brands.As for the oil, it's great for my cats' coats, just like any other brand of salmon oil.",dogs,3
"Not a single element of this box works. The thing is huge, but the actual littler space is small, so the cat has to pee right at the edge. Then the urine gets trapped between the top of the container lid and the plastic flange the lid snaps into, so when the lid is lifted, urine runs out onto the floor. I've tried everything, even created a little duct tape flap, to prevent this and nothing helps.So not only did I spend $[...] for a useless box, but my stone tile now needs to be refinished. A matt helps protects the floor but does nothing about the nasty smell of the now concentrated puddle of cat urine. Not to mention the difficulty of cleaning the underside of the box that has now been sitting in urine, but that comes apart when you try to pick it up, splattering the contents of the container everywhere.If we had room, I'd consider the larger one, it might solve the overflow problem, except...Then there's the ""automatic"" function. The motor is so weak it cannot clear a single pee clump some of the time, and it can absolutely never clear it after the being ""asleep."" You have to use the sleep timer because the thing is so outrageously loud. But the sleep timer does not seem to work most of the time, forcing you to get up at 3am to turn the thing off before it makes the 10 attempts it is destined to fail anyway, and before it wakes your children, leaving you to scoop the ""automatic"" box manually in the morning.I threw it out and went back to a basic box. $[...].

"My dog barked once with this thing on, got a mild shock, and he didn't bark again for weeks. He is quiet at nights and doesn't even bark at our cats any more. He's been wearing it for 4 weeks and has only barked again when another dog came up to him barking and growling and again when someone came to the door late one night. Both times, the collar quited him down after 2 barks, but he did yelp very loudly after the second bark.If you don't want your dog in pain, dial down initial sensitivity of the device, that way there will be less violent shocks before a truly painful one.I took one star off due to the propietary battery. The battery did last about 3 months of continuous use.The dog doesn't even notice the collar any more and when the battery ran out and we took the collar off until the replacement battery arrived, he still wouldn't bark.

"Just to let you know- the pictured item may or may not be the ""character"" that you receive. I ordered 3 of these and none was the pictured item. Obzo (seller) response to my complaint was ""We are very sorry but this item is listed on Amazon as being 'Assorted Character 1 Each' because you will only receive 1 toy and we are not able to let the customer choose which character they would like to receive (Assorted). Certainly seems to be deceptive to show only one item and then not have that item be what you recieve. They should, at the very least, show all the various items that you might get. SO... If you don't care which character...fine. If you care...don't order from this vendor.",dogs,3

"My biggest complaint about this product is that they don't give you any guideline as to how many you should give your cat daily. I know that they can't say specifically, because it would probably depend on the issue you are trying to treat, but if they could at least say give anywhere from 10-100000 a day in general that would help out a LOT. The vet I most recently went to was the typical all about the money man who milks every person for every dime he can & quite frankly shouldn't have been working with cats in the first place (he was obviously uncomfortable handling them). When I asked him about fiber options the ONLY thing he recommended was a Science Diet food that he was getting high dollar paid for selling (they are known for pushing that brand at their office) I had to research on my own to find these treats & when I called them about possibly getting an idea of how many to feed daily of course they had no idea. All I can say about most vets these days is one word- GREED!My cat likes the treats- she will eat pretty much any treat though so this was no surprise. I don't know if they are working properly because I got them to help her go to the bathroom more often due to her anal gland issues but so far I haven't noticed if they are doing anything for her.",cats,2
"I bought one of these from Amazon 2 weeks ago, with the extra filters for half of what I would have paid retail. At first my boyfriend nixed the fountain, as it was very loud. Luckily, I remembered another reviewer had mentioned that the unit could be noisy if the water level was low. Once I filled it up almost to the rim, we could barely hear it. The cats adore it, haven't been in the sink or toilet (well, maybe once or twice!) since we bought it. I give it 4 stars only because it is rather difficult to clean. It's a great deal for a really good product.",cats,2

It doesn't take up a lot of space, scoops the poo out of the grass & weathers the outdoors, all at a very reasonable price.",dogs,3
"I was skeptical when I first ordered Axzodyl from Amazon. I wanted to save money because my cat will need this product for the rest of her life.

It was packed in an insulated beg and had two entirely frozen ice packs inside.I am very happy with the price and the service!",cats,2
"Fortunately our litter box was next to the toilet and the cat was about 9 weeks old when we started. I removed the litter box, put the city kitty on and filled it with scwheat scoop litter since I heard it was the easiest on the septic tank.I put the cat on it to let him see it and check it out as well as putting on some of the supplied catnip. The cat used it no problem immediately. Once I cut the first ring out the cat also had no problem adjusting.Upon taking out the second ring the cat used the tub as a litterbox twice but after two days got used to the larger hole. I would recommend that after the first ring give two weeks in between the subsequent rings.We are one ring shy of being done and the cat is doing fine!",cats,2

"We have a standard poodle that weighs about 90 pounds. He's a great big puppy and we have several kids that always go on walks with us. They get him all worked up and he has a hard time settling down for the walk. It's usually towards the end of the walk before he is able to be controlled on the leash (after he is worn out). The very first time I used this, he stayed right beside me. If he started to get out in front causing pull to either side, he would immediately stop and turn slightly towards me. It took him all of 30 seconds to figure this out and now even my smallest kids can walk him. This truly does work like magic. I was shocked that it worked immediately on this dog.",dogs,3

"I was so excited to get this gate as we have rescued yet another chihuahua. Our last one disappeared so we wanted something we could keep in the house for her to stay in when we leave. Also to teach potty training. The thing is our dog runs from us and goes inside and we have to pretty much pull her out, she has always been the ""shy"" dog. It is nice being able to lift the rod and open it right up. She is potty pad trained and it is so easy to lift the rod...open the gate and clean up...takes about 2 sec. The thing I do not like is that it is a bit flimsier than I would have liked. Our dog is about 4 or 5 lbs. and whenever we leave her in it she drags it around...one time dragging it onto our playroom carpet and making a mess. So, it is a nice set up but could be a bit sturdier. We have set it up into a square, using only 4 of the gates. We come home and it is in a completely different shape. It was worse when we made it bigger. Perhaps if we had room for it to be set up as pictured she would not be able to move it around, not sure.",dogs,3
"My 4-month-old border collie mix LOVES anything that makes noise. The lobster's soundbox is easy to trigger (which is a good thing, so it keeps her attention), and it only makes pleasant little bubbling noises (She also has a Mr. Bill doll, which is cute, but the ""OH NOOO!"" sure gets annoying after a while, so this one's easier to tolerate!).My pup's not too terribly destructive with her toys -- she likes to chew, but generally doesn't rip. That said, even during a tame game of fetch, the little lobster lost a claw and a leg. I try to avoid it for tug of war or fetch now, so she doesn't remove any more limbs.If they'd used plastic thread or fishing line to sew on the limbs (or, even just better stitching!), it'd be the perfect toy for a mild-mannered dog.When this one's destroyed, I'll probably get another, but reinforce the limbs with my own stitching first.",dogs,3

Of the umpteen cats I've had all my life, none have been longhairs because they're just not practical for the rural lifestyle we lead. But my latest rescue kitten grew into a longhaired beauty who requires regular brushing. Nothing I tried was significantly thinning out or shortening his multi-layered coat, and it was heartbreaking to watch him constantly trying to groom himself.Enter The FURminator. If I could sell cat hair, I'd be rich right now! Bushels of the stuff just kept coming off of him for as long as I kept combing. I could probably completely denude my hairy guy if I wanted to! I can't thank The FURminator enough for finally enabling my Puff to be as comfortable as a normal cat.",cats,2

"Small-medium sized floating pellets are well-accepted by my 4.5-inch green severum, banded leporinus, and school of Buenos Aires tetras. Great price for the package size. It's not a premium food, but provides an excellent staple for medium and medium-large surface feeders.Actually, I would prefer the tetras didn't like them so much and would eat the other foods I give them - they grab a single pellet in their mouths and carry it around until it dissolves or they lose it. There are a dozen of them, so they &#34;steal&#34; a lot of pellets from the larger fish. Even the yo-yo loach will swim to the surface to grab one and take it to the bottom.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I purchased this after using a Furminator for over a year on my 120 lb white Akbash. Akbash have coarse outer guard hairs and a dense fluffy undercoat which they shed heavily at least twice a year. I brush my dog while walking him (keeps the hair out of the house) and he doesn't mind it at all. So I brushed and brushed daily with the Furminator, but never seemed to be making much headway. A lot of hair came out, but there was just as much the next day and if I skipped a day...!I'd used different types of rakes on my GSDs in the past and knew they worked well, but I didn't think they would do much more than the Furminator on an Akbash, since the most effective ones I used had relatively shallow teeth. However this rake is fundamentally different. I used it once and all his undercoat came out effortlessly and stayed realatively intact in the rake, not flying everywhere. It was really rather shocking how much I had been missing with the Furminator. I think because of the coarse nature of the Akbash coat, the Furminator's shallow teeth just don't penetrate to the undercoat.I still use the Furminator to ""finish"" his coat after raking and for daily upkeep when his undercoat has been shed, but I bought it on sale for less than $10 and I don't think I would pay the usual $40 to $50 for one now. The Evolution Rake paired with a regular inexpensive slicker would work as well. But it probably does depend on the breed of dog and its coat.",dogs,3

"I have a one year old cat who's VERY picky about his toys. He'll usually bat at it a few times and that's the end of that! I tried squeaky toys, remote control mice, chirpy bird toys...he didn't even like Da Bird! The only things he seemed to like were cardboard boxes, rope, and crumpled paper balls. My house was starting to look like the trash can threw up because of the weird things he played with. But this? The design is simple, a multi-colored piece of felt on a stick, but he LOVES it. The instant I took it out of the package, he was at my feet and ready to play. Every time he sees it, he's all over it (I have to keep it hidden most of the time).The only complaint I had was that the stick wasn't that sturdy, and my cat has his front claws, so he would hook into it and the stick would bend dangerously. I was afraid he'd break it eventually, so I fixed it by wrapping duct tape around the handle. It ain't pretty, but Bear-cat doesn't care about the looks, and neither do I. Overall, I DEFINITELY recommend this to cat owners, especially if your kitty's picky about toys!",cats,2

It was really easy to put together and is light weight so I can move it around, as needed. As soon as I put it on the ground, my dog jumped right on it and layed down. I recently got another small dog and there is plenty of room for both of them to stretch out. It is easy to hose off, as needed. I usually put a blanket on it to make it a little softer and warmer - and yes, I do spoil them. When they are ready to come in, I just stand the bed up in the corner of my screened in porch. It doesn't take up much room and is quickly ready for the next day.Neither of my dogs are chewers so I don't know how long the cover would hold up with little teeth chomping on it.

"This product has had positive and negative reviews, and is not without its share of problems. For example, another reviewer pointed out, and I have confirmed the math on this, that the cleaning solution for this product is about $128/ gallon, but at the same time Starbucks coffee frappucinos cost about $411/ gallon, so I really don't see that as all that negative. I also think that many, if not most of the problems voiced in the reviews are all due to behavior issues with their cat(s) and their inability to properly install, operate, and maintain this appliance. This is an appliance, mind you... A cat box, yes, but an appliance indeed as well. What other type of household item plugs into both water and drainage pipes? This is by no means perfect, and as I mentioned before, issues with cat behavior can affect owners of all different cat boxes, and this expensive one is no different. My cat adopted to the CatGenie literally overnight, with no 'accidents'. I will say, however, that the 'litter granules' do get everywhere, and although not as bad as regular litter being everywhere, they still do get on the floor and require cleaning. On a positive note, they are easy to spot and clean, and are always sanitary, so I don't worry about germs or odor from them. Another granule related note",cats,2
The fence transmitter and receiver collar work just as well as the expensive ones that the pet containment companies would like to sell you. But watch out for the light guage antenna wire that comes with this kit. I've had 3 problems with the wire:- Stapling the twisted pairs to the side of my house - the flat staples cut right through the insulation and shorted the antenna loop. Took a while to track that down.- Easy to break. Above ground stretches of the wire (along a fence) have broken twice.- Apparent high impedance - the transmitter chirps intermittently because it thinks there's a break in the wire when there isn't. I suspect this is just the impedance from 1000 feet of tiny wire.I plan to buy a roll of heavier wire at the hardware store and replace the antenna entirely.Follow Up (Dec 2009),dogs,3

This is a very nice container. I love the concept but I was shocked when I opened the box and found it to be so little. I have two St Bernards so I chuckled a bit when I saw it.

"These biscuits really are light, so light that holding one in your hand is almost like holding nothing. The one in front of me is about 1.5"" by 1"" in size with irregular, curved edges and the word LITE in bas-relief atop each biscuit. If one is so inclined to break a biscuit apart, it's best to do so over a tabletop or paper towel because lots of little crumbs will fall.Perhaps I was daydreaming about potato fields that day, or anticipating some suppertime spuds, but I inadvertently picked up this box of Lite snacks instead of the customary Nutro chops or Rice and Lamb formulas. The first ingredient of the Lite recipe is wheat flour, something I try to avoid for sensitive bichon Evie's sake. Fortunately the other two pooches in the family could afford to lose a couple pounds and neither of them is bothered by wheat. If fact, Piper is enrolled in Wheat Watchers.Bella and Piper responded to the Nutro Natural Choice Lite Snacks well. Neither has complained though in the mixture of breakfast treats offered these Lites are often the last snacks eaten.FINALLY - Nutro Natural Choice LITE treats are a passable snack despite the commercial spelling of ""light."" A study of the ingredients shows it's predominantly a grain snack with lamb meal and chicken fat far down in the ingredient list. In the Chops biscuits, ground rice is the first ingredient with lamb meal coming in fourth. On the positive side, there are no by-products in there or artificial additives.I think the whole concept of a ""lite"" biscuit is kind of silly, especially for those like myself who only feed one or two of these biscuits a day to their dogs. How big a difference in calories can there be between the biscuit recipes anyway? Low calorie formulas make more sense in kibbles that serve as the main part of a dog's diet.",dogs,3

"My husband and I bought our cat this contraption for Christmas. Let's just say, it was set up on the 25th and broken on the 26th. The automated rake would stop halfway or move all the litter to the end of the box so that when it would try to move the waste into the receptacle, it would jam. The wheel on one side of the rake broke after it tried to do a once over.Also, the automated rake couldn't pick up the urine clumps. Who knows, it may have been my cat, but I thought it was meant for cats of all shapes and sizes. As for the length and width of the litter available, it seemed much too small for our 14 lb. cat and he looked cramped while doing his business.",cats,2

However, this was an awkward size becuase it is labeled as small/medium and I think it is still too big for my frenchie. Every time I cut her nails she bleeds, but that could just be because of her nails themselves (apparently they have an extremely long quick). For the price, you can't beat this clipper though.",dogs,3

"We adore our ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box - our only point of contention is buying these refills. Yes, the refills work fine. We love the whole concept of this system, the crystals are awesome at absorbing the odor, the tines never clump. However, it is pricey to buy in essence a cardboard box with some crystals in it for this much money. So we experimented and found a solution.Instead, we take their cardboard box and spray it with a regular spray lacquer like you find at any Michael's store - a few coats. That makes it waterproof. Then we buy standard crystals at a WalMart. We get a ton of uses out of it, and just wash the box itself out every few weeks. We have two cats - one an 18 pounder, so rather large. He doesn't have any issues at all with this. I'll note that he doesn't have his front claws, but our smaller cat (8 pounds or so) is fully clawed and hasn't had any issues with this either. No ""claws through the cardboard"" or anything. I imagine if you had some sort of tear-happy kitty you could reinforce the bottom with a sheet of plexiglass very easily, which would be quite washable and durable too.For us, however, that wasn't necessary. Yes we might have to buy one of these every number of months to get a fresh, clean box to start with, but other than that you can certainly ""create your own"" without having to buy their units.I'm not sure how to rate the unit then. I'll give it a 5/5 because it is an awesome idea and you should get one or two to start with. However, keep in mind that you don't need to keep buying them if you don't want to - it's just as easy to make your own once you understand how they work.",cats,2

"I bought this for my two dogs because we were having a problem with ticks. I kept finding them on their fur, and while they weren't attached the whole thing made me really nervous. My dog Yogi had been given this product before we brought him home from the shelter, and since he never had fleas it seemed like it was working well. When I received it I put it on both of my dogs--Toby & Yogi. Yogi did fine; Toby was an entirely different story. After 30-40 minutes, he was shaking, vomiting, lethargic, had accidents in the house. I was terrified! I called Merial to speak with one of their ""vet techs"" about what was happening, and they said there was no way to get the product off and there was no one there who could explain to me what to do or who to contact (emergency vet? poison control?) or what was happening. They actually told me to call back TOMORROW. I called my vet who gave me the number of an emergency vet. The emergency vet told me to scrub off the frontline with dawn dish soap and to watch him for improvement. Sure enough, an hour after getting it all scrubbed off, he was still very weak and tired but no longer vomiting or shaking. I called my vet today to let them know that he was okay. I'm not bothering with Merial. I cannot understand why they would sell a product and advertise vet techs on staff and then have absolutely no recourse or help when a negative side effect occurs. Amazon was much better to deal with for this issue. They allowed me to send the product back for a refund even though it had been opened. I'm glad that they stand by the items they sell. I'm going to stick with eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil for my dog. It works well with a flea comb, but it is more work.",dogs,3

"Needing to keep a new four legged senior adoptee and since we often are the caretakers of our Grandogs... all a little exciting in reference to house training.... I decided to purchase a gate to keep all ""kids"" on a tile floor for ease of cleaning and still have them not feeling they were out of the loop with the family. I found this unit and decided that the price was reasonable and would solve the issue. Ordered the gate and it arrive quickly. Was easy to install and has be just the ticket! Seems very durable and looks very nice. If there was any down side, it was that we did need an extension since the opening was a bit wider than the gate would span. One was available but through Target... so I ordered it, price was a bit more than I would have expected but I guess the worst issue was the extra shipping, which was definetly more than my comfort zone. I would have appreciated and it would seem only reasonable if I could have purchased the extension from the gate supplier and been able to take advantage of a combined shipping charge. Hummm, feels like collaboration to me. Oh well, the gate is a good value. I would highly recommend it, just hope you don't need the extension.",dogs,3

LOVE THESE LEASHES. I HAVE AN 80LB BULL DOG THAT NEEDS TO EXERCISE AND RUN. I PUT HER ON THIS LEASH AND LET HER RUN...USING A CLICKER TOO REIGN HER IN WHEN SHE GETS TOO FAR AHEAD. LOVE THIS LEASH. WISH THEY WOULD MAKE IT MUCH THICKER AND MORE DURABLE SO IT'D LAST 10 YEARS. THIS ONE ISN'T BAD. IT IS WORTH BUYING.,dogs,3

frontline is the only flea control i use. there is not a better product i have found that works better.,dogs,3
This works great but my dog is a little skiddish of the noise it makes when she hops on it. Also on the hardwood floors the stoppers kept coming off but we just bought little rubber ones and super glued them on. It works great now and very handy for our dog!! On carpet I can see this working even better.,dogs,3
"I have 4 outdoor cats...one brother and 3 sisters. Born late June 2011. I made them a 2 room 'condo' inside of 2 large cardboard boxes, insulated with styrofoam.I bought 2 of these thermal mats and put one in each side 2 cats per mat and they love those mats.My cats are happy which makea me happy...Seller gets 5 stars from this buyer.",cats,2
I have had this product now for 4 months and I find it worse than the traditional style. Maybe my two cats make more of a mess than others but this thing needs constant cleaning. Also with normal litter scoops you can't get to everything in the rounded corners. The steps save most litter from the floor but some still gets out and they have litter on them constantly. I don't see where this is any better than products that cost 1/2 the price.,cats,2
"Very durable material. Have use for years and still in good shape. It just got worn and faded from many washings.The 20"" diameter size is hard to find in a one inch collar-most go to around 26"" or more which results in a double layer of material which I don't like. The leash is 6 ft long which also is a foot longer than most leashes you find in the discount stores.",dogs,3

"My dog never plays with this toy. I thought she might enjoy it because I had a talking mouse toy that she loved, but I was wrong. I think the fact it's hard plastic makes it unappealing. Also, this toy talks if it is moved even slightly.",dogs,3
"I bought this when Amazon had it on sale for around $23.00, with free Prime shipping. At that price it was a steal, and I wish I'd ordered two.It sets up so quickly and easily, almost alarmingly so. I have an uber destructive dog, and I thought if it was that easy for me to set up, it would be even easier for her to wreck. So far, so good, but I think she'll break out eventually. It isn't particularly sturdy, so I went ahead and reinforced it all the way around with about 50 black nylon cable ties. Still, I think it's only a matter of time before she bends the wire door enough to squeeze out.I think the only reason she's stayed put so far is the fact that this thing is so much larger than her previous cage. It's HUGE, like I added a new room to the house kind of huge. She is a boxer mix, 70 pounds of muscle, and I could probably put two more just like her in this thing without them being crowded. If you have a Dane or some other giant breed, it could stand up comfortably and move around in this cage.So, to summarize, the cage is a great bargain at less that $30, and would be perfect for a dog that isn't constantly determined to escape. It is extremely large, and will comfortably house the largest of dogs.",dogs,3
"This is my 10th gentle leader, as I tend to give them away to people who adopt serious pullers from the shelter I volunteer at. I can't say enough about how effective and EASY these are- a dog that can pull me off my feet in seconds now barely moves my arm, and best of all, they actually understand what I'm trying to teach them! The gentle leader is ideal because it communicates dominance in the dog's own language (ie, through it's muzzle) and it's not harmful or cruel, the way choke-chains can be. When used properly (watch the video!) this teaches the dog SO quickly that it can't pull on a leash and that the walker is in charge. In every case, within a week I've had the dog back on a normal collar, only using the gentle leader from time to time to re-inforce good walking habits. I can't recommend the gentle leader enough, though I strongly suggest you watch the video if you're not familiar with training techniques.FOLLOW UP",dogs,3

"*UPDATE*We just purchased our third tire for our dogs. It continues to be one of their very favorite toys. We find that with our two dogs wrestling with this toy, it lasts for about a year. Not bad considering how aggressive my dogs are with the toy.*ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW*My dog is a big chewer and we recently put in hardwood floors. I bought this toy hoping that it would hold up to his aggressive chewing and that it would be softer on the floors than some of his hard plastic bones. He loves it and it is so cute watching him carry it around in his mouth. So far there are no signs of damage form his teeth.Our favorite game is to place one of his balls inside the tire for him to try and get out.",dogs,3

"I really like the quality, the color, and size of this pet bed. The only reason I haven't given it a five star rating is that my dogs have not taken to it as I had hoped. Neither one of them uses it consistently and one or the other will only lie on it when I coax them. After a couple of minutes they get up and lie on the bare floor. Go figure! So obviously I will not get a second one.",cats,2

"I bought this for my older cat and now have gone back to a regular plastic box. It is just too small for turn-around room, thus he urinated several times on top of the box and ramp, with urine leaking in between the space where the ramp connects.

Our Boston Terriers tends to back out of collars so a martingale collar is a necessity. The second loop for tags makes this a real winner. The first one I bought the the earth collar for our 2 year old Boston and quickly followed it with the Peace collar for our 1 year old puppy. These collars are well made and definitely not the run of the mill ones found in our local pet store yet the price is less. Easy to recommend to others.,dogs,3

I began by buying him a high quality dog chow with no wheat or corn meal added and started adding this oil to his food. Within weeks, I could see a big difference in his coat. Soft & silkly. I will continue to buy this product to keep my dog the handsome fella he knows he is.",dogs,3
"This mat has served our kitty well this winter, so much so that we are buying another for a second location. It is a hard plastic heated mat with a washable fleece cover (not soft and flexible like a heating pad). We keep it on the covered front porch where our mostly-outdoor cat spends much of her time happily surveying her territory in cozy comfort. The second one will go in the garage, her other favorite hang-out. Only once on a really cold (12degrees) night did it not work, and that's because the GFCI circuit tripped. Luckily, kitty was inside that night, and we sorted it out in the morning when I noticed she wasn't hanging out on it like usual.",cats,2
"Our dog was taking up too much room at night sleeping on our bed, so we decided to get him his own bed. The first 2 nights he refused to sleep on it but now he loves this bed!

It's soft & comfortable and I'd recommend this bed to anyone looking for a dog bed.",dogs,3
"My miniature schnauzer absolutely loves this duck. It's by far his favorite toy. He'd definitely give it 5 stars. The ""quacker"" is far more intriguing to him than a normal squeaker toy.Unfortunately, these don't last too long. He typically has them torn apart in a few weeks. He's probably been through 8-10 of these things in the past year and a half. Fortunately, eating some of the stuffing hasn't seemed to hurt him at all. The longest we've had one go was probably 2 months. Others have been ripped to shreds in days.I'd only recommend it if your dog is not a chewer and you actively monitor the condition of its toys.",dogs,3
"This is by far one of the best dog treats I've found for my pitbull mix. She will devour a large rawhide in 30 minutes of less. These treats last for hours or days. They work best when both treat discs are placed in the ball. It takes a lot more mental work for my dog to stabilize the ball and chew on the treat. (Plus I thinks its adorable to see her use her paws like hands:) I tried to make my supply of discs last longer by only putting in one at time, which backfired because it allowed her to chew through the one disc much faster. In a true testament to this product's quality, it still took her about 4-5 hours to eat just the one. Now I use both discs and just take it away from her after a couple of hours. She loves these treats.",dogs,3

"This is my second Snoozer; my other I gave away after my baby Beau died. I was not going to get another puppy, I was sure.That did not last too long; five days ago I adopted Manny. He is 8.4 pounds of busy Jack Russell and ?Just ordered another Snoozer for Manny because he loves to ride with me and there is no question it is safer for him, for me and others in the road if he has his Snoozer.I have had, over the years, several dog car seats and I feel that the Snozzer is the best, period. Is is by far the most comfortable one I have found for the puppies. Manny can lay down and sleep, hang his head over the side, stand up to look all around and hang out the window a bit all in the safety of his Snoozer.If he has an accident it is simply to remove the cover and wash on the delicate cycle of the washer. I do put a baby pad under the cover on the seat area. Then I simply remove that and put in another just in case. There is much talk about having hard sides that will not absorb any spills or oder but I do not feel that is an issue since you can prevent those issues/problems by taking a few precautions.Having soft sides makes it much easier to adjust the car seat to fit the type of drive you are on and accommodate being able to stuff a few extra things around that you need space for in the car/your vehicle. I have never found any type of smell from accidents, either food or a pee pee, that make the Snoozer a bad choice because of it's soft sides.For my money and now for Manny there is NO BETTER CAR SEAT then the SNOOZER.",dogs,3
"I love this stuff a lot more than flakes. I bought the highest rated flakes, and this, and my betta much prefers these pellets. I used to feed my first Betta these Hikari pellets, too.

"I have 2 cats that use this litter box. While it does work well in terms of turning on after the cat has left the box and moving the waste to where it's supposed to go, I find that every time I go to change cartridges urine has gotten past the ""catch"" box and is underneath it on my floor. It is beyond frustrating and I know that my cats are not peeing outside of the box. Also the metal arm that goes back and forth has rusted and it has not even been a year since I purchased it. Mechanically it works great, as far as the build and materials, I find it less than satisfactory.",cats,2
"We tried this in order to train our 5 month old pup. We had a problem with digging in yard, pulling plants and flowers out of ground and other usual typical puppy antics. What we have found is that if she gets zapped once while doing something she should not be doing, she doesn't do it again.We use the audible sound as a warning and that is usually enough and the electronic shock is not necessary. In my opinion, you only want to use the shock for truly unacceptable behavior. Over use to my mind could take the spirit out of dog.Also, would like to compliment the manufacture for having first rate telephone customer service.....open on a Saturday, the rep spoke knowledgeably and best of all spoke clear english.",dogs,3

"I bought it for my older dog who stays outside (Colorado). He weigh about 100 pounds and has problems with his back hip. Hard for him to get up sometimes and laying on this makes it easier. There is no need to worry about turning it off and on, it turns on automatically when he lies down on it and turns off when he gets up. It has made him more comfortable and I don't have to worry so much that he gets cold. He won't stay in the house, he gets too warm. He is a lab retrievor mix and his name is Lloyd, I placed the heated bed over his big soft pillow bed. High recommend this heated bed.",dogs,3
"After reading the manufacturers directions to use for 30 days to see results, we purchased about $85 of this stuff to cover a 2500 sq. ft home for 2 months. We are now going into the 6th week with NO positive results. It was like taking $85 cash and throwing it right in the garbage.",cats,2

It took me a bit of time to get them tight because I kept getting the buckle part too close to the underside of the seat. We have a 2005 Subaru Outback. It fits on the console just fine. I can put the front safety strap down around the front passenger seat if wanted for extra security, but remember to empty the console out first. Our puppy naps comfortably and can watch the road ahead if she so chooses, all securely harnessed in the seat.",dogs,3

"I bought this after realizing that my dog's ears were irritated after her routine bath. I tried a vinegar-water mix but after the first attempt to pour it in her ear, she was determined to not let try again and she kept running away. I looked up a few products online and found this to be the best option. I liked that it was natural, soothing, and seemed relatively easy to use.As soon as I received it, I tried it on my dog. She was reluctant, as she is with any other medical intervention, so I ended up squirting the bottle while she was standing. I thought it might not work but I was surprised to see ear debris coming out. I was shocked at how much debris was in her ear, but very glad that the solution was clearing it up for her. I did the squirting process twice. For the creme, I poured some onto a tissue and pushed it in my dog's ears to massage them in. Thankfully, she didn't mind this process. After I put the drying creme formula into her ear, she shook around a little more and then finally settled down. The entire process was difficult with my anxious dog but it worked very well. Afterwards, she was no longer scratching her ear as intensely after the solution treatment. Also, her ears did not smell bad nor were they red anymore!I know my dog doesn't care for this product but I love it. If you have a dog who doesn't like having things poured into their ear, this may be a little difficult, but you should try it anyway because it is so effective. Forget spending hundreds at the vet for an ear wash.So to recap...Pros:1. Natural.2. Smells good.3. Very effective.Cons:1. Could be difficult to use, depending on your dog.",cats,2
"I bought this litterbox not expecting much, and it works well. I never expected the box to be a miracle poop scooping machine, nor did I think that it would totally get rid of me having to scoop once in awhile. I think it works wonderful for the two cats I have, and it has lessoned the amount that I do have to scoop. It still needs cleaning just like anyother piece of equipment. As long as it is not overloaded with litter it works wonderful. Just don't expect a miracle poop scooping machine that is going to make your scooper obsolete.",cats,2

"12 years ago, I bought this ball for my six month old pit bull pup after he had chewed through 5 basketballs in 1 week. It has been his favorite toy since. Over the last 12 years, our family has gone to great leangths to keep this ball. Our dog has become a fabulous soccer player, can retrieve this ball on command, and sometimes loves it more than food. Thanks to the activity he gets playing with it, he is as healthy at 12 years as he was at 6 months. Yesterday, in the midst of a midwestern snow storm, the ball cracked ever so slightly. After listening to him whine about it for the last 12 hours, we bought a new one first thing this morning.

"I have two, energetic, Standard poodles, an 8 month old male and a recently rescued (and untrained) 18 month-old female. I think I've tried every ""no-pull"" harness on the market. Either they didn't work or my male dog would chew through the straps on the front while riding in the car. Last week I purchased two, Sporn Pull-Stop harnesses, and the change was amazing. Yes, the dogs still pull, but the pull only about 25% as hard as before. I like the way this harness exerts pressure under their legs when the dogs try to pull. It doesn't choke the dogs or make then cough as a noose around the neck or pressure on the chest does. The straps that tighten under the legs are padded, so the straps don't injure the dog. Also, this harness system is PERFECT for walking a pair of dogs together. You can clip the dogs together by clipping your leash (or two leashes if you prefer) to the two rings on the top of the two leads that extends out from the top of the two harnesses. This clips the dogs together with about 3 to 4 feet of lead between them. This forces the dogs to walk together and causes the dogs to pull against each other instead of against you. It only took my dogs a few minutes to figure out that pulling away from me/each other was futile and that walking side-by-side was the path of least resistance. Now I have them under control enough that I can begin training them not to pull at all. The one thing that needs a ""fix"" about this harness is that there is always a lead or strap hanging down from the top. I'd like to have a way to clip it up, so that I don't have to remove the harnesses, when I take the leash(es) off the dogs at the dog park.",dogs,3

"These are so much better than our last nail clippers. They are really sharp and seem like they're going to last forever. I only have one complaint--the red handle grips slide off rather easily. When trimming my dogs nails I kept having to stop and re-adjust the grips. This was annoying since my dog already makes the situation difficult by wiggling and jerking her feet away. So while holding her, holding her paws, and watching to make sure I didn't cut too far down, I was also having to re-adjust the grips. By the end of it I was ready to scream! But, this problem can be easily fixed by just taking the grips off or gluing them on (which never occured to me until after we were done nail trimming! *face palm* >.&lt;) Just make sure you solve the problem before you start and you can avoid the frustration completely!",dogs,3

The litter is at least 98% clean if it is done right. I LOVE IT!!!!The price is really unbeatable here.

On humid days I would still smell urine. I purchased urine off in the gallon size, used a black light and literally poured it on to my carpet. I covered the offensive areas with plastic. I admit I used alot of the product. It took almost a week to dry. The odor was dramatically reduced. I choose to reapply again to be sure I had all of the odor eliminated. Again, I used alot of product, used plastic and it took about a week to dry. Now, the urine odor is completely gone! Even on the humid days! Kids-n-pets does work but I think urine off works better. (I also prefer the urine off smell, it's more like fabric softener) If you have a tough stain, urine off is worth the money. It will save your carpet!",cats,2

"I have a one year old english mastiff who is over 100 lbs and crazy strong. I had previously purchased the Easy Walk front hook harness but was having issues with it not staying up in the front (so she'd trip over it or wiggle out of it), and with it rubbing her legs raw (armpit area). Not sure if that is an issue with the harness or if I just never got it adjusted correctly but I just couldn't seem to get it to work. I decided to give the gentle leader a try and it's working GREAT! I'm pretty petite but I have total control of her with this harness. It takes some getting used to on her part....she seemed a little annoyed by it at first and would paw at it trying to get it off...but we keep practicing with it and that is getting less and less. The only down side is that people unfamiliar with the gentle leader think it's a muzzle...which makes them assume your dog is dangerous. That couldn't be farther from the truth with Tora, actually the reason she pulls is because she wants to run up and meet everyone we see. But it looks that way so it can cause people to avoid you.",dogs,3
"With a biweekly cleaning, this fountain lasted over 3 years for my two cats. My one cat is finicky and only likes drinking from the sink or the bathtub. When I bought this, she absolutly loved it and let it run all over head. I recently purchased a new one because the old one started to have a slimy build-up in the battery area. This could be from the water or maybe just build-up over time. The brushes that are sold separately are helpful with the cleaning process and it's important to take apart the black motor to clean out too. Living in a warm climate, this has been a peace of mind to have clean cool running water for my pets while I'm at work all day long.",cats,2

"We have a 7-lb. chihuahua who loves to burrow in her bed. We were lucky to find two Petmate beds in a local pet store over the last several years but couldn't find another until we found these on the web. We ordered two of the navy blue ones to replace our other well worn ones. They are made almost identical to our old ones, except that the lining is a little less sturdy (our chihuahua likes to dig into her bed) so the lining is already losing a little body.Other than that, the beds are great. After I remove the stuffing (which is accessible via a zipper) I clean the beds in cold water wash and dry in low heat (although the directions say to line dry) every time I bathe our dog. I have not had any problems with shrinkage caring for them this way or this often.Even though we live in Texas, our winters can get cold enough to send our little chihuahua deep into her bed at night. I don't know how we could get along without these beds. Before I found these beds on the web, I was getting ready to make my own beds using the old ones as a template. Luckily, I found these beds at a great price. They are well worth it.",dogs,3

We have rawhide twists, nylabones, squeaky toys, balls, and this is his always ""go-to"" favorite toy.We bought it because it was the least expensive dog stuffed animal at the local pet shop (because our 7 y.o. insisted he needed a stuffy) and we've been amazed by his love of it. Interestingly, our sitter says she has the same platypus for her dog and he loves it too. What's up with the love for this odd stuffed dog toy?Highly recommended.",dogs,3

"It is rickity and at this price, expensive. (I purchased ours at a national discount chain for about a third the price.)That said, my kitty LOVES it. He is huge and the thing rattles and shakes when he takes a running leap at it. Still, it has now held up for several years and he has ""broken in"" the carpeting, which makes him even happier. He spends much of his day on it, looking out the window from the top ledge or just generally going whack-a-doodle, spinning round and round the post on his side. Even though the ledges are small, he nonetheless is quite happy to sleep on them. His sister does not spend time on it, but it is HIS territory, so that's normal.I particularly like that it has a small footprint and yet, it's floor to ceiling. Frankly, for us, it was money well spent.",cats,2
"Our two-year-old female Golden Retriever was diagnosed a year ago with severe outdoor allergies. The vet prescribed two Benadryl tablets in the morning and two at night. I happened upon the Blue Dog Bakery Soft Peanut Butter Dog Treats at a local grocer. I break one in half and insert one pill in each half each morning and night. She LOVES them and gobbles her medicine right down! Yes, they will fall apart sometimes but they're pliable and can be shaped around the pill. When I say ""Time for your medicine,"" she comes right over as I insert the pills, all the while making gutteral anticipation noises like a person makes when their ""mouth waters"" at an aroma! The grocery quit carrying them and, after a call to the Blue Dog people in Seattle, they suggested that I try Amazon. What a relief that they carried them! I go through a box every two weeks and I saw NO OTHER items at any grocery that could take the place of these. If your dog is on medication and is a larger breed, these treats are a winner! (A finicky, smaller breed dog that chews a lot before swallowing may spit the pill out---It will have to be tested on a dog-to-dog basis.)",dogs,3
"I was so impressed when I opened the package and saw the quality of this rain coat. It's made of a heavy vinyl, not some flimsy plastic that would tear after a couple of uses.

With these beds, I can throw the whole thing in the machine. I no longer have to be refills for the stuffing.The dogs took to these immediately. No, there is not a lot of fluffy padding on the bed, but they don't seem to mind. I also sometimes add a small, washable throw for more softness.I am so glad to have found these, and so are my pups.",dogs,3

"I put Frontline on my bichons in September, and noticed that they still were getting flea dirt. I applied again in October before I left for a two week vacation. When I returned home, the dogs, who were being cared for in my home by my neighbor, were so infested with fleas, they had begun having a horrible allergic reaction to them. They completely ripped the hair off their tails and left a bloody, scabbing mess. Their hind ends were also a bloody matted mess. After a prescription flea treatment, antibiotics, steroids, and the ""cone of shame"", they are finally on the road to recovery. But no thanks to Frontline. It is useless. You might as well treat your dogs with water. And I just purchased a brand new, unopened package of Frontline from Amazon. When I looked into returning, I discovered that I cannot return the product because Amazon considers it a hazardous material. Huh? VERY DISAPPOINTED in Frontline AND Amazon.

"I read many reviews about this product and most were sold on the effectiveness of the collar. Let me say, it works great.We have two nuisance barkers in our back yard. One is a Border Collie mix and she loves to bark at sounds. She will run from one side of the house to the other barking. Our old senile Golden retriever will pick a part of the house to bark. Sometimes it seems as if she sees something no one else does and stands there barking at the house.Our neighbors who also have dogs, have stopped talking to us. Once our neighbor came over to complain because our dogs started barking at 3 am in the morning.The dogs now wear the collars If we let them out at night or early in the morning or if we are not home. We can no go somewhere and be confident they will be silent.The humane aspect needs to be mentioned. I have four shock collars and they have been troublesome. One collar burnt a hole in the neck of my Golden retriever and other shock collar just scares the Border mix into hiding all day. We are done with shock collars.",dogs,3

"My dog, Ava, is admittedly still in the &#34;puppy&#34; phase...But Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats (Roasted Chicken Recipe) have definitely and fairly quickly train her to be more submissive and to behaved in a more disciplined way than she might decide to if left to her own devices. At about 1.5 years old, with what seems to be another [sigh] 6-9 months of disciplining to go B4 she really &#34;gets&#34; it, she's a 20 lb. terrier-schnauzer mix.Active, willful and prone to talking back/barking in that piercing way that makes your ears want to bleed, she runs straight into hiding under the bed the moment I get ready to take a shower - knowing I'll soon go out and will crate her beforehand. She's agile, curious and nibbly enough for me to not be able to confidently leave her out loose when I'm not here (whihc isn't often, since I work from home).I had a trainer over a few weeks ago. She brought these with her and Ava was in heaven. Now, I have to confess that she gave her a more liberal amount (for not even doing anything) than I ever would - but, she did have Ava's attention and the incident proved (to me) that w/the right motivation Ava's less-than-desirable behaviors could be curbed.Since then, I've picked up my own bag of Zuke's treats and have made them a reward for Ava getting &#34;in her house&#34; (crate) on command. I'll definitely buy more, on a regular basis, and plan to use them to teach my dog the other things I'd like her to learn more of.

"This feeder was great at first. However, I have had this for approximately 9 months, and after about 6, one of my smart kitties figured out how to get her claws inside of the feeder, and get it to move, so she started sneaking extra meals. Upon trying to keep her from doing this (by putting gorilla tape over the edge so that she couldn't sneak her nails in between the tray and the lid), the tray occasionally became stuck and the motor died. This only happened on one of the trays (I have 2). So, if you have a smart cat, I wouldn't recommend this item.",cats,2
"This dog door is a good solution to the issue of letting your dogs in and out through a glass door. The dog entrance/exit panel works fine and the door fits conveniently against the side of the house. However, it is only single-pane glass, and the sealing hardware that ships with it is not of good quality, so expect to make a trip or two to the hardware store if you live in a very cold climate and don't want your house leaking heat like a sieve in the winter. The single-pane glass also gets very cold and collects condensation. The installation instructions are acceptable but not great, and I also had to buy better screws than provided to get the door installed. If you want this panel to be secure (i.e. you want to be able to lock the door) you will need to drill *at least* four screw holes into the frame of your sliding glass door, to attach the pet panel.

"You're supposed to be able to use this box without liner bags. If you do that, cat pee and litter clump together on the bottom of the box and smells it up horribly. There are no bags that I have found that are big enough to fit this litter box, so we end up stretching a ""jumbo"" liner which causes rips and holes and the litter ends up going underneath the bag after you flip it to empty the dirt.

The panels fit so tightly that it was extremely difficult to hook the front and back panels to the top panel. I did finally get it assembled but the edges of the panels didn't really fit together quite right, and it would have been really hard to fold it up and reassemble it. The reason I purchased a wire collapsible crate is because I wanted to be able to fold it up to put it away or move it easily.

"My boyfriend and I purchased a Four Paws Deluxe Crate two years ago when we brought home our black Labrador, Mal. Ever since then it has lasted us through his potty training, nights he would whimper and whine, some attempted escapes, and travelling from AZ to PA. We absolutely love this crate! The only show of wear and tear after two years is a small crack in the bottom pan, but it barely passes the raised lip, so functionality isn't compromised one bit. Mal was about thirty pounds when we brought him home, and now he's a whopping 89, and he has more than enough room to stretch out, stand, and lay comfortably-- even though he prefers to curl up in a tight little ball all the way in the back!The latches on the crate itself are secure, and easy enough for my boyfriend's 5 year old niece to open and close when she's helping out with ""Her best friend Mal."" The entire crate is also easy to clean as well, just take it out to the yard and hose it down! Easy to assemble, and light enough for me to move on my own (and trust me, that's saying something).So naturally now that I'm bringing home a German Shepherd pup, Four Paws is our first choice for our new family members special space. No doubts about quality here, and with buying on Amazon I'm saving quite a bit on the price itself AND shipping. I definitely would recommend these crates to everyone who needs a sturdy crate for their large dogs.",dogs,3

"After researching this product and talking to neighbors that own this system,I purchased it for our strong-willed puppy. This is the best invention EVER for pet containment. We live in a VERY mountainous area with a sloping lawn and woods. Initially I was concerned about some of the reviews regarding hilly regions-We have had no problems with this issue. Training the dog with the flags and the warning tone was a little difficult because the tone is very quiet (especially with leaves crunching, the dog panting and the wind blowing...). We tried to train the dog per the instructions, but he just wasn't connecting the tone to the boundaries. Finally, after 5 days of pretty much playing near the flags, we decided to unleash the hound and let him learn by trial and error. It took one quick ""ZAP!"" and he immediately learned his boundaries.It broke my heart to see our dog jump off all 4 paws with the initial shock, so of course I had to try it on myself to see if I was being inhumane (or to see if my dog is a drama-queen). Turns out the shock snaps you to attention, but it feels more like a static shock-Not painful and not long-lasting. We did notice that if the collar is near the refrigerator, it starts beeping and will shock...so I would suggest taking the collar off immediately upon re-entering the house and turning the unit off.If I could improve this product, I would do two things",dogs,3
"I bought this training collar to train a hard-headed German Shepherd puppy, but the collar does not trigger every time I press the button on the remote.For maximum effectiveness I would expect 100 percent reliability and I would rate this one at 60-75 percent reliable. I would not recomment it to the serious dog trainer.It does not seem to be the battery hog as others have indicated, but the inconsistencies noted in its failure to function every time lead me to give it a low rating for quality, performance and reliability.",dogs,3

I used it on Moe, my wife's older, tubby and cantankerous cat... who has completely given up bathing in his old age. The brush performed much better with Moe and he spent considerable time making out with the brush by rubbing his cheeks on it.Overall not a bad brush, but not the best for short and medium hair cats for any kind of real shedding/hair removal.",cats,2

Upon purchasing and after a few cuts with some scissors the sponge filter works fine. If anyone knows where to find a gauge that would work I would greatly appreciate any info.

"As anyone who lives with a cat will attest, one of the less appealing aspects of feline ownership is the daily cleaning of the litter box. So, when I first saw the LitterMaid advertised, I thought for sure that I had found my miracle product. A litter box that cleans up after itself? What could be more perfect? Suffice it to say I was extremely excited to receive one as a gift.To its credit, when the LitterMaid is working properly, it provides the convenience and lack of hassle as promised by its ads. Unfortunately, it rarely works properly.I could live with the fact the LitterMaid is extremely loud when in use (it is a motorized piece of equipment so expecting it to be silent is kind of silly). I could even live with the fact that the unit is so big that I couldn't just stick it into a corner in the bathroom and had to instead put it in an inconvenient location (my bedroom). I could almost live with the fact that the replacement waste receptacles for the LitterMaid are incredibly overpriced for what is essentially just some cheap plastic. What I couldn't live with is the fact that the LitterMaid malfunctions more often that it works.There are indicator lines in the litter tray of the machine that are supposedly to let you know the maximum and minimum levels of litter to put in the LitterMaid for it to work effectively. Boy, was this a joke. I found that far too often, even when the litter level was well below the maximum line, the LitterMaid would jam when trying to rake up the cat waste. When this happens the machine will attempt 5 more times to rake up the litter (listening to the motor as the LitterMaid makes these 5 attempts at 3 in the morning is so much fun) and then a red light will start flashing, indicating that the machine has malfunctioned and it stops working altogether until you manually fix the problem.I found that the only way to prevent the LitterMaid from jamming so often was by keeping such an incredibly small amount of litter in the tray that more cat waste would end up stuck to the bottom of the tray than cleaned up by the machine. Without getting too graphic, the resulting odors were far worse than anything I've experienced with a plain old litter box. This isn't even getting into the fact that cat waste frequently gets stuck within the teeth of the cleaning rake. Again, I'll spare you the details, except to say that there are few activities in life more disgusting than cleaning the LitterMaid rake. It would make for a great ""Fear Factor"" challenge.I ultimately came to the realization that I was spending more time dealing with my LitterMaid than I ever did with a manual litter box. So I went back to manual. If the manufacturer ever improves this product to the point where it actually works the majority of the time, I would be more than willing to try this product again.",cats,2

I don't know how or why it is so tough, but so far the 2 balls i purchased have lasted 5 months. Past purchases - about 5 days! It is heavy and has a thick feel, but it floats. My shepherd mix plays in the pool with it, and it's the right size for him. Not too small. But my beagle can also carry it around, thanks to the grooved shape. Beagle loves to chew, and is surprisingly destructive for his size, but so far no problem with this ball. We like it! Worth the price.",dogs,3

"Bought this as a way of communicating with my cat who recently went deaf. Turns out he also loves to play with it (the laser light)! I use the laser light when I need to catch his attention when he's far away and not looking in my direction, and it works great for that. I also sometimes need the flashlight if I need to catch his attention using the laser light but don't know exactly where he is in a dark room--very handy to have the flashlight right there at hand at those times! Even happier with this purchase than I had expected to be!",cats,2

"I love this litterbox. Just roll it over, roll it back, then empty the drawer - way easy! It is made of a type of plastic that the clumps do NOT stick to. I completely empty it every four weeks and wash the whole thing; it comes clean very easily. The cats took to it right away and seem to prefer it to the open box, modest, I guess!",cats,2
"I had originally given a rave review of this product, because it seemed so fabulous after I first bought it. It is very thick and soft and comfortable, and I was excited for my dog to have such a nice bed. But after two washings, the zipper came off the cover! Try as I might, there's no fixing it (unless I want to fork out to take it to a zipper repair shop). Also, you can't imagine how difficult it is to put the cover back onto the foam cushion after removing it. It takes two people a world of effort to get it back on (the cover really grips hard to the foam, so it's really hard to move them past one another). I had chosen this bed because I wanted to be able to wash the cover every couple weeks, to keep my dog's bed clean, but it's just too exhausting to deal with. I really wish I hadn't spent all the money to buy this bed, because now I'm going to have to buy a different one.",dogs,3
"I was really skeptical about this product but also becoming desperate. I was trying to integrate a (spayed) female rescue kitten in with my male and older female (all neutered and spayed) cats. My older female and the kitten were acting out, ruining all my rugs, peeing on floors, etc. I plugged in the diffusers and, to my surprise, noticed an almost immediate difference. The cats were definitely calmer. It did take a few weeks for all the unacceptable behavior to stop but the worst of it stopped almost immediately. I also purchased a can of the spray to keep the behavior from spreading to my couches and carpeting and to spray directly on the areas they fouled earlier but I stopped using that after a couple of weeks. The diffusers are done and I did not need to order a refill for this purpose. I wish I had known about Feliway when I moved the kitties cross country. Although they did not misbehave, I know it would have calmed them and helped them through the stress of the relocation. I will order refills in the future if needed.",cats,2
"I bought 2 of these 8oz bowls to place in my 3-tier wire kitty condo, and they work great. Most of the pet bowls for cages require that you hook them to the horizontal wire on the cage instead of the vertical wires, and that limits where in the cage you can place the bowls. These are vertical attachment and work great for my older cat who needs the bowls placed up higher so she can easily reach them. The bowls stay in place while she is eating/drinking and are easily removable for cleaning or refilling. But if you have an aggressive eater it would be easy for them to knock the bowls up and off the ring if they were so inclined. For my purposes however, these are the perfect size bowl for a 13 year old 6 pound toothless declawed cat.",dogs,3

"I started buying these about a year and half ago from my vet when I got my first dog Lucy. Lucy is a pitbull that my fiancee and I adopted from a shelter. When I got her, she was petrified of water and hated taking baths in the bathtub. I tried giving her other treats to help calm her down but she was so upset during the bath she wouldn't eat them. My vets give these treats during exams so I decided to try them out. The next time I gave Lucy a bath I tossed a Lean Treat into the empty tub before I started to run the water, she jumped into the tub without hesitation. Baths are no problem anymore.I also have a french bulldog, Henry that is about a year now. He will do anything for a lean treat. These treats are amazing. The last time I bought them, I bought a box of ten for around $20 plus tax. They lasted a long time. I'm glad I found these on amazon!If you haven't tried lean treats yeat, please do! They are a nutritious and healthy way to treat you dogs!",dogs,3
The scat mat is fantastic!!! I bought this to keep the cats of my new convertible. They loved to climb on top and perch themselves on the canvas top. We tried spraying them with water--it only worked when we could catch them. This mat is worth the money. I placed it on the hood of the car. I have not seen them on the car since then. I highly recommend the scat mat.,dogs,3

So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing - to some extent - damage and pain for them. They love these. My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too. I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before. The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat. I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite. I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the ""bad dog food"" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.",dogs,3

I love this thing! I have neighbors with an aggressive alpha pit bull. Every time I'd go out into my back yard it would come running and slam into the wooden fence and try to fight with my dog through the fence. Within 3 days I had the neighbors dog and mine trained to stop rushing the fence. You must use it as part of the training. Just pointing it at a dog doesn't do the trick; you have to back it up with a verbal command. It does indeed work on cats too! I love it!,dogs,3

"The 8 oz cup is perfect for my tiny 13 pounds Sheltie & her 20"" crate. If you have a bigger dog or larger crate, you will probably need a bigger bowl. It is attached to the door of my dog's wired crate in my bedroom. If she is not in the crate, I leave the crate door open, so she has access to it at all times. And of course it's great for when she is in the crate.I've had it attached to her crate door for almost a year without any issues. I clean the bowl every night and it still looks great.",dogs,3

"This product worked spectacularly well in my house with 6 cats in 2400 sq feet. With two males (neutered) and four females (not spaded) we have had constant problems over the past three years with cats spraying areas to establish territoriality.We have 10 litter boxes scattered about with 3 or 4 different types of litter (more than the n+1 rule), but this hasn't eliminated the problem. I've tried isolating cats with their own litter box, and although this helps it also didn't solve the problem.About three weeks ago we installed 6 diffusers throughout the house -- particularly in areas where the cats constantly soiled. The result was almost immediate. They stopped urinating outside of the litter boxes. In only one instance has a cat urinated, and that was in a room we normally have as a cat free zone.The problems caused by having the second male cat hasn't disappeared. He is socially immature and tends to attack the other cats, but the stress levels for the cats have gone down.I wish we had known about this product sooner. Other than its cost, which is a problem, Felliway does what it claims and I will be using it from now on and am an enthusiastic endorser.",cats,2

This company had a great price, I just wish it qualified for the free s/h!.",cats,2

"I have a 75 lb. pitbull/boxer mix, which means she loves to chew and chew HARD. My roommate and I usually make bets on how long a toy will last, which is generally between 10 minutes and 10 days. Most toys for ""aggressive"" chewers last a few days at best. So far, this toy has lasted 2 weeks and is going strong. It doesn't have any chunks or pieces bitten out of it. It barely even has any marks on it. It's rubbery, so I don't need to worry about it hurting her teeth. At first, I thought she might not be interested in it given that it doesn't have any squeakers, but she loved it from the moment we gave it to her. In my opinion, this toy was well worth the price, and I'd recommend it to anyone with a dog who is an ""aggressive"" chewer.",dogs,3
"We have had our cat washroom for nearly 2 years now. We bought it when we moved into the new house. I really didn't want the litter box in my kitchen/dining area, and was tired of stepping on scattered litter whenever I got out of the shower. We had to modify it a small bit as the usual litter box with cover doesn't quite fit. No worries - we just attached a small hook to the door with the eyelet on the frame and it works perfectly! We line the floor of the washroom with a piddle pad so that any litter, etc., that may scatter when our cat is in there is easy to clear out. Recently we were gone on vacation for nearly 2 weeks - when we returned we were happily surprised to find no odor smell. Ours is set on the lino entrance to the living room - and unless you knew what it was, you would have no clue that was for the cat. I have family photos and such on the top shelf and it looks like it was meant to be there. I would by another if this one ever finally fell apart, although I don't see that happening for some time to come.",cats,2
"The toy is small, and the squeak died almost immediately. I bought it because I liked the idea of replacing the squeek. BUT, replacing the squeak was VERY difficult. All in all, I am very disappointed in it and wouldn't recommend it or the other toys like this to others. I bought a couple of these Kong toys with the same result. The dog likes them, but no more than any other squeak toy.",dogs,3
"I bought this collar at the advice of friends who were against the electric bark collar. They had good luck with it, and the reviews all looked reasonably positive.It hasn't worked right once. Not even close. We adjusted the collar as the instructions said and everything.The collar arrived and I put it on our puppy hoping to stop the crazy barking she would do when we put her in her crate (for crate training). My daughter and husband were watching as it didn't spray at all when she was barking her little head off, but once she stopped it shot her right in the face. That of course set her off into another barking fit. From there it sprayed intermitently; but mostly when she wasn't barking. They vehemently protested the collars use and I didn't believe them. We removed the collar.The next day I watch for myself. Same experience. The sensor just didn't work as advertised. She was getting sprayed just sitting still in her crate and that would cause her to freak out and bark.I sincerely wish I could return this. It was a complete waste of the money I spent.",dogs,3
"I bought this and absolutely loved it at first. However, within a month one of the clips broke and when I rolled the box I had litter all over. I contacted the Omega Paw people and was promised replacement clips. However, they never sent me any clips. I made numerous attempts to contact them, but I get nothing in response. I tried taping the area together which helped holding the top when rolling. But now I have another broken clip. I don't know why the clips are breaking as I roll it easily.The customer service for OMEGA PAW stinks.I wouldn't recommend spending the money for this box, strickly because of the customer service and a definite clip problem.",cats,2
"Our young beagle loves to chew. If not a bully stick, then the carpet, baseboards, cabinets, toys, and even the walls are all free game. We have tried several different brands of bully sticks from all sorts of pet stores with varied success. Suzy definitely prefers the smelly ones over the less-smelly organic ones. These are pretty ripe - on par with Red Barn bully sticks.The price per stick on these is the best I've found. The same size Red Barn runs $6.99 at our local PetCo. Suzy goes through these so fast (a 12 in. lasts about two evenings since she has so many other things on her agenda - like begging), that they completely blew our pet budget.One downer on buying these things in bulk on the net is that I can't do quality control on the sticks included. Some of the sticks in my shipment were really skinny - definitely not medium-large as advertised. All in all, Suzy seems to like them and we are happy with the price and ease of getting them, so we'll buy them again (very soon judging by the rate our stack is dwindling...).",dogs,3

"Moved into a house with a large walk out basement. It was a great space but the ugly stinky 1970s made it unlivable. We immediately pulled up the carpet and were horrified that the cat pee had penetrated the carpet/pad and seeped into the concrete foundation. In the corners it even absorbed into the base trim and framing. A couple of years and remodeling projects later it was time to tackle the unused basement. We tried everything on the market and all the home ""remedies"" in the world to get the stench out. I really thought we made a mistake by buying the house because the basement could not be saved.I bought 3 gallons of Urine Out and it was 100% effective! Sprayed the concrete using a pressure sprayer (twice) and treated the area along the walls about 4 times. For each treatment the area was covered with a plastic tarp and allowed to dry really slow. The chemical/perfumy smell was present during treatments but a few days after it dried the smell totally went away. Our pets are allowed in the area and haven't been tempted to do what the previous owners cats did. I may seem pricey and a lot of time and effort but it's well worth it!!!",cats,2
"I just LOVE this product. It's much like a Diaper Genie for cat litter. It makes my life easier and more sanitary and smell-free. I adopted 2 rescue cats from a shelter and they came home with a parasite (common in shelter animals) that makes their stool smell reeeeally foul. My 2 litter boxes reeked and when I bagged the clumped litter and tied it up and threw it away (in a tightly covered stainless steel trash can), the trash started to smell like litter box. So I bought one of these because I liked the idea of locking the smells in and only having to empty it every so often. That parasite was the perfect test of how well it contained smells -- PERFECTLY. It makes scooping litter easier and more sanitary. I loved the first one so much that I bought a 2nd one for the 2nd box. The design is easy to use and there's an easy-to-wash compartment for storing the scoop. This is the best invention since clumping litter!! I couldn't recommend it more highly!!",cats,2

Its nose, eye rims and feet are as pink as the day they are born and stay that way for life.) This condition usually means the dog's skin will be extra sensitive & itchy. That is the way it is for our dog. We feed her grain-free premium dog food, which reduces most of the symptoms. Bath time is another issue. Because she is ""a dog"" she is constantly getting in things that usually involve dirt or mud! The Earthbath Oatmeal & Aloe shampoo is really mild, all natural (which I love!) and not perfume-y (which I hate!).

"When we first got our 1 year old hound mix from our local animal shelter, she was no fun to take on walks, she was a very strong puller. I was getting rope burns across the palm of my hands from trying to hold the leash, I was also starting to have problems with my shoulder on that same side. The first time I put on the gentle leader, she didn't like it much and tried to pull it off. I took it off of her and readjusted it (made it tighter) and that seemed to work. On her first walk, she rubbed her muzzle on the ground a few times but then as soon as she got interested in the walk, she forgot all about it. By the second walk, I felt like I was walking a different dog. Yes, she could still pull a little bit, but she couldn't put her full body strength into pulling so it became much easier to control her. The collar comes with a very helpful video and I recommend you watch it because it will help you understand how it works. Now when I walk our dog, Poppy, there is usually very little to no tension on the leash. If I need her to be close to me, it's much easier now to control her and to get her to come to my side. This collar has made walking her more enjoyable. Yes, if it is on her for too long, and if she is standing around with it on and not walking, she will start to rub it. While she is on the walks, sniffing the ground, looking at other dogs, enjoying being outdoors, she seems to take no notice of it. I highly recommend this product if you have a dog that is a puller, but watch the DVD first!",dogs,3
Both my cats (who hate to be groomed) and my new medium-coat Pomeranian love this brush. I think it feels like a massage and they willingly lay down or purr when I am brushing them.

My dog is 16 years old! and did not chew on it. It's ashame because before this I had no problems. Like I said at the beginning, they are ok to use for a few days, but if something goes wrong with them the company seems to not backup their product and are very, very rude.",dogs,3
"This is a cute toy, I guess for a little toy type dog. My dobermans got a hold of it and it was falling apart in minutes. It's value probobly depends on your dog.",dogs,3
"We have a few hens and keeping their water flowing in the wintertime can be tricky (and not a little backbreaking as well!). We got this dish to see if that might solve our problem. It does, but we found that when the cold wind blows, the &#34;girls&#34; stay inside the coop and do their scratching and dust bathing inside. Thus, within only a short while their water bowl was quite mucky.A friend on one of the chicken forums suggested a solution. We now fill the bowl, plug it in and then set our 3 gallon plastic fountain on top of it. The heated water below keeps the water in the fountain tray ice free and the water in the tray keeps the water in the fountain from freezing.If you are getting this to water your chickens in the winter, try this method. It has kept the water in the fountain and it's tray ice free and available into the low teens through the night. The person who first told me about this was from New Jersey and had been using this method for two winters. Their nighttime temps tend to be much lower than ours.Money well spent and now, with a few &#34;adjustments&#34; our girls no only have de-iced water, the also have CLEAN fresh water!!I will tell you...the company told me the cord was 6'. Ours was not quite that, more like 5' or 5 1/2'. We had to raise the bowl on a couple of cinder blocks to reach the electrical outlet which is on the ceiling of our coop...so bear that in mind. It WAS an easy adjustment, but be aware of it.",cats,2

I have 2 littermaids that have been nothing but trouble . Years ago they seemed better . I tried this as I have 4 cats and tired of the Littermaids getting stuck . It really is amazing . I have 2 and they have been using them about 2 months now so easy to change . And the cats took to it no problem . I bought a 6 pk of refills but $ 99 is terrible for a cardboard tray and 4 1/2 pds of litter . I bought the forever trays but am having trouble finding the litter .I couldn't find it online anywhere. Finally found at Target . $13.59 for a 8 lb bag. One bag should do the 2 boxes .I hope it continues to work flawlessly as it has saved me alot of work . Give it a try . Would rate a 5 but expensive litter trays .,cats,2
"A few quick details that might help someone looking for a crate, as I was. I purchased the 36x24x27 model. I am overall very pleased, but have some precautions.- This crate is not only well made and sturdy, but the divider allows you to ""puppy-size"" it and slowly increase the size that your dog has available. I was surprised when my puppy was *much* happier when I gave him less room. I suppose it felt more secure, to have a space closer to his size.- Keep in mind that if you use the divider, it will likely prevent the second door from opening, as the divider hooks onto each side of the crate.- While the crate may be disassembled (it folds flat), it is designed for sliding under a bed or couch. The size is not ideal for traveling. Fully assembled it does not fit in most cars (it won't get through the door), and I was shocked when I couldn't even get it into the back of a Jeep wrangler. It's a big crate!To wrap up... it's an excellent home for a dog, a place he/she can feel comfortable, but it's not made for travel. Consider a ""kennel"" (the plastic crates) if you need an enclosed transport.",dogs,3
Mine hate this thing. they struggle with it and it tightens like a noose! Very difficult to loosen on a panicked ferret. Too loose and they houdini right out of it. All 3 of mine had problems with it.,small animals,5
"We have 3 papillons, and we bought the rubber/plastic collars last year to go with our fence. At the time, I complained that the collar part should be nylon and flexible because the little shocker box thing left a large gap with the neck and collar. It's a weird fit, it made the prongs really dig in, but the collar was very loose.We just added another papillon puppy, and she's about 4lbs, and we got this collar for her. MUCH better fit. We were worried because she could have easily slipped off the older style rubber collar. This one works great!As for the battery life, yes, it sucks! I have thought about taking them apart and putting in a new battery only, and now I will try after reading the reviews. BUT, if my dogs are wearing their collars, they know it, so they do NOT test the boundary lines for at least a month after the battery has died :)",dogs,3
"As recommended by the trainer, we bought several Kongs (black, and one size up) and stuffed them with various levels of food and treats, then popped them in the freezer for a couple of hours before giving them to our dog. We have a 24lb cocker spaniel who can spend hours going at it to get the food out, and even when it's clean, will chew and play with it to no end. She regularly destroys plush toys (to get the squeaky out), rope toys fare a bit better, but the Kong is intact. These items have a 30 day guarantee so extreme chewers can get their money back if the product doesn't stand up to the test.",dogs,3

"The reviews are all telling the truth. It sounds too good to be true but it actually works, don't ask me how. It's just this regular looking comb thing but when you put it on your dog you'll be shocked at how much it de-furs. If you can grab this thing on sale you will save yourself a LOT of time and energy trying to de-fur your dog any other way and cleaning up all the shedding around the house. THIS THING WORKS.",cats,2

"I ordered these as a stocking stuffer for my 3 cats. These springs were not plastic, as the product descriptions said, but METAL coated in a thin plastic. The ends were very sharp, and I sliced open my finger just trying to pull them out of the package. These could easily cut the mouth or paw of a cat or kitten. The springs also smelled strongly of metal and plastic. I wouldn't be surprised if they were made of lead! Do NOT buy these for your cat. This product should be pulled from the market, and I am writing to Amazon to request that they not sell them anymore.",cats,2
"I bought this because my cat's an indoor outdoor cat. He has free reign by way of his kitty door with his own magnetic key. Boy is he spoiled...But anyway, I bought this because Bob came home with several ticks. I found one crawling on him, and one attached to him. Then, I found one crawling on me...oh-no! So I wanted to try Frontline because it claims to be a tick control.Well, it is, kinda. I assumed that Frontline would be something that would give him an aura of ""keep away from me"" for fleas and ticks, much like Pig-Pen's dirt aura did for him in Charlie Brown. However, it doesn't. Now, Bob comes home with ticks, only...they're clinging to the outside of his hair. They won't crawl in and attach, but they're clinging to his hair, and as such, unless I find them when he comes in, they may detach at any time. Since he likes to join us in bed after we're asleep and he's done his nightly field mouse hunt, this is especially troublesome.I don't know what else to do, other than use those nasty flea/tick collars, which I don't want to do. But I suppose since the ticks won't crawl into his hair, technically it's ""control.""",cats,2
"My cat is generally very playful, and he is quite particular when it comes to toys. He doesn't just play with anything. When his toys are all laid out on the floor, he paws at this charmer then looks at me and meows to express his urge to play. Another nice thing is the wire and cardboard ends seem to survive tough-play and chewing. From my cat to yours... Happy Playing!",cats,2
"The rake is way smaller than shown in the picture used to sell the product! I have a large dog in a large back yard and wanted to large rake as showin in the picture. It works well, but the job could be done faster with a larger rake.",dogs,3
"I'll be honest, I don't know a lot about crates. The two door design is very convenient and the divider is nice as she grows we can give her more space. Because of the placement of the doors, I can't make the crate as small as I'd like without losing use of the side door though. Also, there are some clips that hold it together when its packed away that I can't get rid of. My puppy chews on the clips all the time because they're just sticking out.",dogs,3

"I had to return this machine in just a few weeks, Amazon was terrific, I printed out the label and got my refund asap. However the product was not. The motor made too much noise and scared one of my cats, you can't clean it with water so how do you clean it?? The motor after a week got weaker and weaker then finally stopped working. Not meant to be.. I don't know about the other models I'm back to the old fashion box and I scope it myself. The few days that it did work however, I enjoyed the less smelly bathroom because of the fact the the waste was sealed in a little container it did keep the smell to a minimum.If anyone wants one I recomend another model do your homework. I should have listen to the prior reviews they were all right.",cats,2

"I really like the crate but I had a safety concern. I bought a Yorkie. She weighed 12 ounces when I got her. The latches on the side have wires that are a little smaller apart than the bars on the crate. My puppy got her jaw slightly hung in between those wires and it scared her so I put electrical tape around them to close the opening. She was just trying to chew on the wires but the tape solved the problem. I like the divider. I had my son cut a hole in it, file down the edges, and repaint the divider to separate her bedroom from her pottie room and it works really well.",dogs,3
"Probably not a good toy for strong chewers, but my dog loves this! It has so many places for a dog to pick up and carry around. It seems well made for the price, too. As long as your dog plays well with stuffed toys, they should like this.",dogs,3

I've used Frontline in the past and was satisfied with the product but not the price. It is over priced so I did research and found Bio-Spot and I have to say it works great. We just recently moved upstate New York where there are plenty of ticks and my dogs have not gotten 1 yet thanks to Bio-spot...what impressed me even more is that it protects them against Mosquitos too...Frontline doesn't do that and it's almost triple the price. Thank you Bio-Spot for keeping your cost reasonable.,dogs,3

"I have used this product for a number of years. I have one toy poodle that even looks forward to having her teeth cleaned.The toothpaste appears to be very effective, although it probably depends on how it is applied and how often. I clean my dog's teeth 3 or 4 times a week.In small dogs, dental problems are quite common. The longer one can go between cleanings at the vet's, the better. Less risk to the animal plus the bonus of $$$ savings.The 6.2 ounce size sells on Amazon for about the price of of the 2.5 ounce at at the local &#34;discount&#34; pet stores.Good product and good price and service at Amazon.",dogs,3

"Maybe not ""Everlasting"" in a household of 3 American Pit Bull Terriers, but I will say its outlasts just about everyother toy we've tried. Other then the Kongs this is the only other toy that is allowed to stay out to be played with freely. I would not leave it in their crates though. One of my girls has an intense ball drive and is very much a power chewer this is her absolute favorite toy, and after a year and a half it is time for a new one...Definately worth the money!",dogs,3

So far, the geriatric cat is still responding to the product after 2 years of daily doses to keep his GI system moving.We always have at least 3 tubes of this stuff in the house at all times.Additionally, I have been a Revival Animal customer for more than 4 years and have been very happy with the service and the products.",cats,2

That was 2 weeks ago and I have never heard from them again. I sent an e-mail and did not get a reply. Will not do business with these people again.. I feel like I threw away my money. I have nothing to show for it but a collar that does not work.,dogs,3
"This harness, for our slightly larger than usual Rat Terrier, has worked out great with the exception of it rubbing on the backs of his armpits. There doesn't seem to be any redness or chaffing, but his coat is pretty thinned out there compared to before. He doesn't seem to mind at all though, and I think him and I are willing to accept that small detail to avoid neck and throat injuries caused by normal collars. I no longer feel guilty about yanking at his neck when he tries to chase a squirrel, and I feel safe that he can't slip out of it as well. Recommended!",dogs,3

"Loved this product. I have an 11 year foster dog who was hit by a car in Taiwan and the person who hit her just left her there and both of her hind legs were broken as a result. By the time she was found one of her legs did not heal correctly. She was sent to Los Angeles and I have been fostering her since. Due to her leg issues I cannot walk her too far and she would get depressed in my house as I walked my other dogs in my care because she could not come with us.The stroller allows me to walk her with my other dogs and I can put her out to walk and when she gets tired put her back in and that helps her a lot. The seller was really great and it came a lot faster than the estimated time that the mail carrier gives you. The cup holder is a little small and I do not think is meant to carry larger drinks like a smoothie cup but if you put a can of pepsi or something it most likely will fit. My dog did pee in it,but it is not a huge deal if a stain does occur because it will be mostly covered by the wool pad that comes with it. It literally is like a square pad that is made with the fleece or wool that dog beds are made up. Everyone loves this stroller and my dog is a lot happier!!! I would recommend this product and seller to everybody!!!",dogs,3
"We have a 2-year old put bull/lab mix, that loves to play fetch, and throw around his toys by himself. He would chew everything we bought him to pieces within a day, or two. These Planet Dog ""tuff toys"" are the best thing in the world. He loves them, plays with them all the time, and they are indestructible. Best value for the dollar we have found anywhere.",dogs,3
"Our cat loves chasing the mouse, however the pole is incredibly flimsy. We detached the string from the pole and tied it to the pole of another toy that the cat had officially ""killed."" He still loves it. However the metal ball inside the bell has come out so it no longer jingles and that was half the fun! All in all, I wouldn't buy this again.",cats,2
"I loved this soft crate right up until our 8 pound puppy chewed her way through the nylon zipper. Prior to that, she had scractched repeatedly on one side and split the threads of one zipper. When this didn't result in her escape then she literally chewed her way through the nylon zipper in the front flap. So we enjoyed this crate for about 4 months. Now it is unusuable because we can't secure the flaps with the zippers. So, if you have a pet with a penchant for chewing, this may not be the crate for you. I would love it if they would offer a soft crate with metal zipper option.",dogs,3
"All three of my dogs love small squeaky plush toys, so I couldn't resist this neat little set when I saw it. Luckily, I'm not at all disappointed in the impulse buy. In the three weeks I've had it, some of the squeakers have stopped squeaking and a tail came off during a tug of war, but other than that it seems to be holding up. My dogs are rough on toys, so I'm satisfied. They love to yank the critters out of the log and I end up having to collect one from each room whenever I want to reload. My lab especially loves this toy and even plays with the log once it's empty. I'm not sure how much longer the stitching will hold up on some of these things, but I don't think I can place much blame on the maker for that. I do wish the squeakers could be replaced, but that is a minor complaint. I'm sure the dogs wouldn't care if the log was stuffed with any old toys, but I'll definitely be replacing the squirrels if they ever get too shredded. I'll probably even buy one of the other hide-a-toy sets because of how much they (and us humans) seem to be enjoying this one.",dogs,3
"The cats started drinking out of it right away, but it's too loud.The water stays very fresh for days (taste it, you'll see!). I think it's the filter that does it.It's still too loud, Hummmmmmmmm.It's easy to clean. Five stars, if it didn't go Hummmmmmmmm.I can hear it all over the house!",cats,2

"And was I glad I did! I have a black Lab and she didn't seem to have any bad coat problems. After FURminating her, I couldn't believe how much dead, dull undercoat I removed, and how glossy and black her coat looked. The best part is she actually enjoyed it, and came back for more. This is a dog who wouldn't let me near her with a normal dog brush. After my Lab, I moved on to try it on my sister's Welsh Corgi and Golden Retriever. Same excellent results, and the Corgi, who HATES brushing, sat still the entire time. This is one tool that seems to live up to the advertising.",cats,2

"I have purchased several of these over the past few months. We have a few pets and I want to make sure that there is no confusion as to whether the clips are for ""people food"" or ""pet food"" (the face of the clip has a picture of pets on it). Clip is oversized and has a rubber edge that grips the food bag better than a regular clip. The spring of the clip is not as strong as I expected, but probably better for us so that our 3 year old does not pinch his finger when playing with the clip.",cats,2
"Noodle LOVES this toy!!!! I mean, absolutely LOVES it!! We have so much fun while playing together, and she gets some GREAT excercise! She actually DANCES! I make sure to be careful due to the wire construction the toy is made with, so I would not reccommend you let children use it to play with the cat, but I DO intend to order more for the ADULT cat lovers I know.",cats,2

"I have previously purchased these cat bowls locally, but they are no longer available in the stores around me. I am very happy to find them here. I use them in an elevated cat feeding stand and they fit perfectly. These are the only bowls that I have found (besides the original metal bowls that came with the stand) that do fit in it properly. While they are called liners, I use them as the regular food bowls with great success.The bowls have lasted for years with regular use and hand washing. After a few years of use, some have developed cracks in the plastic (most likely from holding the filled bowl by the little tab on the side instead of from underneath). I highly recommend these bowls for someone who wants to fill their pet's food bowl (in some type of pet feeding stand) and rotate out the previous bowl and clean it. I have 2 bowls in the feeder and 2 bowls in the dish drainer each day.Also, it has made transporting the cats to a different house easier. I do not mind leaving the plastic bowls in a relative's house when I visit with the cats. While I put the bowls in an elevated feeder, they can sit on the floor and be used as a bowl on its own as well.",cats,2

The feeder is great! It does make a sound when it rotates, but it only lasts for 2 seconds. It's nice because the noise lets my cat know it's time to eat. The feeder is really easy to set up as well. It actually has a clock that you set and then you set the ""feeding times"". The directions to set up the clock and feeding times are located under the lid of the feeder. I love that because I will never lose the directions!",cats,2

"The 1st time with these treats, my experience was fine. My yorkie is amazingly picky about his food/treats, so I'm always thrilled when he likes anything. He loved these treats! Just bought another bag and gave some to him over the past few days and noticed he'd hack after eating one. I figured they were dry Bc he never did this before. I was going to give him one this morning before our walk when I noticed coarse, long hairs all crammed into the marrow!! I pulled 2 strands out of one marrow and examined them. They were thick, light brown/Blonde and about 1/4 in long. No wonder my poor dog was hacking! He just had a mouthful of hair! I checked more of them & found more hair. I contacted Pedigree and am no longer buying their products. It was disgusting. Save your dog's stomach and spend a few extra bucks on something that's actually quality treats for your dog(s) and more nutritious and wholesome .... not chock full of hairs!(The only reason for having 2 stars is due to my dog loving them so much...!)",dogs,3

Due to it's shape, you don't have a good grip on it when picking it up from the floor, unless you use both hands. Although it holds about up to 2 to 2 and a half cup of food, I think I would prefer a feeder a little bigger for my 40 lbs dog. Unfortunatly it only comes in one size.",cats,2

"I purchased this particular pet bed based on customer reviews, and I am very happy with it. I have a 80lb pit-mix and was looking for a good outdoor bed for him. We always used his old beat up Costco dog beds outdoors, but after the last monsoon we realized we needed something more sanitary and easier to clean which is why I started looking for these types of dog beds. My dog is rather large and he fits on this bed just fine, with some extra room even. My husband has a smaller pitbull and we are thinking of ordering one for her next. She is a little skittish and we were not sure how she would like a raised bed so we only ordered one, but she seems interested so I am sure we will be purchasing her a bed of her own in the near future so both of our dogs will have a nice cool place to lay out when they are outdoors.",cats,2

"If you've never had a ""Kennel Trained"" dog, you're missing a good bet.

I'm on my second one in less than 2 weeks. The first came with a battery that lasted barely a week and when I replaced the battery it got stuck. It frequently stops working just when I need the correction the most like when my huge puppy takes off after the cat. Then I have to remove it and sync it again and again. I've had the second one for a week and the battery died. I have not even been able to consistently use it so overuse isn't the issue.,dogs,3
"We have had this window perch for over a year, and really love it. Our cat uses it every day. It is sturdy enough for my almost 2 year old son to stand on, and is easy to install. The only fault with it is the metal tabs that hook over the bottom of the inside of the window prevent the window from closing all the way. There's no gap, there just isn't a tight seal so there's a small draft. It may not be this way on all windows, but it is on ours. I'm sure there's an easy work around I haven't thought of, but we just live with it and enjoy it anyway. The color and carpeting are also nice and blend in with our wall color perfectly. I hardly notice it's there.",cats,2

"I purchased this item to thwart a cat who insists on using the garden under my bedroom windows as her litter box. The first couple of days, I still went out and found the presents mixed in with my perrenials. However, I respositioned the device and it has now been 7 days with no more occurrences. Of course, my indoor cat who loves to sit in the window went a little crazy the first couple of days.",cats,2
This was our dogs very first toy. We got it before we brought him home at age 8 weeks. We rubbed it on all his litter mates before he left the litter. He slept with it his first nights with us. We took a picture with lambchop and our puppy when we brought them home. Our son saw the photo and thought we had two puppies rather than one. It lasted about three months with him playing with it many times daily. He uses it as a chew and a tug toy and loves that it has 5 squeakers. We now have a second one. He also loves to chase and fetch it when we throw it. It holds up well in both machine washer and dryer. The seams of the rear legs had to be repaired on the second when they came undone. The fabric on the muzzle is most prone to tearing.,dogs,3
"We bought this to go under our childrens car seat and protect the seat from potty training slips and drink spills (Have your kids ever spilled chocolate milk in the car? its stinks!) It has done a great job of protecting the truck seats while still letting us buckle the kids seats in properly. After every gross spill or just periodically as needed I unbuckle the kids seats and take 'em out pull out the seat cover and toss it in the washer, I've even put it in the dryer on low even though it says not to because of the back liner. I live in central california and that means coldish winters and scorching summers and so far (two years) there is no damage or visable wear to the cover or its backing. Well worth the price!",dogs,3

"Overall, I like this dog pen. Each panel is attached like a hinge. The long hinge pins slide in and out easily for assembly and disassembly. You can adjust the size and shape of the pen by adding or removing panels. Very versatile. The main problem I have with the product is that the rubber stopper on the top of each pin falls off and gets lost and then it is harder to pull the hinge pins in and out beacuse they fall too far down. Also, the two rubber stoppers on the bottom of each panel fall off easily and the pen no longer grips the floor very well (they should have pre-installed these with a strong glue). That said, this product still serves my purposes because I like to stow it away during the day. It is light and relatively easy to take apart and put back together.Oh yes, one other small irritant. When I first got the product and opened the box, it was time consuming and difficult to properly install the pet door because of all the screws and latches and parts. I wish they would have installed this door at the factory and saved me the hassle.",dogs,3
I am changing my review because for my recent dog he was able to get a chunk out already. This is NOT a toy for powerful chewers as others have said. It worked fine for my smaller 30lb dog but NOT for my 8month old (now 1yr old) White German Shepherd. I have to keep an eye out that he doesn't start taking more chucks out. He loves this toy and it does what it needs to but its NOT DURABLE like they claim it is!I'd only recommend this for med-smaller sized dogs.,dogs,3
"I work at a pet store, and we've used this litter for our cats in the store's adoption program. I'm the one who cleans the litter boxes every day. This litter may be natural, flushable, and generally healthier for your cat, but the smell is horrendous. I put plenty of litter in each box, and the cats have never had diarrhea. However, the smell from the litter is that of strong vomit, and it's enough to bring me to the point of vomiting myself.If you live in a large house, or have your litter in an unoccupied basement, then this shouldn't be a major issue. If your living arrangements are rather small, then you should choose a different litter. I recommend Swheat Scoop and the Healthy Pet varieties in my high-end pet store for customers who want a natural product, and use Tidy Cats myself which I buy in Target because it has superior odor control.",cats,2

"Been using this product for several years with our older cat...it lasted close to a month. When we adopted two kittens, now giving us 3, I found the 1 month went down to a little over 1 week - which is what is stated. Keeps the odor down and makes life easer.

It definitely speeds up the process and seems to be working so far. You do have to give it a little bit of time for him to figure out he needs to go, but it wasn't nearly as long as it was before. I'm a little worried I might have to rely on it, but we just started using it so we'll see.",dogs,3

Immediately she knew something was different, and once we began to walk she qucikly tried to run away.

"Having to place your cat&#8217;s litter box near an entry way is not ideal; however, this planter style box is perfect. Everyone who has visited has complimented me on my new planter purchase; it is that realistic. One of the nice elements of this cat box, other than the camouflage effect is that it holds a lot of litter and the deeper well allows for better clumping. To make scooping a rounded container easier just shimmy the box so that the litter clumps pull away from the sides then you can easily scoop. We also use Tidy Cat instant action or small spaces brand litter, both have great odor control and clumping action. The artificial palm plant that comes with the planter does require some styling to appear realistic but since we have a real palm at home, I just mimicked the growth pattern to bend the artificial plant in a similar way. The results were very nice.One reviewer mentioned the lid was hard to replace and I agree it can be a little difficult, nothing that would deter me from using it, but I have found if you line up the edges with the entry opening it is a little easier to guide the outer edge back on the bottom. Overall would highly recommend this product it has been a great solution for our smaller home. This is a pricy litter box, but in my opinion worth every penny!",cats,2
"This lead has been great for my small terrier. He would pull and choke himself on a standard collar and would still pull with a harness. This lead has worked better than the hours of training I've spent with him on a regular lead. It does take some time to master the process of harnessing the dog, and it's not quick. I don't use this on car trips, but for regular walking it's perfect for me and my dog.",dogs,3

"I had a gentle Leader years ago when I had a very large Lab that I got as a rescue dog and she was over a year old and had never been leash trained. The gentle leader worked like a charm, she went from an unruly disaster every time we went out to a saint.My mother who has a young dog that pulls too much and nothing seemed to work to fix the problem. After I talked to her on the phone and she told me how her shoulders were acting up from a previous injury because of walking the dog... I immediately had a gentle leader shipped to her. It has worked perfectly yet again. my mother can now walk her dogs without any pain or worry. If you have an unruly dog... you need a gentle leader!!",dogs,3

I suggest it for anyone who has a yard and a dog... I would certainly replace this with an identical product if it broke, or was lost, or stolen, or destroyed in an act of God.Now that winter has appeared in the mid-west, I have discovered that the ""Wire rake scooper for grass"" is really best on the grass. Not the greatest on frozen ground...does OK on snow, but sort of useless on the hard earth, it can't get underneath the business. I think I'll have to consider another type for the winter.

"Now, they even have them in the south!The Gentle Leader should not be confused with other head collars like the Halti. It is FAR superior for any dog breed or temperament.I've trained both my Golden Retrievers as well as the dogs of several relatives and many friends over the past six years using the Gentle Leader. With the possible exception of toy breeds, this is a God-send for any dog owner with a rambunctious, head-strong or hard to handle canine or if you just wants more control without the extra work and even trauma associated with neck collars in general.I had my first Gentle Leader dog and then my second, walking and STAYING at heel, sitting automatically upon stopping, turning both left & right and no longer lunging, pulling, jumping or straying...and all within less than 15 minutes for EACH dog! Golden Retrievers are, of course, wonderfully easy and willing to train anyway, but this was SO incredibly fast, it was almost like watching some magic trick being performed.It was my vet at Fort Lewis, WA who first taught me how to fit the collar and use it. Application is simple once you see it done for the first time. Just place the nose strap short of the flesh on the nose (allowing the dog to breathe, eat, drink and even carry items) and tightten the head strap about one finger tight behind the ears (base of the head, really). This gives you control (nose strap) and the dog a sense of well-being (head strap). Nothing at all is on the dogs neck or throat. I strongly encourage you to have someone experienced with the Gentle Leader's use show you hot to fit it properly the first time.For all dogs I've since trained or assisted in their training there has been the short-lived ""leader dance"". This is where, after placing the leader for the first time, the dog hops in the air and then bows to the ground all the while with both front paws over it's nose while trying remove the collar. As you continue to give short firm tugs on the collar while continuing to walk the dog, the dance quickly disappears within just a few yards. I was amazed at how consistant this behaviour and its let up always is.The leader basically uses the same physical restraint that a mother dog or pack alpha male uses to control a puppy or young dog. A grip over the nose and pressure at the back of the neck. It's purely coincidental that it looks like a horse halter.The control comes from the strap over the nose. The leash clips to the bottom of this strap (under the lower jaw). A short, quick (but not violent) tug on the leash leash brings the entire head under control. The head follows the nose and where the head goes, the body must follow.There is NEVER any need for jerking, pulling or strangling of the dog. There is never leash rope burns from having the dog take control and lunging away with you. Your arms stay in their sockets, palm blisters are a thing of the past (especially if you use a cotton leash, or at least a leather one...NEVER use chain or poly-fiber leashes).Some breeds with huge necks and a high pain tolerance, such as Rottweilers, are easily and gently brought into line. My brother's was 2 years old and completely out of control. He was at heel, sitting and turning within 5 minutes or so and after I turned the dog over to my brother for about 15 minutes I took the dog back and let his 6 year old daughter lead him around. My cute tiny niece was less in control than the dog, yet they both performed as a team with ease.The coolest thing about the Head Collar is how the dogs get really excited when they see it, knowing that it's going for a walk, training or just out in public. They LOVE the Gentle Leader.The Gentle Leader is only used for training or control. The dog STILL wears its own neck collar, but only to keep his tags on, since dogs don't normally come with pockets.The Gentle Leader is also a huge facilitator for ""off-leash"" training. The dog is so comfortable in taking properly given commands on leash, that doing so ""off-leash"" seems to take only one half to one third the normal time I was once involved. That, my friends, is a super endorsement, alone!One last caution...I pray you are in no way a person who ""stakes"" out a dog for ANY reason. Regardless, the Gentle Leader should NEVER EVER be used to keep a dog attached to a stake or wire run. Running out to the end of the line and coming up short by the neck/shoulders is one thing with a neck collar. Staking a dog and KNOWING that a head collar will actually jerk and twist the head to snap the neck is nothing less than cruelty, if not out and out murder. Use the Gentle Leader ONLY with a leash with YOU on one end and the dog on the OTHER, please.I hope you found this useful, as I KNOW you find the Gentle Leader to be. Take care and pass a good time with your canine friend.",dogs,3

"This is the first time I have written a review for a product on Amazon, but I just had to this time. We have a wonderful dog we adopted two years ago, but he started barking a few months ago, and it was driving us crazy. Any noise in our yard, the doorbell or knock on the door would send him into a barking jag. He would usually stop when we yelled at him, but it was all the time. When I put the collar on him I was worried that it would bug him, but it didn't seem to bother him in the least. The first time he went out to bark at something in the yard he got out one bark and that was it, quiet. I thought maybe this would change, but no, the barking has all but stopped.

"This product works wonders. I have two maltese, both of which have extremely bad tear stains. My two year old maltese had a clean white face when we bought him, but after only a few days, ugly brown stains showed up on his face. I tried Eye Envy (you had to actually clean their face with some herbal smelling green liquid, then put powder on their face) but that was too much work with very little change. I used tear stain cleaners from PetCo etc. but those only helped lighten the tear stains, and only after you washed their face. Leave it alone for a few days and they were back. Finally, after endless searching, I found the website for Angels' Eyes and decided to try it. It is a powder that you just sprinkle on their food (I use it with soft food) and it WORKS! Just after three days, I noticed a change. Now, both of my dogs are tear stain free, and after a while, you can start lowering the dosage so you don't go through so many bottles. It is a bit pricey, but the price I found here was a deal. About $40 for a 120 gram bottle... cheapest I've found for such a great product.Note",dogs,3

"Bettas can live in small tanks without filtration and without aeration. However, without filtration their water MUST be changed regularly--not topped off as it evaporates, as evaporation doesn't remove fish waste or nitrates from the existing water. With a one gallon container (the approximate size of this bowl), owners can expect to replace the water once or twice a week, which is no big deal with a tabletop bowl but probably a bit inconvenient with a wall-mounted bowl.Goldfish, on the other hand, need large amounts of water with filtration and aeration. First, they are large fish--they grow up to a foot in length--and thus need a larger quantity of water to maintain them. Second, they are inefficient eaters and produce a lot of waste, and so filtration (and enough water to accomodate their waste) is a must. Third, they are cold water fish, and cold water holds more oxygen; no room-temperature bowl can provide enough. A single gallon will not keep a goldfish alive long, and will not keep it healthy.As for other ""easy-to-maintain"" fish, I have my doubts. A fish may be hardy enough to survive a while in a tiny unfiltered tank, but hardy and healthy are not the same things. In addition, most of these fish will need at least one gallon PER fish, which puts schooling species at a distinct disadvantage.Which brings me to the reviewer who keeps a betta and two African Dwarf Frogs in this bowl and only changes water once every two weeks. Despite the fish lasting 'a whole year' so far, the tank really is overcrowded and under-maintained. The proof is not that the fish and frogs have lasted a year, but whether they last their full lifespan--seven years for the betta, between ten and twenty years for the frogs.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This product is an incredible waste of money, at least for a single-cat household. The construction is shoddy, the components are cheap, and the design of the litter receptacle clips can cause a full one to snap suddenly out of place while removing it, which can create a much bigger mess than the scoop ever did. I'll try lining the receptacles with plastic bags as one reviewer suggested... Also, I had to scrape litter-and-urine cement off the bottom of the old box, with the Littermaid I get to scrape it off the rake as well. Yaaay. And you'd better wear goggles if that rake ever gets stuck with the motor grinding away...I don't know what kind of toxoplasmosis you can get when it flings a chunk of cat litter in your eye, but I'll know soon.",cats,2

"We bought this product for our Lab and Cat to share, our cat needs running water otherwise she does not drink enough, but our lab would drink the cats fountain dry in a matter of hours. The down side with this fountain is the bowl is extremely high, not good for a cat or a small dog, but we still use the cat's fountain in a location that the dog can't get to. The storage in the reservoir is great, I don't have to fill it but about every 3-5 days. Another bonus to a fountain is that the animals stay hydrated better, but this also means more liquids coming out so be ready for more trips outside.",dogs,3

"I bought this litter box about three weeks ago. I read a million reviews on it and thought it would be a great product minus the expense of the trays every two weeks (I have two cats). I use to clean out the litter box every five days or so because of the smell. So after ready a ton of reviews I saw that people were using liners on the disposable tray to extend its life span. I didnt know which ones so use so I tried it out with the ones I had on hand. They are the tidy Cat liners for multiple cats. they come in a little yellow box, about four per box. My cats dig and scratch like crazy in their regular litter box so i was a bit skeptical about them breaking the bag and it getting caught on the rake. So this is what i did. I laid down an UNOPENed liner on top of the disposable tray and taped the sides down. if you don't tape it down properly, litter crystals will get under the bag and not let the rake pass (or so i read from reviews) Also, before taping it down, I made sure that the liner was flush against the tray so that when I filled it with the litter, it would'nt create air gaps that could end up being torn by the cats. It worked great!! 16 days later when it was time to change out the litter, i untaped the liner and easily picked it up from the 4 corners and into the trash. Easy peasy!! From changing it out I noticed the lid of the poop cover had gotten a little wet so i taped it up. i use clear packing tape for everything. Next time i buy a new tray I'll tape up the poop cover right away. I plan on buying a new tray every two months or so instead of every two weeks. The tray looked brand new when i removed the used liner and litter so i may be able to use it for more than two months. we shall see.",cats,2

"Having used a regular tray with a scoop for many, many years, this Omega Litter Box is a godsend. While the name Self-Cleaning is a bit misleading (you still have to do the work), the work required is minimal. Simply roll the box nearly vertical to the right side, give the bottom a whack (sometimes the clumps stick), and roll back to horizontal (plus a little to even the litter out). Now you can just pull out the drawer and empty it out! Makes cleaning the litter box a snap and something that only takes 30 seconds total.The only negative I see is that when you do change out the old litter (otherwise it fills with the small nuggets that get through...ugh), you may need to scrap the bottom as clumping litter may stick a little. but all in all, much improved from the old digging for gold method (I'm sticking with the nuggets metaphor).",cats,2

"I have spent a fortune keeping my 2 indoor cats and my 1 indoor/outdoor dog on Frontline. A FORTUNE! They say you have to keep them ""dropped"" year round, and I have. They still have been infested with fleas and my dog got a tick somewhere along the line and now has lyme disease!!! The fleas are so bad that I have vet appointments for both of my cats next Saturday, my long haired cat is going to have to be shaved!!! In total for drops for the animals, and the spray and powder for the carpets, flea shampoos for the animals I have spent well over $600. In theory, since I kept them ""dropped"" and never missed a date, the dog should have never brought the fleas in in the first place. After the vet appointment for the 2 cats, my grand flea total will be around $1000 in the last month and a half.The people at PetSmart have told me that the fleas in our area seem to be building a tolerance to it. That the outbreak this year has been so bad that they have had lots of people complaining that the drops aren't working! Wish someone had told me that before I spent all that money buying the drops in the first place, just to have to turn around and traumatize my animals with weekly flea baths, flea dips, flea powders, and vet appointments!Do you know how ridiculous the poor cat is going to look shaved?!?!!?

Chose weight control to help our lab lose a little weight. This food has helped do exactly that.

"I have five dogs and several of these crates. I have tried other brands to try to save some money because these are a little pricey but I have found in the long run well worth the money. Petsmart used to carry these but they no longer carry them at my local store. I tried one of their other brands and when I went to put my dog up for the night the edges were so sharp they sliced my finger open. This happened twice and then I threw the crate out. I then tried another brand. That crate lasted 8 months and then broke. That's when I looked for these on Amazon. My first petmate crate is now at least 8 yrs old and is used everyday. I had read some of the other reviews where others had safety problems. This is only happened once with one of my dogs. My large boxer learned that if he headbutted the top of his crate the sides would fall in and he could get out. A few zipties solved that problem. He has a 48 inch crate so it isn't moved very often. My dogs have never been hurt using these crates and furthermore I haven't either. However, I wouldn't recommend leaving your dog alone for an extended period of time until you know how they will react. (But that should be a rule for any crate) :)",dogs,3

I also saw that it's funnier for my conures because they can bath on the cup and for the cup with food they love to dive into the foot get whatever they love to eat and play with the food pushing with their head all over the place. But because bowl is deep (32oz) there is no much food thrown on the floor. I mean, compared to a regular bowl you can buy in a pet store.",birds,0
"I was so excited to get this litter box. The idea seemed great, and with all the positive reviews, what was there to lose? Apparently a lot of time and part of my sanity.The premise is that you roll the litter box and a screen filters the clotted litter into a separate compartment. This might work for some people if the litter clumps tightly and firmly.My issues are numerous. Firstly, the hole the cat goes in is fairly low. This causes litter to not only be tracked, but to spill when the cat tried to bury waste. Litter also flies out the edges when you try and tilt the box to clean it.Tilting didn't work at all for me to clean it. I would get clumps in the waste compartment, plus a ton of clean litter! A lot of clumps also stay in the main compartment of the box.Further, I find the screen the is suppose to separate clean and dirty litter tends to break up urine clumps, resulting in numerous tiny clumps that are impossible to skim out and reek of ammonia.The screen and notches that hold the screen in place create lots of places for waste to get stuck. I regularly have to clean these places with paper towels.Right now I'm using it as a regular litter box. I'm going to try it with Arm and Hammer Super Clumping Litter next (I'm using their natural litter, which I previously liked). If that doesn't work it's off to the Tidy Cat system. If it does work, I'll update my review appropriately.",cats,2

"Good part first:This makes my dog more calm and happy on colder days. After only one wearing, he put up no fuss as I worked it over his head the second time after washing it (more below about that.)It looks cute on him, and fits him snugly. The fabric appears durable and thick enough to stand up to him rolling around in it and otherwise rough-housing. It has a little hood, and a hole to run a chain/leash through the back of the neck part to his collar.The not-so-good part. The makers didn't apparently anticipate dogs like to urinate on walks. This is long enough, (or my dog is long enough) that although he lifts his leg to pee, his pecker is still stuck inside the jacket, so that he's effectively pissing on the front of the jacket, on the inside...Oops! As he walks and pisses (or tries to), the entire front gets soaked. Yuck. I took it off him immediately as we got home, and washed it, and my hands. I'm not a prude, but don't want him resting on the floor or a rug in a pee-soaked jacket any more than I'd want a human being doing it. It should have been cut shorter, or perhaps had a ""V"" cut in that area for somewhat more endowed dogs.The fix",dogs,3

The way our kitchen is designed we are able to separate the pen and set up the sections in the doorways to contain the pups in the kitchen for a little romp without giving them access to the carpeted areas. But, since the sections are easy to move, it's a cinch for us to move from room to room. One section of the pen has a door for the pups to exit/enter when it's time to join the family.I don't believe this pen is solid enough for larger dogs, but for the small ones it is wonderful.",dogs,3

"I doubt there is a cat out there that would not be interested in this toy. In fact, we found out the hard way that if you leave the toy out, it will be destroyed. One of my cats must think it's a real bird so she will kick and scratch and bite it to pull off and eat the feathers, so we have to keep it out of reach when not in use. I'd give it 5 stars if they were built a little bit stronger. I'm only giving 3 stars because we've gone through so many of these that it is no longer an option to purchase more. When one of my cats catches it in mid air, in a split second she can break and shred it. She's unbelievable with this toy and appears to be a total hunting machine. If I let her outside there wouldn't be a bird or squirrel around for miles. So, anyway, I wish these feather toys were made to last. Unfortunately, the toy is incredible but just not very durable if you have a cat that plays hard. On the other hand, I have a cat that loves to play with the toy and she does not try to destroy it if she catches it, so it really just depends on the voraciousness of your cat.",cats,2
"I have an 8 yr. old, 10 lb. cat, and two days after this box arrived all I could think was ""where have you been all my life"". Over the years we have tried many different types of litter boxes... the plain ones without a top have easy access, but litter ends up everywhere, the ones with a top are more difficult to clean... And let's face it, you're still having to sift and scoop, the electric ones are costly and easily break, but this one, this one is pure genius. My cat has no problem using it... I did leave her regular box in the same place and let her ease into using the new one, by day 3 she had completely stopped using the old box and was using this new one. As I stated, she weighs 10 lbs. and the regular sized litter box is a perfect size for her, however, a larger cat would definitely need to use the large litter box. I can't stress enough how happy I am with this purchase, except to say that every one of my friends and family that have cats are getting this litter box for Christmas. I highly recommend this litter box... Go on YouTube and input Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box to see how it's used... Those of you with kids will never have to change the kitty litter again because your kids will be fighting over who gets to do it.

"This is our 3rd jug. My dog Loooooves it and eats his dinner out of it every night. Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!",dogs,3

The vet prescibed this for my elderly cat who was having issues getting around. I found opening a capsul and mixing with soft food worked well with getting her to eat it.

"I don't recommend this clicker if you plan to be multi-tasking while training your dog. Because the button sticks out, it's too easy to make an unintentional click. The last thing you want to do is click when your dog has just lunged with the leash to go chase a squirrel (unless, of course, you're teaching your dog to lunge and chase squirrels). I've gone back to using my simple box clicker, especially when going on walks",dogs,3

"Two new kittens have joined our 8 and 12 year olds. Took this out of the box, placed it on the floor, and I think I may have moved the ball myself once. Not sure about that actually - it may have just moved on its own as I placed the toy down. Whichever, the kittens were all over it in a heartbeat.They do pop the ball out on occasion, but we haven't lost it yet. Which is a distinct improvement over standalone balls, which wouldn't last 3 minutes in this house. Between furniture, nooks and crannies of the house, and my preschooler + her ""stuff""... well there's a lot of places to lose cat toys. With this, they just love the ball zooming round the track, and will even take up posts on either side of it to smack the ball back and forth to each other. Too cute! And it's easy to drop the ball back in the track from time to time.They like the catnip on the cardboard, and will lay right on it rubbing their heads against the grain. But they haven't yet taken it up as a scratching post. I'm interested to see how it holds up to that. I had read the info that the center circle is a piece of corrugated, but hadn't quite pictured what that really meant. Imagine if you will that someone took several flat pieces of cardboard, with all of the edges lined up, and rolled them into a cylinder - like making cinnamon rolls. Cut a slice from the cylinder and you would have a flat disk that is a spiral of cardboard edges. That's what you have here. Means that there's a good texture to it for the cats, but it IS just cardboard so I'm not sure how long it will really last against sharp little claws. We'll see.",cats,2

"I was looking for Mr. Bill stuff, and came across this plush dog toy. My daughter has a combination lab and pit bull, and she's always needing new toys for her dog, so I bought this item for her.This is a great dog toy, for those of you who appreciate the sick humor of Mr. Bill. When squeezed, the plushie goes ""Oh Nooooooo..."" instead of the usual squeaky noise. My daughter loved it, her dog loved it, and all was well with the road.Unfortunately, after a day of dog play, the mutt managed to bite -through- the squeaker, rendering Mr. Bill mute. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't blame the Mr. Bill plushie for this problem. This dog has been known to eat remote controls - literally. The dog can tear through a large rawhide toy in a day.So, if you are planning on buying this plushie, perhaps you should consider a slightly smaller dog. And perhaps the manufacturer might consider making the internal squeaker a little more like Mr. Bill himself - who can take everything you can dish out and keep right on saying, ""Oh Nooooooo....""All said and done, I like this item very much.",dogs,3

"A stray cat adopted us after surviving last winter outside and on her own. She would never alllow us to get within 100 yards, until one day decided we were ""OK"". What a sweet animal. But a cat and inside the house is not an option, so we got this pad and placed it inside a wooden cat carrier in the garage. She loves being on this pad, and now we know where to find her. We have many coyotes so keeping her wandering to a minimum was a good thing. Great idea, great product so far - had it about 3 months now.",cats,2

BTW, Home Depot has very reasonable prices on these collars and PetSafe stuff, some you have to order and some is available in store.

It was about the only sweater I could find that looked like it would fit a Great Dane and was decently priced.Both our Danes love the sweater and have no complaints about wearing it. I love the drawstring it has, as they have huge chests and not so huge mid-sections.The only thing I didn't like about them is that they are a little light weight. Looking at the title, it is made out of the thermal material, but I did expect them to be a little thicker.That being said, they serve their purpose and the Danes seem happy. I'll buy them again.",dogs,3
"This toy is a great size for a small puppy. Our Charlene-Amanda (Char-manda! the Jackabee) was 10 weeks old when we got her and 5 pounds and she fell in love with this toy we call 'Loopy'.'Loopy' is a soft toy with grabby-loops on all sides. It's easy to throw and easy for even young pups to retrieve. However, even with pretty easy use Loopy is falling apart at the seams and the stuffing is falling out after only two months.THE SKINNY:::If you can live with needing to replace the toy after a couple of months, then do get this. It really is a wonderful design for small puppies. (Certainly way too small for big dogs.) However, I can't recommend it for people who don't have time to get out a needle and thread and do a repair job themselves.Pam T~mom/blogger/dog loverUPDATE:Well I had to give this toy an extra star as I broke down and bought another one. I did so because I misplaced the first -- or the kids did, or maybe the dog... -- and we are all missing the darn thing. In addition, we adopted a companion dog for our beloved Jack mix and thought he's a bit bigger than Charlie was at 8 weeks, Loopy seemed like a great choice. And in fact, the new pup loves Loopy too, and I'll report back on how MachII holds up so you'll have more evidence for your own decision.December 2011",dogs,3

I was a hesitant because of the price but I was having problems with my 3rd rake type device and I needed to replace it.Needless to say, after a year, it is still going strong and I love it. My cat took abut a day to get used to it. In the beginning he loved to watch it go around and played with it, but now he just leaves it alone. It does make some noise when it works, but not too bad. Probably not a great idea for the bedroom if your cat will use it in the middle of the night, but anywhere else is just fine.It uses regular plastic waste bags. You just pull the old one out and the new one goes in very quickly. I have never had a bag come out of place.You won't regret buying one, I don't!!!!",cats,2

Test the ph of your pure tap water to see which way you'll usually have to movethe PH.It is concentrated, so add it AFTER you've added the water to treat, otherwise you'll see your fish freak outas they get hit with a blast of acid.

"This seems to be made of soft rubber and when compared to your average brush for cats, this one is far superior. I found that I can easily grip it (it's about the length of my hand, maybe a little shorter) and the tendril-like bristles are firm enough to pick up hair, but flexible enough that my cat seems to enjoy the process. I also found it to be easier to clean than your traditional brushes, not only because of the wide bristles, but because it can be rinsed after easily after use.",cats,2
"This litterbox took some experimentation at first. Don't fill with litter above the fill line - it actually works better if it is a little low.I re-use the receptables and have no problem with the odor. A little baking soda in the litter box tray is helpful if it gets a little strong. As needed you should empty the raked litter and start with a clean, fresh box. This averages about once a month for us (three cats with an accessible backyard). Sometimes the cats come running in from outdoors to use it.I keep a screwdriver by the litterbox to flick through the rake and remove any fecal matter that sticks to the teeth. A putty scraper works great for occasionally scraping the bottom clean.I work odd shifts, and to keep the litterbox from waking us up every so often, I put a timer on the box plug-in. It only operates about 10 hours a day, and doesn't get used so heavily that it plugs up. If you had heavy cat use, you would need to have it run more hours, or set for intermittent operation.With a standard litterbox, we were cleaning two or three times a day just to keep the box decent. I empty the Littermaid receptacle once a week, right before garbage day. We use clumping litter from a wholesale store. Experimentation with various litters produced no significant difference in cleanliness, efficiency, etc.There will be occasional fecal balls that evade capture. You can scoop them or ignore them; they'll eventually be gone. We also put a Rubbermaid lid from an underbed box beneath the Littermaid, as it is in a carpeted room, and there was a lot of litter scatter. The ramp is worthless; we don't use it. They jump over the side instead of wiping their feet on the matting. There's still some litter in the rug, but most of it gets caught in the lid.",cats,2
"My husband and I decided to evict our cats' litter box from the laundry room to the screened in back porch. Of course, we didn't want to have something out there that screamed, ""I'm a litter box!"" so I looked for something that was incognito. I'd seen the exact same box in a catalog for more than twice as much, and once again Amazon came through! I received the box in about three days, and it looks great. Even the plant isn't as cheesy in person as I'd envisioned. The overall quality is very good, and is plenty large enough for my three-cat household. I'm 100% satisfied with this purchase.",cats,2
"Our young cat pees on anything new. The Urine Off has a pleasant Febreeze-like smell unlike some of the other cleaners that were almost worse than the cat pee. I will say that I don't exactly find it as pleasant as I used to since I now associate the smell with cat pee, but friends and neighbors won't at least. You need a lot of the stuff, though. I mean a lot. Don't think you can just spray a little down. You need to pour because it has soaked down into the carpet and padding and subfloor or well into the innards of your furniture. The uv light that came with the tiny spray bottle I first got at an area pet retailer does a good job of locating the spots in very dark conditions, but you will need a much larger bottle than that unless your cat has been very discriminating in his inappropriate peeing. You're also going to need some way to get it back up from the carpet after it dries. So you'll either need a friend who doesn't mind repeatedly loaning his/her carpet cleaner or consider the investment yourself. My mom's getting a little irritated with the borrowing. I've ordered another gallon and hope it arrives soon. Since it does NOT seem to stop repeat soiling for me, I'm on to cat attract litter to see if that works.",cats,2
"I needed a weatherproof dog house for our Beagle. I checked reviews of other products, but wasn't satisfied with their ratings/reviews. I saw the Igloo dog house at Tractor Supply (where it was much more expensive). I saw that overall it has good ratings, so I decided to order online. My Beagle pup is 5 months old and she has plenty of room to grow in her Medium Igloo. We stuffed it full of straw to keep her warm this winter. She loves to snuggle up in the corner away from the opening. She stays warm and dry in her house. I am so happy I purchased this doghouse!",dogs,3

She has barely touched it in the four weeks she has had it. I'm giving this 3 stars because it is made well and maybe some dogs do like them, just not mine. So I'm still looking for something she can enjoy but not devour in 1 or 2 hours. Also tried one of the edible Nylabones, this she liked but it was gone in less than 10 minutes.",dogs,3

I missed a dose and he started scratching his ears again. I put some in and no problems since! Thank you! Will buy more as needed for sure!,dogs,3
"I got the green large size for my 2 cocker spaniel puppies. They like to lay on it together. They also dive, run and play on it. They have also caused a bit of damage from chewing on the fabric, but just a tiny spot. It is irritating to put together. I would only try it with two people. My husband and I had a hard time getting everything just right, but now it has held up for 4 months. My puppies seem to prefer a blanket on it. They like for things to be soft and the fabric is a bit course. One of them sleeps on it almost every day, but the other one just lays on it to play with toys. Overall, I think that it isn't bad for dogs that are not destructive, but I would have expected something more sturdy and well built for the cost.",cats,2

"We have been using these C&S; Suet cakes for about three our four years now. We have ten to twelve suet baskets installed around and near our house; most in plan view, others rather hidden. Living in the middle of an isolated woodland area with many trees and much brush gives the birds plenty of room to establish their own territory.We use the C&S; brand first because the birds like the stuff. Of the many ""flavors"" they offer, we have not found one that the birds reject to any extent. I have watched rather closely and cannot tell a significant difference. Perhaps others may have a different experience and different observations. Secondly, this product can be used year round. It does not melt when the weather is hot, and we do have some hanging in the direct sun. Third, they do not seem to attract the insects that some brands do, nor to that have a bad odor, and fourth, the price of this product is extremely competitive compared to other brands. To be quite frank, I have tried many of the more expensive brands and cannot tell one bit of difference in them and the C&S; brand. I might add that it is always available at local stores in our area which make it rather convenient.We use the C&S; holders and personally prefer the front loaders, i.e. the ones that have tension clips on the top and swing down. We have our holders mounted on trees in a solid fashion at various heights. We do use small staples to permanently attach the basket to the tree as we have found that once in a while raccoons will try to take the entire basket to where ever raccoons take things. C&S; dose make a variety of suet baskets and a person needs to figure out which works the best in their particular situation.We also use the baskets with the coated wider (no rust) and the smaller holes, as this seems to cut down on rodent pilferage...although I do not begrudges an occasional furry critter having a quick meal.These cakes are primarily used by birds of the woodpecker tribe although, especially in the winder, we do have other species use them. We have a rather large woodpecker population near and around us.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",birds,0

This is a good undercoat removal tool but it is my opinion it does little to reduce loss of top coat hair which is the main problem with our Black Lab. Also be very careful not to use it too much as I would wager over use is not too good for your dog. I only use it once a week and am very careful not to over do it. It is very expensive and I really prefer the Zoom Groom's softer application.,cats,2
"This is a great product. The litter locker is wonderful in that my hands never have to touch cat pee or poop again and my nose rarely if ever has to be insulted by the rancid nastiness that is cat excrement. SO I love the product. I have two glorious cats. These refills last about 3 weeks. SO that's great too. That I can get 5 at a time is nice as well. The instructions are very easy to understand and are printed right on the units. But if you have a litter locker, you already know how easy it is. I heartily recommend this product.I call this the razor blades of cat poop for obvious reasons",cats,2
"I like this product and I think the price is great on Amazon. I think I paid $20 less than I would have at the pet store. The machine is not too loud and easy to set up and get going. Not sure how often I will change the filter (I think that's how they try to make their money) but I really only bought it to have moving water for the cats, not filtered.As for my cats, they were very interested in watching the fountain action but scared to drink for a few hours. Finally they got into it and 2-3 weeks later they seem to be fine with it.",cats,2

"The Elite LitterMaid is definitely a big step backward from the last model. We owned a LitterMaid for about 5 years, and loved it. We had a few minor issues with it, but overall it worked pretty good. It wore out a couple months ago. I saw the ""new and improved"" LitterMaid Elite model, and I thought the new design looked good. It was more expensive than the older model, but I figured that was because of its new and improved design, and it would be worth the extra cost. Well, with the very first use I didn't like it. The motor is very loud--quite a bit louder than the older model. And after two months of trying to get it to work by adjusting the litter level like some other reviewers recommended, I am ready to throw it out. It simply does not work. It's really disgusting--rather than scooping and dumping, it smashes and smears, jams and spills. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MODEL. I'll buy the older model if I can find it, or I will go back to the old-fashioned ""do it yourself"" scooping.If the rating system would have allowed me to give it ""No Stars"", that's the rating I would have given it. One star is too good for this hunk of junk.",cats,2

We love the removal of the lid too, so you can put the whole bag of dog food in, still in bag if want...Worth the money. We are now going to buy this small one for cat food. Love the Rubbermaid Pet food container-solid, well made and keeps the food fresh-and looks nicer than most-and a scoop to boot!",dogs,3
"This harness is perfect for a free-spirited, rescued Yorkie-poo. He was left on the back porch of our church and this harness just further convinces him that, in coming home with us, he has indeed won the doggie powerball!

"We have 2 cats and are extremely busy so we thought this product would be a good thing for us. While my initial impression was good, I have since decided I will be getting rid of it and going either with another brand or back to a standard litter box.When you first replace the litter box, it works ok for a few days with low odor, and yes it scoops the poop, however...The major issue I have is that somehow our cats have figured out a way to pee into this thing in a way that lets urine get underneath the box itself. And before you ask, ""Are you sure it's put together right"" let me just say that YES it is put together right. The product simply leaks. I'm not using it for more than 10-14 days for the 2 cats. I even stir the litter.During this time it simply reeks urine smell for the latter half of it's life. Sorry, crystal litter simply doesn't do the job of completely getting rid of that odor. The idea that this product would actually work for a long period of time is a pipe dream.To top it off, they charge you $16 for something that should cost $6. Even the product itself has got a basic motor and is made of plastic and they charge a heap for it. All I can say is this company is making a killing on selling utter crap. I only hope this review helps someone out there who was thinking of buying this to stop themselves before making the same mistake.Unless you want to spend something like $30-60/mth on cat litter and an overpriced initial investment, I'd like to tell you all to pass on this one.",cats,2
"My cat is a therapy cat and I am handicapped. I have to be in sitting position most of the time and have tried many toys to keep him entertained but this absolutely blew me away.I have just about ever toy in the house you can think of and he has little or not interest in most of them. I have searched everywhere for something to give him some enthusiasm.Well, Da Bird changed all that. I have never seen him so feral. His eyes get huge and he just goes crazy. Our play session lasts about 20 minutes and it just wears him out. I've never seen him jump so high or be so captivated by anything such as he is this. And it seems to be well constructed. It's holding up well thus far though he is a large guy who tends to break things easily. We still have the original bird attachment in flight now.It's great therapy for both of us. I could not be more pleased with this. This has to be the best cat toy I have ever gotten. I got the super pack too with several attachments and that should keep him very busy for quite some time to come. This is great enrichment for any cat.",cats,2

"Our one year old westie can chew up almost anything. I've spent lots of money on toys that were made for aggressive chewers, and were destroyed 20 minutes later. This treat dispenser is great. We've had it several months and it's still in excellent condition. I read reviews before purchasing, and bought the larger size because it had a rope instead of a plastic piece. I definitely recommend the rope. I was afraid the larger size would be too big, but Max loves it. He weighs 15 lbs.",dogs,3
These two leashes are so we can keep a pair in the car so when we take the dogs someplace don't discover we left their leashes at home.

Be aware there are different sizes/types/colors.,dogs,3
"I installed the system around the perimeter of my 2.5 acre lot. It took about 5 hours to install. I have a metal pipe fence, so I didn't bury the wire around the perimeter, I just wrapped it around the bottom pipe of the fence and it has worked very well. training was a breeze. I lead my lab to the fence on a lease and let her get zapped once and she has only gotten zapped once more, when she ran out to meet an incoming automobile at the gate. I would highly recommend this product.",dogs,3
"After trying all the tricks to control incessant barking (exercise, attention and love, distraction), I finally resorted to this collar. One week ago today, I put it on the dog, a coonhound nearing 1 year of age with a big bark and coon whine. On the first day, I stayed out of doors with her for the first few hours. Yes she barked once, then a little yelp, then I verbally corrected her ""Quiet"". She did this 5 more times, same thing. Then the big bark, bark, bark--she stopped looked dismayed and took herself to her crate (which is always open--her ""safe"" place). She didn't bark again the rest of the day. Nine barks and she was done. I put the collar on her for 12 hours at a time, 4 days in a row. No more barking. She runs, chases the birds (when she'd get into the incessant barking), watches the neighborhood children and walkers (also a barking cue)--but no barking. Now all our interactions are positive ones--lots more petting time, praising time, treats and other good things. On day 5, 6 and today, I have not put the collar on and she seems to be over her barking fits. She's completely playful and friendly. I have continued to exercise this dog daily not depending on the collar to be the entire solution. By the way, I did try out the collar on my thigh and it is much like a static shock. I am now more ashamed of the continuous verbal reprimands that I gave my dog over the months than I am of the collar that corrected her nine times. There are no skin issues on my dogs neck from these shocks. I agree with other comments that the collar itself is thin and cheap--but I had a back up one to replace it if necessary. I am grateful for this tool to restore happiness to our household.",dogs,3
"This price is cheaper than the price at petco! I use this shampoo for my rabbit who has an problem, she urinates on herself. This shampoo does such a great job.

They aren't falling apart enough that it's a problem. I'd still buy more when these fell apart. Good price, well loved by kittehs. :)",cats,2

"I, like many others, over past 2 years have spent oodles on my toy poodles skin allergy at the veterinarian. Prednisone worked but it would come right back within a week. He would get the worst patches of almost blood red areas and loose his hair from scratching so much at it, whether it is fleas, grass or whatever allergy, veterinarians do not know. But I searched dog skin allergy in my search engine and found Great Dane Lady website [...] and she had some information on this product and foods to try to help yeast skin allergies. After 6 months on good hypoallergenic food with no help, so wasn't food allergy so tried Micro-Tek products and to my great surprise after one wash, his areas returned to normal and no scratching!!!!! I wash him once a week with Micro-Tek shampoo leave on 5 min. and use the Micro-Tek spray on areas after drying and between washings. Miracle indeed!!!! So try this product first before changing food with your pet, because hypoallergenic food is expensive. Amazon has Micro-Tek products the cheapest also with free shipping over $25 spending.Thank You Amazon.com. I am a happy customer!",cats,2

"This toy lasted about ten minutes. First one i purchased had a rope tug, which my pup quickly chewed through, rendering the toy useless. I bought another one after i saw that they had changed the rope portion to a rubberized ""rope"" and it seemed like a better solution. Wrong! The rubber rope took my dog (who is not much of a chewer) about two minutes to completely chew into small pieces, again leaving her with nothing but a purple plastic jug. Product is a great idea if they can figure out what will work better as the ""tug"" mechanism, but as is (both versions) are just poorly made and a waste of $$$$.",dogs,3
"We have 2 inside cats at our house, a male and a female. We have an older female cat that doesn't get along with other females, so when this female stray showed up at our house, we tried to find another home for it. When those efforts failed and with cold weather on the way, we decided to make a home for her in our garage. After installing a pet door, using this mat, we made her a heated bed. In addition to the mat, we use a 75-wat incandescent bulb to warm the space above the bed. We keep food and water out there for her as well (in addition to getting her spayed and immunized). Despite the manufactures warning about placing blankets directly on the mat, we do cover the mat with a thin blanket and see no issues with doing so. The mat does a good job of warming the bed and the cat uses the bed daily. She's a really nice cat and when our older inside female decides to go to cat heaven, we will surely bring her into the house.",bunny rabbit central,1
"Thanks a lot, Treat-Umms. Before we discovered your product, we used to sleep in, say, to 7:30 AM or so. Since we have been giving our 6 dogs (5 chihuahuas and a Japanese Chin) Chicken & Sweet Potato Wraps as a morning treat, they have trained us to get up at 5:30 every morning, or earlier, to get their little mouths wrapped around one of these wraps. They are relentless. And of course, being fairly intelligent and trainable, we have complied with their wishes completely.

I have had this product for a about a month and so far so good. The audible mode is a bit annoying if you are around. But if you want something to stop your dog from barking when you're out it works really well. FYI- my dog is very sensitive to high pitched sounds so its effects on other dogs I am unsure of. If your dog hides from a smoke detector it probably would work well as mine does. I would not recommend leaving it on when you are home because any sufficiently loud sound will set it off. It also works for loud yelping. I recommend not using the inaudible mode because you will never actually know when its going off unless you are watching your dog.,dogs,3
"Couple tips for anyone planning on installing the fence themselves.-Rent a cable trencher from the hardware store. They are made specifically to bury cable into the ground.The one I rented worked very well and I was able to get 500ft of cable done in about 3 hours (finishing touches took about another hour).-Don't use the wire that comes with the kit. I found the insulation very thin and was obvious cost saving part of the kit.The hardware store in my area sold spools of ""Pet Containment"" wire in the electrical section. It is probably 5x thicker insulation and worked very well with the trencher.-If your yard has lots of clay make sure to wet down the path you plan to take before using the trencher. Using it on damp soil seemed to work the best.-Use something to mark the straightaway's. I found that it was hard to keep the trencher going straight unless I had something to follow. I used my garden hose and followed next to that with the machine.-Plan to have some extra soil handy to fill in spots as needed. I needed to fill in pretty much the entire length of the trench to make sure the wire stayed in place.Good luck!",dogs,3

I've had these boxes for years (I replace them yearly for sanitary purposes). I think they're great but they do get messy. The cats still have a tendency to go right underneath the opening which has them stepping in/out the messed area. The one star drop however is because my small dogs have finally figured out how to get in. Granted it took them years to figure it out and they were defeated by my placing the boxes behind a gate. But then again - I could've put any boxes behind a gate and my cats could've used the whole open space more easily.,cats,2

"These pellets are the EXACT same as ""equine (horse) bedding"", and similar to wood pellets for pellet stoves. You can buy a 40 (yes, forty!) pound bag of equine pellet bedding for only $6!!! (vs $10 for 20 pounds of Feline Pine!) I purchase at my local farm/tractor store. Wood stove pellets are even less - can get 40 pounds as cheap as $4. I called the manufacture of one wood pellet stove product and they told me it is totally safe for pets...no chemicals used in production, and made from PINE, etc. However, some wood pellet stove are made from hardwoods (not pine) and this would not be as absorbent so you need to double check on the type of wood stove pellets. I'd stick with equine bedding...it is pine and made for animals.I do love this type of litter! No dust. Absorbs and masks odor better than any other litter. After using this type of litter for a couple years, I am pretty ""skilled"" at being able to scoop out mostly only the sawdust, and leave the intact pellets behind. My cats usually pee in the corners so that is where most of the sawdust is. Also, if you shake the box, sawdust drops to bottom and you can scrape intact pellets to the side and scoop the sawdust underneath out. If you don't pay attention when you scoop and are not tedious with a ""method"" like me, you will likely also scoop out a lot of the intact pellets too and thus waste a lot of it. We went out of town for 2 weeks, and our cat sitter used DOUBLE the amount of litter we use!For the star rating - I'd actually give 5 stars for this pine pellet type of litter. But I am giving one star because of the ridiculous price charged by Feline Pine!!",cats,2

"I bought this with the interest of moving water. My cat seems to only like to drink fresh moving water. Before this fountain I left the sink on a trickle so he would drink. Cats don't like ""stale"" water (as I was told by my vet). The fountain was noisy at first but once it started cycling it went quiet and the sound of the moving water was actually soothing. Then I got a dachshund. She drinks a lot because she plays a lot and when the bowl is only half full the fountain becomes noisy. I'm always pouring a cup of water back into it which I don't mind, I just hate how noisy it gets, you can hear it all over the house.The reason I dislike it now is it is very hard to clean. The back part where the filter goes has a lot of tiny spaces and corners and my hand doesn't fit inside. I stick it in the dishwasher but there is still a slimy feel to the inside because it needs to be scrubbed. I bought little bottle brush scrubbers but those don't get the corners too well. This thing is just a pain to clean. I live in a place with very hard and mineral filled water. The plastic design for this is not a good idea. Once a week when I clean the whole thing I have to take a steak knife and scratch off all the white hard build up (and its hard to see because of the colour of the fountain, but I can feel it.)Overall it's a nice little fountain, it just gets a little noisy when it needs to be refilled and is a pain to clean.",cats,2

"This item is awesome. We've been using it to keep our kittens off of the kitchen counter when we're away. People have been telling us that you can't train kittens -- they are wrong.First off, the only reason I gave this item 4 stars is that it uses (4x) AAA batteries and does not have a DC plug-in port. The miniscarecrow seems to blow through these in a little over a month of all-day-everyday use.That said, the motion sensor works well and is tuned perfectly (for a cat size object). It's neither too sensitive nor too slow. We set ours up on the counter (out-of-site) pointing across the length of the counter.... no more ""transgressions"".As an additional bonus, this things works *outstanding* on humans too (as a prank to scare them). Come Halloween, I'm going to have some fun!Last bit....the spray is truly non toxic and non-harmful. Having triggerred it myself numerous times (forgot it was on) and take a blast right to the face.

"Bought this about 2 weeks ago, not from amazon. It works at all the wrong times. It has never once corrected my dog for barking. It has corrected my neighbors dogs, and made a correction when my dog scratched herself. The thing makes an audible beep, which is more annoying to humans than dogs. Their ears perk up and they carry about their business. The collar is way too long for my dog and her existing collar would be too thick to add the device to. The worst part for me is that Petco's return policy does not allow you to return opened items. Unfortunately the boxing, likely to prevent theft (save your time thieves this is not worth it) makes it impossible to open the box and try the device without ripping the outer box and the plastic. Now I will be extremely unlikely to charm my way into getting a refund for my $60. So my advice, don't buy this at all, but if you succumb to temptation, check the return policy first.",dogs,3

We used to have to bring separate bowls, bag of dog food, bag of treats. this makes it so easy. We even tend to use the main food container as storage around the house to keep her food fresh. I will say though that the food storage isn't that big. If you have a large dog (ours is an 8 lb. yorkie-poo) this probably won't be the greatest for you as your dog will probably eat more food in a couple day than this thing can hold. For us though it certainly can last a long week maybe a little more. It's also great for when we have people dog sit for us.

"I purchased this gate to keep the dog downstairs, off the carpet, while still allowing the cats free reign. Originally, I had wanted it at the top of the stairs, but it turned out the cat door was big enough for my 20 pound beagle as well. So we positioned it in front of a stair just right, so that the opening was about cut in half and the cats could still slink through. Works great, and i absolutely love having a door for myself as well instead of having to climb over the old gate we had. It's definitely worth the money, though I wish the cat door were not so big, or at least had a smaller door option available.",dogs,3

"I luckily got this product from a pet supply distributor I deal with to try for free. I am in the pet care industry and have tried pretty much every type of litter out there. I usually use my personal cats as test-dummies for new products and had high but reasonable hopes for World's Best Scoopable Multi-Cat Litter... So I do a full litter box clean out, scrub the box and add several inches of litter to the box; the smell was 'off' to begin with but I figured I'd give it a try. Five hours later my husband comes home, uses the bathroom and tells me he thinks I need to clean the cat box... he's in disbelief when I tell him I just put brand new litter in the box. The litter lasted less than a week in my house, one of my three cats started urinating and defecating on the bathroom floor the first night the litter was in use and I finally couldn't stand dealing with it anymore, cleaning up accidents & the smell throughout my house, of this nasty litter.I scoop the litter box daily, I absolutely loved the clumping of this litter, it was pretty much dust-free, and the product seemed to last & last unlike regular clay litters that must be replenished often... Why oh Why must it smell so horrible? My cats will use ANY box with ANY litter as long as it is clean, BUT WBCL is an absolute waste when your cat won't even use it!",cats,2

"I bought this product on the advice of a puppy training group member who said she wouldn't be without it. I agree. I have a torn rotator cuff and this system allows me to walk my dog without using my arms. It is very well designed so that you can attach and detach it easily, use it as a regular leash, adjust the size of the belt and the length of the leash. I am sure runners would love it and anyone who wants to have both hands free while walking the dog. It is sturdy and of good quality.",dogs,3
"I absolutely LOVE my ScoopFree litter box!! One of the best inventions ever! Less mess, less work & less dust!! I have 2 of them & have had them for over a year now & no issues except for 1 kinda big one - the refill cartidgesThe refill cartridges last 1 month & are slightly costly ($15.99 each)especially if you have multiple cats. But about 2 months ago the refill cartridges disappeared from local pet store shelves. We were told there was a back log & distribution issue & they should be on store shelves by the 1st week in August. It never happened. I just bought the last 2 refill cartridges at the Meier by me 2 days ago. When I contacted ScoopFree today about their distribution issue over the past couple months they called me & informed me that Petsmart refused to place any orders with them the past 4 weeks & it was just decided this week (By Petsmart) that they will no longer carry ScoopFree's refill cartridges on their shelves. Their product is available at Meier, Petco or Pet Supplies Plus (which are more expensive) or I could subscribe to their delivery service & have packs of 3 or 6 delivered at a time with free shipping. I had already found my alternative!! FOREVER LITTER TRAYS!! Which are sold here on Amazon.com! [...] In the long run these will save you a ton of money & they are getting excellent reviews! I recommend using Target brand crystal litter as a refill filler option.I'm using litter box liners to line my ScoopFree refill cartridge & make them last until I can get my Forever Trays! Then I'll write another review for those!",cats,2

"I was a real fan of this line of dog treats until one day, I noticed on the back of the bag, the fine print, that read, ""MADE IN CHINA"". How can a dog treat that states cage free chickens and all natural come from China? Its rare to hear of a cage free chicken coup in China of all places. And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least. I have since found better alternatives that I can be more comfortable in giving my dog, such as Plato Natural Organic Chicken made here in the USA.",dogs,3
"What a great gate. The installation was very easy, and did not take much time. Very sturdy, and excellent build materials, high quality plastic. Only wish that there was a way to lock the gate open so that I didn't have to keep pushing it back every time I walk by it when I'm not using it.",dogs,3

"I wish I had read the previous reviews before I had spent $$$ on this litterbox. The concept was good, and I liked that it was larger than the largest Littermaid box, but the engineering was poor and every element of the box was broken and useless within two months of use by two adult cats. I ended up throwing it away. $150 plus accessories in the trash. What a shame. There has to be a better system somewhere!",cats,2
My dogs are loving this product. They chow down their food quickly and don't leave any kibbles for the next guy. One even wakes up early to be fed now. Only downside --- stinky fish dog breath kisses!,dogs,3
"When my 11 year old female Cocker Spaniel was diagnosed with kidney disease we did research and looked for a supplement to help support her kidneys. Having found this we thought we'd give it a try. So far she's on her second bottle now and we feel it's helped keep her numbers stable, just a tad above normal but not critical. Considering her diet's not that ideal even, this has proven quite effective in maintaining her kidney health. She just turned 12 and she's doing fine. For her size this is quite economical to use, just a cap/day. Though take note the caps are on the large side and uncoated. So we like crushing this and mixing in her food. We also give her salmon oil together with this because we read this is an effective combination, and as I've written, seems to be working for her. So don't hesitate to try this on any of your dogs that may need it, it's helped us so far.",dogs,3

I buy 3-6 jars at a time from With six cats (never again), we go through too many jars to pay retail.",cats,2

Betta fish always need a heater. This heater works great for bowls or small tanks from 2.5g to 5g. I had it on all winter and the temperature was pretty stable. I will have to turn it off during the summer since it doesn't do it automatically. But it is still a great solution if you have a bowl or a small tank.

"I had the misfortune of purchasing this collar. This collar is a disaster for a few reasons. First, the collar does not stay in place over the voice box. Because of the rigidity and shape of the collar and the fact that the heavy buckle is on the side of the collar, the collar will ride up and sit on the side of the dogs neck rendering it useless. Second, even when it is positioned correctly, it doesn't work. Perhaps it is the battery (which I replaced twice) or internally it is broken. Either way, stay away from this mess of a product. Petsafe should be ashamed of the poor quality.",dogs,3
"Simply put, this is the best poop scooper I have ever used. So simple. I was worried that it wouldn't get underneath the poop enough to scoop it up cleanly but it does. The handle could be a little longer, but it's not like it's so short I have to bend over.",dogs,3
"The replacement flap arrived on time and seemed fine. I didn't open it as the picture shown on the box did not show the four screws visible at the top of my pet door. As a renter, I didn't know what kind of a door I had. I called PetSafe and a rep asked me a few questions and told me I had a Freedom door. I found one locally, which looked like it would be perfect -- it wasn't.I called one more time and this rep asked me several more questions, including if the screws at the top of my plastic frame door were evenly spaced and if the panel to close off the door slid down from the top (and if my door was flexible, not rigid). I answered yes to all her questions and was told I have a Quick Fit door. UGH. If I had this to do over again, I would call the company and describe the door in detail BEFORE making any purchase for a replacement flap. Hopefully three will be a charm. Wishing you better luck!",cats,2
"Very quiet operstion and easy to install. Adjustable water flow is a great feature. Price is about $6.00 less than local pet stores and no tax. Only potential negative feature is that on larger tanks with thicker frames you will have to use the suction cups to hold it in place and over time these cups will fail. I would have preferred a hanger to fit thicker frame tanks. Other than that, I would recoommend this product.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I have bought a lot of coats and sweaters for my dogs and these are the best so far. The material is the perfect weight for our cold, but not freezing, nights (38-42 degrees). My dogs leave them on and actually come right up to get them put on at night. Every other coat, my one dog sheds off as fast as she can. The outside fabric keeps the wind off, while the inside is soft. It appears to be ""cheap"", but I think that the light weight is deceiving. They are holding up very well, are very easy to put on and take off, and the dogs seem warm and comfortable. Overall an excellent value.",dogs,3
"Unless you have a compliant dog, these boots are rather difficult to get on. More so, if you have a long haired dog because of the necessary snug fit, so that they will stay on. However, I found it very much worth the effort. Once on, the boots were great, especially since he was willing to walk in them. I could not have been happier. Coupled with his Hurtta Overalls, the only body parts that required drying off were his tail and head and it was raining pretty hard.",dogs,3
"Is a poopy scooper just a poopy scooper? Apparently not. Over the last few years we have tried several and they lasted less than a year. Springs would brake, plastic handles would break, many would hurt your hands just using them.I saw my neighbor using his and he never seemed to have a problem, at least the problems we were having. This scooper saves time, energy, wear and tear on yourself, and is clearly the way to go when it comes to your pet. This terrible job will seem to be a fresh breeze compared to others.",dogs,3
"I have four cats and we clean out the litter boxes at least once a day. I have used this litter for a few months and I am not happy with it. The odor control does not exist. I almost want to puke when I clean out the boxes. The price is not even worthy of it's performance, lumps break down and cause a permanent stench. And it tracks worse than Feline Pine. I am going back to Feline Pine because of it's superior odor control. I also had people comment on the bad odor since I changed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",cats,2

"I can't really complain about the product. I bought them for a little over $2.00 each. Other reviews were a bit harsh. Think about it. If you are paying under $3.00 for a stainless bowl, of course it is not going to be heavy. If you are complaining about the stickers, well then soak them in hot water and Dawn dish soap.Like I said, I paid a little over $2.00 each. I bought 6. I really can't complain. For the price, I got what I should. If I wanted a high quality, heavier bowl, then obviously I would have paid more.",dogs,3

"This product has managed to keep my 85 lb male German Shepherd off the couch. He's 8 years old and had always been given couch privileges, but he had ruined one couch and so we got a new one. At first we let him on the new couch, but then we noticed that the fabric was starting to be torn and shredded (not purposely, just the result of him climbing on and off). At first we just put boxes on the couch. That was a pain because we had to move them every time we wanted to sit down (and remember to put them back). After six months of this, he would still get on the couch if he had the opportunity.This device cured him of the problem quickly. I tested the shock on myself and while it is unpleasant, it's not going to cause lasting harm. I was hoping that a few weeks of wearing the collar would work, but he is smart enough to know that if he isn't wearing the collar that he can get on the couch painlessly.The only issue I have had is that the batteries are sort of loose in the main unit. I ended up wrapping a rubber band around the batteries and their contacts to make it stay on.",dogs,3

"I bought this unit as it was exactly what I needed for my pond. It worked great the first year. Luckily I was able to have Farm Innovators replace it under warranty as it was just within the 1 year period. Again, same thing, the replacement unit worked great the first year but some how got water in it(like the first one), now it melted through the bottom of the unit and is useless. I did not submerge the unit as it floats on top of the water but it appears that the seal around the plug cord going into the unit is poor and lets water seep in....luckily I have a small pump circulating the water that keeps a small opening in the ice so the fish are still swimming. I have to look for different unit for the real cold weather, what a disappointment.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I bought this to try to control my neighbors neglected dog that is left outside most of the day, and barks at anyone, or anything that it hears, or sees throughout the day including my family whenever we're in our backyard.As stated in another review this unit looks as if it has 4 speakers, but actually only the bottom 2 speakers work, the other 2 must have been put there to make the unit look more powerful than their lower priced model the Lentek Bark Free Pro, but in all reality as stated on the Lentek web page, the lower priced Lentek Bark Free Pro model actually has a larger coverage area.The description on Amazon and many other sites say it has a 50ft range, but the mfg says it will only cover up to 20 ft.It will detect a bark from 50', but if it's coverage area is only 20' so what good is that?.http://www.lentek.com/Main/Main.asp?SubCategoryID=31&CategoryID;=8&As for the product itself, I'm using it through a 6' stockade fence which the mfg doesn't reccomend, but I have the speakers placed so that they let the sound go through the spaces between the slats(I hung it sidways).I did notice at first the dog was startled by the sound, but I'm begining to think she's getting used to it, as she's back to my side of the yard again, and doesn't really seem to get bothered when the thing goes off.It has been a little more quiet throughout the day when we are inside so the boredom barking has gone down a little, so I will give the unit credit for that.I paid 48.00 shipped, it comes with a 50' power cord, and will also uses 4 d batteries.Not many positive reviews to be found on any of theese ultrasonic bark deterrents, but the fake speaker thing, and the lower coverage range makes me wonder about this company.One would think that coverage would be an important feature.I guess Lentek knows most people looking at theese products are in dire need of a resolution so they add ""Super"" + 20 bucks, and make it look more technically advanced, thinking that desperate people will jump on it,just like myself.For 25 dollars I'd have no problem keeping this unit, but for 50 I'll see how it goes, and maybe return.I only give it 2 stars because the mfgs attempt at misleading consumers, otherwise I'd give it 3 since it does seem to work a little.Not exactly as good as I hoped, but even a little is something.I have seen a few positive reviews for the bird house unit, so if I return this one I will give that one a shot, even though it's a few more dollars.",dogs,3

They send me a shipping label for the return but in the meantime my husband got rid of the packaging, so I decided to keep it. Customer service and the product is great.

"First off, it's so simple to get it up and running.It came nicely packaged, all parts were there and the instructions were so easy to follow.I put it all together and filled the reservoir with water and plugged it in. As soon as the water started flowing, my cat, who's about 2 years old, came over and started batting at the trickling water. It took her no time at all to start using it. It has a low humming sound mixed with the tranquil sound of trickling water. Not noisy at all. I do suggest getting a water-proof mat to place under it in case your kitty or puppy like to splash around or bat at the falling water. I highly recommend this... it's a great investment and considering all the trips to and from the faucet to refill the water dish.. Some times I might not be home in time to fill it if it runs out, but this hold A LOT of water!(Regarding the parts and assembly) -- I mean, there are no small parts or tools required, I was referring to the filter, the main dish portion, the reservoir and power cable.",cats,2

"Our 7 month McMab (worker breed) is not a bad walker, nor does she pull with too much force. However, she goes crazy when she sees other dogs that are walking near us. We thought the Gentle leader would help with her high and uncontrollable energy. Although it does give us control in these situations, the poor design outweighs this. The first time we used this on her, I thought, wow.. This is a magical collar! She did paw at it quite a bit, but I figured she would eventually stop after a few days or weeks as advertised. Weeks later, and a few dozen tightness adjustments, she is not only pawing at it, but I started to notice some chaffing on her muzzle. The DVD says, ""If you think it's too tight, its probably just right."" No matter how tight I made it, the head collar would rotate, which would cause the nose strap to rub against her muzzle, causing it to irritate. The DVD also said to make it tight enough so that it won't rotate, but the tighter I made it, I noticed her breathing sounded funny. I also made sure that it rested above her adams apple and it still affected her breathing. I then tried to loosen the nose strap more. This just resulted in the strap covering her eyes during her walk. We must have tried adjusting this thing about 30 times and still couldn't get the thing to stop rotating and irritating her muzzle. The nose strap is supposed to be somewhat loose, but becomes uncomfortably tight when the main collar rotates. We finally concluded that the design was not meant for this particular dog.After doing some more research, I found Comfort Trainer Head Halter. After reading about it, I decided to order one. I just received it in the mail today and man, what a difference! Now, I know I just got it, but there are no precise adjustments to be made and no rotating. It took just a few minutes to adjust and fit. It is also made with a softer material. You will pay extra for this, but the quality and design is much better.The Good",dogs,3
My cats started playing with this as soon as I put it down. They love it. It's one of their top five toys. It will also last a long time.,cats,2

"Pretty pricy for a piece of plastic! Each web site had a slightly different size listed for this model # of door flap & even within the same ad there were several discrepancies in the measurements. After measuring my door numerous times (even removing the door to make sure I had accurate numbers) I felt this was the correct flap. Mine did not have the brand name on it but after reviewing the sizes available for sale I was sure this had to be the one. It fit well except it was 1/4'"" short. If you run into this problem you might try what I did, which was to remove the bottom rail, drill new screw holes "" up & reattach the bottom rail to meet the bottom edge of the flap. Otherwise it is the same quality of an original ""Petsafe"" flap which seems to last about 3-4 years. I currently have installed in my home one ""petsafe"" model for a sliding patio door & 2 other generic doggie doors. All flaps seem to warp leak or tear after about 3-4 years.",cats,2
"We are a 5 cat household and there is no shortage of cat fur during those periods of the year when cats shed most. Our cats are indoor cats, so grooming is extra important to help them avoid hairballs (since they won't get all the grass and roughage inside as they would outside).I have tried MANY different de-shedding tools out there and spent a small fortune on de-shedding wipes, cat food that helps eliminates hairballs and other brushes and de-shedding gloves. Nothing ... I mean NOTHING works as well as this Furminator. The cats love it and so do we! We got the small one and this provides great coverage for cats.Please note that the Furminator is not good on cats that might have knots in their fur (a long-haired cat or outdoor cat). You'll want to be careful that there are no knots in your kitty's fur to ensure a comfortable experience.The Furminator is amazing! Get one and watch the fur begin to disappear around your house.",cats,2

"I bought these about a month ago because we have a few cats that we occasionally have to give pills. It worked for 2 of the cats but the other seemed to sense that something was ""fishy"" about these things and wouldn't touch them. But for the other two cats they worked great.They are like a semi-moist cat food, but more moist and pliable. There's a little indentation in the middle and you just push the pill inside and squeeze it together. The cats seem to pretty much swallow it whole, or if they do chew it, don't notice the pill inside. If it were a very bitter pill I probably wouldn't use these since they'd probably be able to taste it. Anything that gets medication down even 2 of the cats without a struggle is a success as far as I'm concerned.",cats,2
"This filter is extremely quiet. Mixing media types is a snap because of the stacked basket design. Cleaning filter is simple, and the lift tab to stop water flow through the hoses while cleaning is simply brilliant. The only problem I had at all during setup was installing the hoses onto the filter and tubes until I heated the hoses in boiling water. without heating I don't think they will actually install properly and you could break the fittings by trying to force them on.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I decided to go with the oral gel version of Viralys after having been using theVet Solutions Viralys (L-Lysine) Powder (100 grams)in food and as a paste that that my kitties can lap up whenever they start to sneeze. The Viralys really keeps respiratory issues contained and it's been a blessing. I decided that since my kitties are on a bit of a oral gel kick with new products likeNutri-Vet Pet-Ease Paw-Gel for Cats, 3-Ouncethat my kitties would love this format. The main issue is the consistency. The Nutri-vet Pet-Ease Paw gels are of such a consistency that they don't stick to the roof of the cat's mouth like peanut butter. I thought that they would have taken to it like they have the powder (and I like to keep Viralys on hand because it seems there is always one or two cats with the sniffles).I'm giving it four stars for my 6 cats own personal experiences and mine. I did find the tube a little messy (the stuff is not quite thick enough to stay on my fingers and drips like honey) and the consistency of the product is almost like honey. The smell of the Viralys gel is not that cat appealing fishy smell that comes from the powder and seems to attract my little furry friends but rather a sweeter smell. I am not saying the cats do not enjoy it, they just don't take to it like other products in tubes or the Viralys powder.Unless I see adaptive behaviors in my kitties where they really take to this, I will probably stick to the Viralys powder for the meantime and mix it in with their wet food or create a stand-a-lone paste with it. My cats seem to love that.",cats,2

"I have used a number of different products including the most popular brands on the market. Urine Off is the best odor remover I have found. When I apply it to a urine stain however, I put a piece of plastic over the stain after the Urine Off treatment and leave it there for a couple of days. I found that by doing this, the Urine Off has more time to work on the spot. I got a new Shih Tzu puppy and thought she was completely house broken. I was wrong and when the carpet in our exercise room started to smell, I took a black light to the carpet and found out why. After using the Urine Off the smell is gone.",dogs,3

"I have been using ""Missing Link"" for some time now and my cats are just the healthiest band of felines. I also home cook for them so they get the Missing Link, plus other necessary supplements and I couldn't be happier about the state of their health. I have two older cats (one over ten and a second one -- once a stray -- who is probably older than that) and they are in such great shape. I began feeding a little feral cat who's coat was a matte black. Once he began eating the right food, laced with the Missing Link, his matte black fur became silky and as shiny as a mirror. He's now an indoor cat and in excellent health! I'm so very pleased with this product and will never be without it as long as I have kitty critters in my life. Thanks for a wonderful product.",cats,2

"At first the vented screen became unseated, preventing the flow of clean litter and resulting in its being tossed into the drawer. Then the clips on the edges were sliding back, causing litter to leak on the floor when the unit was rolled over. In a few days those problems disappeared somehow. Maybe the plastic needed to be worked. For the last week, this litter igloo works very well. The kitty poop winds up in the narrow draw that fits well into the plastic tube newspaper bags we use for disposal. Our young cat adapted to a covered litter box very well. We remain impressed with this simple, but elegant device.",cats,2
"This item seems to work great. Our neighbor had loaned us his collar for our barking dog (15 lbs) and it was shock only. This 4 in 1 collar allows for vibration, shock, sound, and vibration before shock feature. The estimate arrival date was May 20th and I received it on May 1st. We have not tried letting the dog loose with the collar but from all indications this experience should go well as the vibration seems to be enough. Just be sure to have treats on hand as a re-enforcement for good behavior and you may need a lot of treats as this makes a rogue dog behave!",dogs,3
"I never want my cats to go through the misery of being without water. This automatic waterer lets me be sure they have water whenever they want it. Clean water.

And it's very easy to clean.I had invested in some of the electric-pump filtered water fountains, but my cats ignore those and go to their old faithful Bistro, so I'm unplugging the fountains and adding some more Bistro waterers around the house.",cats,2

"This toy is the best thing I have ever bought for Kane, my American Pit Bull Terrier.He is a little over a year old and this is the first toy to last more than 5 minutes with him. He absolutely LOVES it. I have to physically put it away, otherwise he won't stop playing with it. It's a great combo toy -- something you can throw, something you can tug, something that floats, and something your dog can chew on.It says that it is made of a puncture resistant material, but it does get tooth marks and scratches in it quite easily. However, when he gets tired of rolling it around on the ground, he will lay there and bite down with the full force of his bite over and over and over again like a baby sucking on a pacifier and it hasn't popped yet! This is the same dog that can deflate a basketball in mere seconds.I highly recommend this for those dog owners with aggressive and/or hard chewers (Kane can destroy even an EXTREME Kong in about two months and this Jolly Pet toy has lasted 5 months now). In terms of burning off energy, if you just let them chew it, I would say it's comparable to an hour-long session of hardcore fetch or a 3 hour hike, so it's great for those high energy dogs too! Kane is a really active dog (he gets two 3-mile hikes every day, plus 2 sessions of fetch and swimming time at our lake when I can manage it, and he is still raring to go), but he can play with this toy for 1/2 an hour and conk out for the next hour to two hours if I take it away. :)So, come one, come all, ye who own aggressive and/or hard chewers and/or highly active dogs.This is the toy for you!",dogs,3
"Think 9 times before trying this item out. If you make the mistake of disregarding what seems to be nearly universal negative reviews and shell out the $110 you'd better keep your receipt.

You'll have to scoop it or toss it.2- You'll notice poop and/or piddle collecting on and behind the rake.3- You'll notice poop marks on the housing of the unit, requiring cleaning.4- You'll be cleaning the unit and repacking it in the box to return it to the store.DON'T BUY IT!!!!!",cats,2

"If your dog ever get's skunked you want to have Skunk Off handy. The quicker you treat after the skunk sprays your dog, or you, the more effective the product. I had a young bird dog sprayed by a huge skunk in South Dakota. My buddy said ""Oh my gosh, we've got to smell that the rest of the week?"" When I got the dog back to the truck I put him on the tailgate, sprayed a heavy application of Skunk Off on the dog and thoroughly rubbed it in. By the time we got back to our hotel the buddy said, "" I don't believe it, you can barely smell it. I put a second application on and by the next morning the odor was very faint. I've used it several times and the stuff works. Remember the sooner after the skunking episode the more effective, use plenty. Keep a bottle handy - the 32 0z spray bottle is quite economical.",cats,2

"This toy appears to be well made, but gets pretty light use from my dog. There are three chipmunks (as another reviewer pointed out, not squirrels!) that fit into a plush trunk. Each chipmunk has a squeaker, and it seems like it can stand up to a moderate amount of abuse. My dog pulled the munks from their trunk a couple of times when we first got it, but now she's not very interested, except when I hide a treat in the trunk and make her dig for it.No reason not to try with your dog, especially if she loves squeaky plush toys. It's more expensive than pet-store squeakers, but it actually looks quite nice - more like a kid's toy than a dog's toy - lying around the house.",dogs,3
"Hi. I have used Frontline plus for years. This weekend. I had rescued a small breed puppy that was so flea infested that I get queasy thinking about it.I went to the vets and had her checked out and they told me it was safe to put Frontline plus for dogs under 22 pounds.I did. And, 48 hours later a big difference.I think people forget that fleas will still pop up on the dog but they don't last. It take 24 hours for the fleas to die. Also it acts like flea birth control that helps cut down on a flea infestation.Also, my vet reminded me, it is important to remember no bath 2 days prior to applying Frontline and 2 days after to bath time. Also if you don't use a mild doggie shampoo the product will not last as long. A more harsher not made for dogs shampoo will strip the product off the dog.I hate putting chemicals on my dogs and I know one of my dog reacts every time I put it on but she hasn't had any sort of visible skin reaction. So, I continue to use this product. It is important to remember it only works for 30 days. I always put it on the first garbage day of the month. :)I highly recommend this product.",dogs,3

Well, the Jolly Ball is still in one piece today and still his favorite toy. He carries it around by the holes and ""kicks"" it around with his feet all the time. We have even taken it to the river where it partially sinks and he dives for it. I HIGHLY reccomend this ball for any of the massive breeds. My corgi does not like the ball at all.",dogs,3

My chinchilla loves marble to sit on when it is warm - remember ideal temperatures are 60-80 degrees Farenheit for Chinchillas. The idea is great but you can go to a home supply store and buy a few tiles of marble for a fraction of this cost. Having an entire tile for them to sit on makes it ideal for two chinchillas. You can also place some marble where they jump if you happen to have some wire cage flooring as repeated jumping can injure the pads on their feet. Marble is usually easy to clean but be sure to replace them if their urine etches away at it.This is a great product for convenience but way overpriced.,fish aquatic pets,4
"We have 1 year old male Siberian Husky who is extremely energetic and easily excited. Our vet recommended using the Gentle Leader, at least for when we're in places with quite a few people and small animals (lol he wanted jump up and give everyone kisses and to eat the kittens they had in the office). And with all the raving about it I thought I'd give the gentle leader a shot. The one I bought (not from Amazon) came with a DVD discussing fitting it, dogs reactions to it and ways to reduce the reactions, and training techniques. The most difficult thing is getting the fit right. They tell you it needs to be tight enough you can only fit one finger under the strap that connects around the neck and even then, barely one. If needs to rest up near the base of the skull and be VERY tight. They're not kidding when they say you need to only be able to fit one finger under it to get the proper fit. If you even have it just a little loose, it will turn and the ring on the bottom will be on the side, lowering it's effectiveness and making your dog uncomfortable. The strap that goes over the nose, should be loose enough to stick a few fingers under it. The fit is VERY tight around the neck, to the point it looks uncomfortable to you, however with it tight like that it minimizes the discomfort to the dog.After you get the fit right, it's very effective. All in all, he seemed comfortable in it after he got used to it and I had it fitted right. I think it will work very good for more exciting places where I need a little bit more control like the vets, pet stores and social functions, but when I take him on hikes and out to play, I'm going to stick with the harness.",dogs,3
"These durable Nylabones seem to be somewhat less durable in the past couple years. I have an older Nylabone in the same flavor & size that my dog is still working at, and it's still in good shape. But I've purchased two more in the past year, in this and another flavor, and each time the pieces of plastic come away too easily & quickly. By 20 minutes into chewing, there are too many large pieces coming off, and I have to take it away. Swallowing this stuff is not good. I think Nylabone might be intentionally making these LESS durable so that we'll have to buy them more often, since the old ones lasted a lifetime.Also - note that this item is indeed the newer, textured version of the toy. I was hoping it wouldn't be, but I couldn't find it in this flavor and size in the untextured, and the description didn't mention it either way. My dog didn't seem to care either.As for all the Souper sized Nylabones, I wish they'd make the same thing just a bit longer in length. My dog is very tall but with a long narrow snout. He doesn't like anything that's too big to easily get in his mouth, like the ""big"" dog Nylabone toys. This toy is almost long enough for him to hold it well with his paws while chewing, but not quite.",dogs,3

"Our Jack Russell mix (about 35 pounds, 7 years old) has used both the hard cube toy and the Tricky Treat Ball. The cube is loud but it works great at keeping this type of dog busy. The Tricky Treat Ball just seemed to encourage her chewing it, as opposed to chasing it, to get the food.I was drawn in by the round shape that is much more quiet than the Buster cube. Our clever gal realized that chewing through the soft plastic would get her to the food much faster. And so the Tricky Treat ball was taken away and will be donated. She tried to chew it every time we gave it to her and so we determined that this wasn't a great option for this particular pup.The Buster Cube, being hard plastic and a somewhat awkward shape with no corners or traction for teeth, is better at encouraging destructo-dogs to roll, tip and nose it to get the food out.Great idea, but not for our pup.",dogs,3

"We've had a few different small animals and experimented with different cages and water bottles and have found this one to be the best by far. Small animals like gerbils and hamsters NEED to chew on stuff, and unfortunately it sometimes is their water bottle or other wire or plastic cages or toys. They need to be housed in an aquarium, first of all, so they cannot chew on the walls and latches, etc. We've owned plastic and wire cages in the past only to quickly replace them all with glass aquariums with a wire mesh top. That said, the only reasonable solution for the water bottle for the little fellas was this one because it's small, can be situated up high enough that they can't chew it, sticks on with double-sided tape, and is easily removed for filling. The other bottles we've had (many!) were all something that was bulky and hung down so far they would climb on them and chew on them. The glass one we had was fine until they chewed the whole cork off around the glass tube and we couldn't open it ever again. Gerbils in particular don't drink a lot, (and therefore don't pee a lot) so the bottle can be very tiny, which is why this one is perfect. The floating turtle inside makes it very easy to glance in and check the water level, too.",birds,0

"I have a 40 lb. sharpei/shepherd mix, who is getting much better about grooming but is still very unsure of new things. I've had her for a year and honestly it had been a little less than a year since I last brushed her, simply because the brush I had didn't work very well and I couldn't see the point. I've been keeping an eye out for something that I thought might work because she really does shed quite a lot, but she has very short hair and the products that I was seeing in the store either looked like they were tailor made for long-haired dogs who shed a lot or they looked like they would loosen but not necessarily catch my dogs short hair. My best friend told me about the furminator and honestly, its amazing. No matter how long your animal's coat is, you can expect that on the first use you are going to have a huge pile of hair to throw away. The best part is, she was so comfortable with it that she laid down and I brushed her for close to an hour. She is more comfortable, and I already notice a difference when I pet her and don't see a bunch of fur raining to the floor. I got the furminator model that does NOT have the furjector button, and honestly I don't think it matters much, I didn't find it inconvenient or anything to just pull the hair off, it honestly probably takes just as much time with the button as it does with your fingers. I would definitely also recommend buying this on amazon, just because the price is unbeatable, when I saw them at the stores I didn't see a single one for cheaper than $50, and I got mine for closer to $15 still in its original package. Great deal if you have a pet!",cats,2

"This is my favorite scratching post. It's not the ugly rope/carpet combo, so it's aesthetically pleasing rather than an eyesore. However... neither of my cats like it as much. I've had it for about four years or so, and it still looks practically brand new (whereas their rope-wrapped cat condo and other post are torn up and falling apart from scratching). I've moved this thing all over trying to find their favorite scratching spot, I've tried catnip and playing around it, but no dice. They just aren't into the woven sisal... they'll walk over to the rope posts instead. Every so often they'll scratch this, but I guess they just don't get as much pleasure out of it.So on the upside, it's tall enough for your cats to get a good stretch and scratch, if they actually like it. And it's the prettiest scratching post out there. I just wish my cats liked it more!",cats,2
"All I have to do is say ""Bonito"" and both my 10 month old kittens are beside themselves with excitement - apparently this treat is to them like double fudge peanut butter ice cream is to me. I heartily recommend this product. It's a little pricey but goes a looooong way and is totally worth it watching the kits eagerly chomp it down. One of my kittens will not have anything to do with any other kind of treat (she's pretty food fussy too) so it's nice to find something she likes so well.",cats,2
"**Update to my previous review. I recently took my cat off of this food. After 6 weeks on this food, she developed pancreatitis. This was in my non-diabetic cat. She had nothing else wrong with her, but pancreatitits. I was told that a high-fat diet can cause pancreatitis. After doing some research, I discovered that 58% of the calories in this food come from fat. It has a higher fat percentage than most grocery store cat foods! Is it a coincidence that my cat got pancreatitis after eating this food? Maybe. But she has never had it before. After barely eating for 2 weeks, hiding, not her usual self, and fearing that she would have to be hospitalized if she stopped eating entirely, I have decided to switch her to a lower fat food. I am unsure if I will continue to feed this to my diabetic cat.**I recently decided to switch my diabetic cat to this food from Purina DM canned food. The problem that I was having was that my diabetic cat would get into my other cat's food (Friskies). Also, I wanted to switch my other kitty to a healthier canned food. This product seemed more affordable than other high quality canned foods. I checked the fat/carb/protein content and discovered that it is almost identical to Purina DM. The carb content is slightly higher in the Wellness. If you have a diabetic cat, be sure you talk with your vet about your cat's insulin dosing before you make the switch to another food. My vet approved of this food for both my cats, suggesting that it is better nutritionally than both Friskies and even the DM.Both cats are thriving on this cat. My other cat who had lost weight due to a stressful move quickly regained the weight she had lost. And my diabetic cat is like a kitten again! She has become so much more high-energy and is really enjoying her play time more than she used to. There was a bit of vomiting from both cats during the transition, so make sure you followed the instructions for transitioning your cat to a new food. I am so glad that I found this food for my babies!",cats,2
"I shocked myself before putting this on the couch for the dog to make sure that it wasn't too much or.........maybe.....I did it to myself to ease my guilt for doing this to him. But this is not a therapy session for me or my dog, it's a review for this product. The shock itself was surprising more than anything else. So we commenced with the event. He jumped up almost immediately and started on one side of the couch quickly jumping all the way to the other side looking for a spot where this wasn't happening to him. He didn't find it and jumped off within 5 seconds. He never tried it again as far as we could tell. Talk about a Pavlov's dog. This worked. I sometimes forget to put it up again after we humans (the kind of animal that are permitted to get on the couch) have enjoyed its luxury and the dog does not even try to get up. Highly recommend.",dogs,3

"I just bought my 6 month old kitten these, just to try them out. She loves batting around paper balls and paper-clip type items so I was happy to find something that wasn't expensive and seemed something she would like. SHE LOVES THEM! It's been about 25 minutes and she is still batting it around, carrying it in her mouth and having her crazy kitten moments! It's the perfect cat toy. To big to swollow, quiet and durable, bright colors, cool shape and cheap! She is having a ball. It works on carpet or hardwood floors too!I also recommend the PetMate Crazy Spinners. She really enjoyed those also!",cats,2

"I bought this after seeing something similar at a friends house. They said they have had it for a few years. My dog is not much into playing with the tradition ropes or toys, but LOVES this... Only thing is, it seems to not hold up as well as I hoped (more the fault of my dog then the product). It may just be that my dog wants to tear into it and rip it to shreds, so we don't keep it out until we are going to play.I need to look at pricing out the material and maybe start making them myself, but the price was reasonable having it already braided.",dogs,3
I have several of these in an outdoor aviary keeping my birds warm while letting them sleep in the dark. So they aren't just for reptiles. Use them wherever you need some heat and no light.

"These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly ""indestructible"" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs. Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily! Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-) In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed",dogs,3

Our kitty needs to loose some pounds but she is very reluctant to play alone. But once I bought this toy I can hear her playing it several times during night.

"I bought this product to quiet our neighbor's dogs who bark viciously any time we go into our own backyard. I tried it out on my mom's border collie in the audible mode. I held the thing RIGHT in front of my mom's wildly barking dog and it made no sounds whatsoever- this is in the audible mode where it should emit a sound that humans can hear. I tried it in the other mode in front of the barking dog as well, but there was no effect on her wild barking. I decided that if this does nothing right in front of a barking dog's face, then it is unlikely to work from 50 feet away. I am disappointed and obviously returned the product.",dogs,3

"My vet recommended Evo. I ordered it even though it seemed it bit pricey. It came quickly. My dog loves it. From the moment it came out of the box, he went nuts just smelling the bag. Honestly -- I am not exaggerating one bit. He used to walk away bored when I put his dish down with the previous brand he ate, come back later, and then eat it. Well no more -- he's like a different dog at mealtime. Happy and satisfied. Enough said!",dogs,3
"I purchased this harness and collar for my bunny for outdoor playtime. I have an eight ft. high privacy fence but soon discovered he could slip under the narrowest opening of the fencing. This allows me to let him hop around outside, while being able to keep a better eye on him. The harness is very small. I have a Holland Lop (the smallest breed bun) and he is a baby. The harness is slightly big for him, turning somewhat as you hold the leash. It has velcro so you can easily adjust it. I have no doubt he will easily grow into this harness, but if you have a different breed bunny or larger type bun, this harness will not fit. It comes with a little bell on it which is nice. It allows me to hear where he is, if I am engaged in a book or otherwise occupied outside. He also has no issues having the harness being put on. It is lightweight and seemingly comfortable. It has holes in the fabric allowing it to breathe. Disadvantage",bunny rabbit central,1

I think I will keep it aside and one day, when I only have one cat, a young one, I will begin again to train it. The younger cat showed me it can be done. I would highly recommend this product for people with 1, young, cat. If I only had the younger cat, I'd be free of cat litter.",cats,2

"This tool is unbelievable! Our Lab/Golden Retriever mix has an undercoat that never quits shedding, and our Westie has a rough terrier coat that is hard to get through to the undercoat with regular combs/brushes. So far, this tool has given me at least two bags full of fur (I just got it a bit ago in the mail, so I'm not done yet--just taking a break!)and all I'm doing is brushing in the direction of the hair growth on top of the coat, not parting hair or going underneath to brush. The dogs seem to love it, too.I've been intrigued by this tool for some time, but was put off by the price in our local stores. When I found it for about 1/5 of the price on Amazon, I thought it had to be a knock-off, but it's the real thing! It has a substantial weight, is well made and feels ""tight""--exactly the same as the one I almost paid way too much for! If you have a pet, don't pass up the chance to get the Furminator at a very fair price on Amazon!",cats,2

"I have two cats and feed them in separate rooms. For one they don't get along and for two the second cat (Newman) eats too fast and too much. He will eat cat #1's (Beast) food. For this same reason I feed them four times daily (last time just before bed so he doesn't wake me up too early.) I got the ball to slow him down a little and it does a good job of that.Because he will sniff out and eat every last bit of food I did not have a problem with pieces on the floor. However, I would have to crawl around on the floor looking for the ball under pieces of furniture which quickly became a pain. So I ended up tossing it into a round flat bottomed container to keep it contained and it has worked out perfectly. The ball stays within the container, easy to find and it rolls around easily within the container and drops out the food. Also, easy cleanup and no crumbs on the flour.",cats,2
"Cute and soft. Comes with an extra squeaker, which is a good thing. Squeaker did break within five days, but easy to replace. Animal is still intact and second squeaker is working even though we play tug-of-war a few times each day. Perfect size toy for small dogs (Bichon/Yorkie mix).",dogs,3
"I was having great difficulty maintaining the Ph level in my aquariums. I had tried frequent water changes, putting shells in them, and other pieces of advice you find on the internet. Nothing worked. It was around 6 to not measurable by the test. Then someone at my LFS said to use this, and it fixed everything! I was hesitant because I don't like to use chemicals in my tanks other than Stress Coat to dechlorinate during water changes. I have not had an issue with ammonia, nitrites, or nitrates since I started using this, and the Ph levels are rock solid. I tried to fix the other chemical levels for about a year, but they straightened out after I leveled the Ph. I actually use less than the directions call for and test weekly to maintain it, but I never put any in except at water changes.I let it disolve in a cup while I am doing the water change. Otherwise particles will float around the aquarium until they dissolve. Some users complain about the phosphorus causing algae growth, but I love plecos so this is never a problem for me and I can't really say if it does!",fish aquatic pets,4
"This product is amazing. I really researched this before buying after having been burnt by the littermaid that I had struggled with for a year. This box actually lives up to its reviews. My 2 cats took to it right away. The first disposible box lasted 12 days with just my scooping out the solid stuff every 3 days or so. I now am using the forever tray and so far, so good. The best features of this are that it requires TRUELY almost no upkeep. You can really set it and forget it for a few days. The littermaid was constantly needing to be unjammed. I could never go even one day without scooping or troubleshooting it. Also, this scoop free really really keeps the box clean. Cleaning the littermaid was a major ordeal with all the parts and it being so heavy. One of the advantages to an automatic box is that the kitties should always have a clean box and that certainly wasn't the case with the littermaid.If the crystals are a bit more expensive than litter, it is a small price to pay for an almost work free litter box. I do wish the crystals were more widely available but having them delivered either through Amazon or Scoopfree is am easy option. I love, love, love this box!!",cats,2
"I have to give this a mixed review.My cat ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS TOY!She wasn't much of an active cat, but I wanted to interact and play with her more. And this toy makes her jump and run and spin and pounce and prance and dance and do the cat-equivalent of laughing and giggling (big wide eyes, slightly vibrating, hunkered down behind a pillow, watching its every move).She knows where I store it, and when I come home from work, she sits infront of its hiding place.HOWEVER --- it is not that durable.She and I play with it twice a day and it last about two weeks.When it breaks, the hardware that holds the feathered part shears off somewhere inside of the pole. After that, it really isn't usable any more, because if you try to attach the feathers back by simply tying the string to the feather part, the spinning magic is pretty much gone and the string gets tangled in an instant.So, consider this a disposable toy with a two-week-or-so life span.That is what I decided to do and now I buy three at a time.'Cause I've not found a better toy.My cat goes CRAZY over it.",cats,2

"I have two great danes, 150 lbs each, and they just LOVE to chew and shred things. I was sick of having pillow foam, filling materials, and shreds all over the house, that came from regular pillows, blankets, and dog cushions. That's why I bought two of these beds and both of the dogs just love them! I can't get them out of the beds, but then again, who would like to get out of a hammock?Easiest cleanup ever! I don't have to wash or deodorize anything, no worries about fleas or ticks, no sticks or dirt getting stuck in them. All I do every now and again is stand them up for a minute and sweep the dirt, dander, and hair out from underneath them. (I'd imagine this would be GREAT for allergy sufferers!) You don't even really have to hose them down. They DON'T smell or look dirty, even after a muddy dog lays in them.This has to be the most sturdy dog bed ever. After a year of owning the beds now, I have only had to re-tighten the screws once, and the covers are a bit saggy, but I'm sure my dogs would concur they are just broken in well. Even at 150 lbs each laying on them every night, all night, for a year straight, they are not torn, frayed, worn, or broken... They are not even chewed upon....And the best part",cats,2
"My much adored cat started pooing outside of his box and sometimes urinating as well. His favorite spot was our bed, so this made a frustrating problem even worse. He would also sometimes use a couch downstairs. I took him to the vet to check for a UTI, which he did not have. I changed the kind of litterbox and the kind of litter to Dr. Elsey. He would only use the litter box if it was next to our bed. As this was definitely not ideal, I was at my wits end. I tried this product, mixed it into the litter box and placed the box back in its original location. I put my cat into the litter box and he was immediately intrigued by the small. He used the box right then and has been using the box with no accidents now for over two months. I would highly recommend trying this product!",cats,2

In my search for something to feed my dogs, I had to balance my desire to not feed them the corn-laden garbage (which they cannot digest) sold in most supermarkets, against the $80+ per bag the premium foods cost. I even considered going to BARF (biologically appropriate raw food) but it's just too much work for me.This is excellent dog food at an excellent price.

"After trying different brands of 'store-bought' hay and getting frustrated at constantly having to throw away the soiled leftovers that my two rabbits wouldn't eat, I discovered Zupreem's Nature's Promise western timothy hay. They absolutely love it! The hay has a softer, more appetizing appeal than some other bagged hays (such as Kaytee, or even Oxbow) and with every purchase I've made of this hay so far, it is always fresh and has a deep, wonderful aroma. I can't keep enough in the hay rack now...it used to be that my rabbits would nibble at their hay and then just spread the rest about the floor, but now they eat every strand (and I provide them with LOTS!). For an animal such as a rabbit, where the bulk of their diet should be a good-quality hay, and where it is imperative for their digestive health to consume plenty of hay, this brand is wonderful, and is a godsend for anyone whose rabbits are picky eaters.",dogs,3

"Bought this thinking how great it would be to have without soil...latch it onto the fountain & viola...but too few sprouts make it not worth the extra time & effort. Use a small dish, good potting soil & viable seeds; sow seeds, lightly covered with soil, keep misted with H2O & you will have much better results in a day or two, just make sure you have the starter seed dish out of the way of the cat..at least till it's 4"" or so. No need for the fountain either. I found it to be too loud & can't control the flow well. Cats will drink out of a toilet, if you let them..they love trickling water.

"I always fear buying puppy toys - for the money, about half of the time, they don't play with them. But this one he loves! I think it's due to the cellophane crinkly sound that the little tabs make, he's fascinated by it. And he hasn't ripped it apart - amazing given he's a 4 month old Dobbie!Update 2/7/11Whoops, spoke too soon. Rafa ripped off one of the tabs. Still a great toy, but make sure you closely supervise play with it if your puppy is teething.",dogs,3

She hates & kills mice & these squirrels must be close enough, LOL, she digs them out of the toy log, shaking & biting them to make them squeek! Every day we wake up & within minutes she has A squirrel in her mouth, ready to play. They are great for playing fetch in the house too!",dogs,3
"I bought the Sporn No Pull Harness for my young yellow lab puppy. It did seem to help somewhat with her pulling, but the straps are very thin and dug into her skin every time she pulled (which is always). The black dye rubbed off on her light fur leaving two big black smudges on her chest and a black X across her back. Quite annoying - I had to scrub it pretty well with soap to try to get it off, only to have the problem recur every time I put it on her. I emailed the company to tell them of the problem and NEVER got a response. I guess the factory in China makes it out of material that is not colorfast and apparently Sporn doesn't care! If you have a light colored dog, then expect the color to rub off on their fur!! Also the fleece sleeves are not attached to the straps and came off every time I tried to put the harness on my dog. Also quite annoying to have to deal with that while my dog is jumping around anxiously anticipating her walk! I ended up stitching it to the strap to prevent the problem. Seems to me that is a solution that could easily be taken care of in production. I ended up scrapping the Sporn and buying an Easy Walk harness instead. Much better quality product that fits better, doesn't bleed on my dog's fur and stops her from pulling!!!!",dogs,3
"This box works well with managing litter, but because of the open top the odor just goes up and out. I feel like the old dome box I had kept the odor contained.It took about 2 weeks to get them used to this new box. I had their old one set up next to it during that time. They scratched up the litter liner, so that is useless to us. It is easy enough to clean without it.I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless litter scatter was a real problem for you.",cats,2
I got one of these pet thernal mats about 10 years ago and my two cats used it all the time.

I think it is safer than the electric mats.,cats,2

"This is a fantastic product. The cats love them and get a new mousie every day. Yes, they are small so they do lose them under furniture and once a week we have to have a mousie hunt to retrieve them. (also, the dogs try to steal them!) However, it's worth it for the fun of watching them play with these. They are a bargain price -- they cost 75% less than you'd pay at a pet store or supermarket. And, this is a terrific seller who donates part of his profits to cat shelters. It just doesn't get any better than this -- good toy, bargain price, quick shipment and a donation to a shelter. Just great!",cats,2
"This has helped keep a 55 gallon planted tank looking lush and green and very healthy. Just don't over do it, especially if you have freshwater shrimp.I use this with the Flourish trace and Flourish excel in a heavily planted tank with cardinal tetras, guppies, and cherry shrimp. For a couple of weeks I over did the doses (my plants were growing like weeds... it was great for awhile). I was putting in about a third of a capful of this and Excel and Flourish every day. I was changing 25% of the water once a week, but even with that suddenly I started losing cardinal tetras and lots of shrimp. I did a 40% water change, and that stopped the deaths.I've since dropped down to 1/3 of a capful twice a week of each treatment. Everybody is staying alive, and the plants are growing well without any yellowing. They aren't growing like they were before when I was overdosing, but it is good enough.This is a really helpful thing to have if you want to grow plants. There is enough in this bottle to last several months for a 55 gallon tank... if you don't use too much.",fish aquatic pets,4

"The theory behind this litterbox is genius, but it doesn't work as advertised. My cat urinates in the back corner, and the rake never could get it. It would scrape off part of the clump, which would get stuck to the rake, but it would leave the majority of it in the corner. The clumps would stick the bottom of the pan, and it was a real pain to clean them off. I had to scoop this litterbox and clean the rake off 4 times in the two days I used it, which is twice as much as I scoop my regular litterbox in a whole week! Don't waste your money.",cats,2

I have a 4 month old dachshund puppy and he has plenty of room for his bed and toys and loves it. It says in the instructions not to only put it on carpet due to scratching or sliding, but we have had no problems with either. Our dog jumps on it and it does not slide at all--there are rubber feet that keep it in good placement. It is built well, and I love that the bars are placed in such a way as my puppy can't get his teeth stuck! One more thing is that if you have a very tiny puppy and a small space you could take out a panel and make it into a triangle with no problem. It is versatile.",dogs,3

"I have used the gentle leader for at least a couple of years now. I have two little 20-25 lb. dogs that I walk twice a day with them on either side of me. When they were still puppies they would choke themselves with traditional collars trying to run ahead. When I used a harnass they would still pull. However, once I switched to the gentle leader they became much calmer. It's not perfect. They still try to pull when they see another dog or a cat, however, they are easily controlled and for most of the walk they trot along perfectly beside me. I've already worn out the first gentle leaders I bought and just purchased two more.",dogs,3
"My poor Lab is still recovering from her bad experience with this toy. I bought a Kong just like this and filled it with treats for my sweet 3 year old rescue Lab. I followed all the instructions, but still, within minutes, her nose was bleeding and all the skin on the top part of her nose had been scraped off. I guess she stuck her nose in there to investigate, just like a dog would, and then all the skin on her nose got scraped off. I took the toy away from her as soon as I noticed. There was blood all over her dog bed. That was over 2 months ago, and her sweet little nose still hasn't healed properly.I mentioned this whole fiasco to my sister-in-law, and she said that her dog cut up his nose, too, on this exact same toy in the exact same way. Buyer beware--what seems like something nice for your doggie may actually really hurt him.",dogs,3

We live in the middle of a little town and every time our dogs get tied outside, my one dog, Macy, will just go on and on about anything and everything! She never listens! Other dogs in the neighborhood then start barking, and it becomes completely obnoxious. As soon as we put this collar on her though, she responded very well to it and stopped! Once in a while she'll forget it's there, but with a gentle spray, it quickly reminds her. Our house is sooooooo quiet now, and I'm thrilled that the dogs making a racket in the town do NOT belong to me!!!!!!",dogs,3

"I bought a pair of dog clippers at Walmart for like [...] bucks and they just couldn't ""cut it"" with my dogs thick hair so after reading reviews on several different types of clippers, I decided to go with these. I must say, I am so glad I did. I took them Right out the package and did in 15 minutes twice as much as what it took me over 1hr with the 40 dollar pair. Boy does my bear feel much better, even though they are louder than the cheaper ones, probably cause they are more powerful, my dog did not mind it. But I did have a hard time getting him to sit up as he loves being clipped so much that he will just lay down and go to sleep on me during the process, (not due to him getting tired cause he hasn't sat there long enough to get tired) guess it relaxes him. All I have to do is plug up and turn on and he is right there ready, they didn't get as hot As I thought they would with the way some of the reviews stated, I thought they were rather easy to handle, and I am by far not a professional groomer at all. I did Think they were great, awesome, and WOW!!!",dogs,3

"I have used Tri-Force on my 3 indoor/outdoor cats for 2 years now, and I find it to be generally effective, no offensive smell, and minimal irritation on the cats. However, it tends to be less effective on my 16-lb cat (perhaps the dosage is a bit small for him). I have found it somewhat deficient at preventing re-infestation after killing off the initial fleas, so I use it in conjunction with an oral flea medication from Little City Dogs -Flea Killer Capsules for Cats and Small Dogs - 12 Mg Nitenpyram Per Capsule ...Same Active Ingredient As Capstar - 12 Capsules Treats 12 Pets 2 to 25 lbs. The affordability of both these medications make an ideal flea-fighting regimen in our house.",cats,2
"I first acquired one of these toys as a gift last year to our mini Dachshund, Dexter. He literally would not play with any other toy. We would play fetch for an hour or more at a time with this toy. He even played with it long after the squeak had been ""chewed silent"". I ran across a similar toy in the grocery store recently, and the same thing happened. When that toy began to show wear, I could not find any more in stores, so I went to Amazon. The vendor had four left, and I bought three of them.I know that enjoyment of a toy is an individual thing with dogs, but Dexter, for one, absolutely loves these toys. The squeak realy gets his attention, and he loves to fetch it. After a time, though, he is content to play with it by himself. Dex is also a bit of a chewer, and these toys last days longer than anything else.",dogs,3
"This toy is absolutely my Boxer puppy's favorite toy. Filled with small snacks and biscuits it becomes a treat dispenser and keeps him busy for hours. He's a heavy chewer, and hasn't put a dent in this ball. It's also large enough so there's no chance of him choking on it.",dogs,3

"A problem I had with my CatGenie actually improved my cat's health. Lucky (cat) eliminated soft feces. In the old litter box, it was next to impossible to remove the bits and pieces. I bought a CatGenie, which I love. The house always smelled clean. Then one day I smelled a really bad odor. I called the CatGenie service people. When I described the smell, the nice lady (Salina?) asked about my cat's feces. Yes, Lucky did pass loose, small ones. She explained that sometimes little bits could slip through the Genie Hand no matter how many times it scoops through the granules. She sent me a CatGenie newsletter about soft feces, written by a veterinarian who is expert on the subject. I changed Lucky's diet and no more loose stools. He has perked up, lost weight, and he has normal bowel movements. CatGenie works perfectly. I would recommend it to any cat person who hates the litter box. And get that newsletter if your cat has soft ones.",cats,2

"Our ten month old beardie puppy LOVES this toy. We're starting to hate it, he plays with it so much. All we hear is squeak squeak squeak, for hours on end. When we go to work in the morning, we stuff a few treats in the log with the squirrels. When we come home, the treats are eaten, some of the squirrels are inevitably strewn around the room, and he's usually sitting there, holding the log or another squirrel, ready to play. Squeak squeak squeak. All night. The fact that he can hold a squirrel in his mouth while simultaneously barking and squeaking it only makes it more fun/annoying/cute.It's a fun group toy. My husband and I usually each claim a squirrel and have him chase us around the house, throwing squirrels and squeaking other ones when the puppy picks up the thrown one. Pup thinks it's the best game ever.We bought the large, which was a little smaller than expected - about the size of a volleyball. But it turned out being perfect for our 40 pound dog.Two months of daily, near constant play, and it's still going strong. No tears, squeakers are (unfortunately) fully functioning. Still holds his interest more than any other toy he has. Squeak. Squeak. Squeak.",dogs,3
"After less than a week, we had to take this toy away from the dog. Here's the problem.Our dog loved his small (10-inch) jolly ball and tried to play soccer with it. He also kept trying to pick it up, and it got very scratched and rough. We thought that buying a larger one would solve that problem. He can't get his mouth around it, it's true; but there is a problem. The larger sizes have a removable plug so that you can fill the ball with water. The plug is in a recessed ""hole"" in the ball -- which gives the dog a place to bite on. His teeth made deep gashes in the ""indestructible"" plastic. The rough edges then scratched his nose to the point of bleeding. I do not see any large versions of this ball without the plug. So, if your dog is at all inclined to use his mouth, this toy is NOT a good choice.",dogs,3

"Well I have 2 cats. One is 11yrs old the other is 3yrs old. My 11 yr old I've had for 8yrs and she's always had problems using the litter box, but she would at times. I tried different foods because she does have food allergies and I've tried all sorts of cat litters.I even tried the cat feliway plugins (big waste of money),nothing worked. When we had moved into our apartment about 3yrs ago she completely refused to use either litter box. She would go anywhere and everywhere. About 6 months ago she's started going pee continously in one spot so we started putting puppy pads down and it worked for the pee but she'd still go poop on the floor. I saw this cat litter at PetSmart. It was a little pricey but I figured why not try it. To my surprise my cat used the litter box that night and has continously used it since!! For a trouble cat of 8yrs all I had to do was put the litter in the box and she did the rest! The clumping is also the best I've tried even though it does clump pretty bad in one spot and sticks to the litter box (wich is only because the cat pees in the same spot over and over). It also great for the odor. We have our litter box in the bedroom to keep the dog and 2yr old son out of it, we never have a problem with odor. We also clean out the box every night to keep the kitties happy. This litter really works great and I'll continue to buy it as long as I have cats!",cats,2

"When I began Furminating, so much hair was coming off of my cat that I thought maybe I could make one of those hairless cats like you see in pictures; all skin. After an hour of Furminating I had a large pile of hair, enough to fill an average size moving box. The cat looked alright, and was in fact writhing in ecstasy from the Furmination. Feeling encouraged, I thought, ""This Furminator rocks. I'll have a hairless cat in no time!"" So I Furminated more, filling up box after box with hair. It is now late evening, and after eight hours of straight Furminating, I have six moving boxes full of hair. However, the cat still looks exactly the same, with the same amount of hair on her as before the Furmination. I am pretty disappointed and don't understand how this is possible. I believe the fault is with the cat however, rather than with this product, so I gave it five stars.",cats,2
"My long haired chihuahua is overweight. Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.TIP",dogs,3

I can use a regular dog brush, and get barely anything off of them, and then use this and end up with a plastic baggie full! This is a wonderful brush that all pet parents should own. It works on the sleek hair of the GP/Lab mix, and the big fluffy cotton-y hair of the American Eskimo!!!

"The elastic hole for the eggs to go in is too tight. Its a struggle for me to get them out let alone my husky. I pulled one half way out so he could get it the rest of the way and he did but then ignored the animal and just played with the egg. he had it out less than 2 minutes when he made a choking sound and the egg was gone! HE SWALLOWED THE EGG WHOLE!!!! I wouldn't have thought this possible! The eggs themselves are about 2.75"" x 3"" with a squeaker inside and he swallowed it whole! This isn't a bash on the product but just a warning to those with larger dogs, these can be swallowed whole! My dog only weighs 54lbs so he isn't huge by any means but he was able to suck that egg down in no time, I dropped him at the vet to get the egg removed and the only way to get something that large out is surgery, its too large for them to pass it or pull out through the throat. This $10 toy rapidly turned into a $610 toy after I pay for this surgery tomorrow not to mention the stress put on my poor little buddy. This toy is getting its 3* out of 5* because of the difficulty in removing the eggs not because my dog is a dumbass who swallows giant squeaky eggs. Great for small - medium small dogs, large breed owners beware!",dogs,3

The only part that we had to replace was the reservoir and that is because I dropped and cracked it. The good thing is that of any one part breaks or wears out, you can order a replacement part. We change the filters about 1x a month for 2 cats. We use filtered water in it and I wash it thoroughly 1x a week.We have 2 cats and they love this! They used to ""ask"" us to turn the faucet on for them to drink from bu now, they have running water all the time, whenever they want it. I don't know what it is that makes it so cute but I just love watching them lap from it. They surely rink more water now which is great for kidney health as well.We leave the cover off the front top part because they also like to drink from the top where the water flow over the edge. We bought this for $70, which felt steep, but even at that price, it's absolutely worth every penny! For the $42 price it is a bargain!

"I used this product on our puppy, who came to us saturated in fleas. He has been receiving baths every other day to lower their numbers, but I wanted to use frontline to kill and repel the remaining fleas. I applied the product as directly (between the shoulder blades) and let it dry. Over the first couple of days, fleas were noticeably dropping off of him whenever he sat still. You could see them twitching on the floor and I was actually getting excited because the product was working so well. However after one week, it seems the effects wore off. The fleas are back at full force, but I have to wait until the beginning of march (1 month later) to apply the second dose. We change and wash his bedding and vacuum the carpets and rugs every day. They don't seem to bite any of the humans, but they are definitely driving the dog crazy. I live in Hawaii and I understand that high humidity makes flea eggs hatch faster, but I was expecting more than just 1 week protection, especially after the price I had to pay for it! Overall, if the second dose has the same effect as the first, I will not be buying any frontline products again.",dogs,3

We taped into place an 8x10 frame (which fit that opening pretty closely) and that solved the problem. Cats go through, border collies don't. Great product at a decent price.",dogs,3

Since I started using this I have noticed that I can pet him without getting a handful of fur and there isn't dog hair all over the floors of my house. If this can take care of a husky blowing his coat it can do anything. (Literally I can brush my dog every day and get a full trash can of dead fur out every day for a month or more!) Love this too because it is non-irritating and my dog doesn't feel punished when I brush him for a long time.",cats,2

"I bought this for my 10 year old, 80 lb dog who is arthritic and diabetic. I have a Mazda hatchback; without a ramp it is very difficult for her to haul herself up into the back seat.I gave this ramp four stars but that is only for the product & the company itself (ie construction, perceived durability, quick shipping, etc...) NOT for the usefullness of the product, at least in my car, which is not an SUV or particularly high. I give it two stars for usefullness and ease of use.The ribbed surface has good traction and the construction seems good. This ramp is too short to be used to climb into the hatchback. The angle is too steep and there is no ""lip"" to secure it. But, the ramp is too wide to fit in the rear door so we just cannot use it. I will try to make use of it in the house or back porch. I recommend going to a store to try this out before purchasing.",dogs,3

It simply sits on the base without locking in to place. If there were some way to lock the water onto the base, it would be a great product. I didn't have a problem filling the water container.",cats,2

"When I say little I sure do mean it! Like other reviewers have said it's got white nibs on the wire which is great for protecting the skin of a short hair dog but I would imagine it could be problematic for a mid-long haired small dog.I use it on my Chihuahua-Mini Pincher mix and it took a few scoldings to get him to stop nipping at it but now he doesn't seem to mind a daily brushing from this brush. Since his hair is so short I can't say whether or not it is helpful for removing stray hairs or shedding but with regular baths and daily brushing he has a beautiful coat!Also - the purple/blue handle is the soft plastic that puppies LOVE getting their teeth into so make sure you keep this out of your dog's reach, otherwise whose fault is it that they like chewing on it? :)",cats,2

They enclosed a pre-paid postage sticker to send back the broken part. The company was very customer friendly.

"I have four of these and they are a great help. Some of my cats a are a little finicky about their litterboxes and will stop using them if they're not perfectly clean. Since I work all day and the cats are on their own, I can count on these self-cleaning litter boxes to keep the box up to my cats' high standards.My only complaint is LitterMaid's quality control can be a little inconsistent. Over the years I've had defective units right out of the box a little more often than I'd like. I don't think it's unique to LitterMaid, I've seen similar QC problems with just about anything made in China. If LitterMaid has a choice, they really should reconsider where they're doing business. It's at the point that if I have a choice between products either made in China or elsewhere, I choose the product NOT made in China just because I've been burned too many times by shoddy workmanship, even from supposedly name brand products.",cats,2

"While I was visiting Puerto Rico in October 1997 I fell in love with a kitten that had been abandoned. When I called the airlines to see if it would be possible to carry my new kitten on the plane WITH ME (she was too small, only 4 weeks old to go in cargo) they recommended that I buy a carrier that could fit under the airplane seat. I had not heard of anything like this, but I went to the closest pet store and asked them if they had one. THEY DID - this very one for less than $20. I bought it and brought her back home with me.Not only was the carrier a perfect fit under the seat it was a perfect size to sit on top of the seat tray so I could check on her (feed her/comfort her). PLUS I loved that you couldn't really see inside and poke around because it kept her more calm. I have had this carrier since! Nothing has broken! Anytime I had to carry her anywhere (moving, vets, pet-sitters) I used it. In her adult - senior age she was used to it, and although it didn't give her a lot of wiggle room this was by far the best way to transport her. I once used a ""new"" carrier thinking the extra wiggle room would be appreciated but half way through the drive she peed. Sometimes less is best.Today I am buying another one so the new kitten doesn't have to share but I still have the 1st one and I will never get rid of it.",dogs,3

"We have had 7 cats over the past decade (not all at once thank heavens!) and thats a lot of scooping. Right now we only have one cat, but he is incredibly sensitive to a dirty litterbox. It's gotten to the point he wants it absolutely clean every time he needs to use it, which is an impossible task. He'll actually sit outside the box and meow until someone takes care of it! We've been considering an easier method for some time to get the job done. So, we purchased the Scoopfree litterbox two weeks ago after reading numerous reviews of the different automatic litterboxes on the market. This one seemed to make the most sense because it does not use clumping litter, which I've read often sticks to the rake device and liquids pass down to the bottom of the litter, never fully drying/clumping. I had never used crystals, but after reading how they absorb liquids and odors I was willing to give it a test drive.We paid $99 after price searching the web. The device arrives in a HUGE box, but in reality seems to be the size of a large litter pan. Setup was quick and easy. We placed the Scoopfree in the same spot as the old litterbox, removing that one out of the house. This was a bold step since our cat hadn't used crystals and I was afraid he might be confused. He did notice the difference and inspected it completely, but has proceeded to use the device with no problems.He's a large cat (about 16lbs - and not overweight) and fits the box. The motor isn't loud - we can't hear it from another room in our house. The raking cycle doesn't take long, only about a minute. The crystals are working terrific, absorbing the liquids and odors just as indicated. Another bonus is the freedom from the litter dust that gets scattered and tracked. I've only seen a few crystals kicked out in two weeks, so that's saved on additional sweeping around the box. A few days ago the kitty blocked the optical sensor with a pile of crystals from his insane covering, so the rake didn't scoop automatically. This was solved by pressing the button to manually scoop. Since then we give the box a quick look once a day to make sure it's clean and working. The cardboard cartridge is holding up, although I have heard that some cats dig to the point of scratching the bottom, which may cause a leak or tear. Ours doesn't have that problem, but before we placed the cartridge we covered it with a garbage bag for added protection. We then put it under the Scoopfree as directed and filled it with crystals. This hasn't impaired the device from functioning and I think will lead to an extended cartridge life (which is a benefit since we are on a budget).Two factors to consider with this device are that the hood and refill cartridges are sold separately. The cartridges are a little on the expensive side depending on where you can find them ranging from $12 to $17. A cartridge is determined to last one month for one cat.Overall we are really happy with the Scoopfree. It does have a 90 day money back guarantee and a 1 year warranty. It has been super easy to use and has already saved quite a bit of time in terms of scooping and cleaning. Our cat is really happy and no more meowing at the box, which is a great relief to us. We would definitely recommend it to everyone.",cats,2

"I have two Chihuahua Mixes -- 6lbs and 11 lbs -- that I am using this collar on. The whole undergound fence idea is great -- don't get me wrong -- I've used it for years on my larger dogs when I had them. But for small dogs, don't expect these recievers to be perfect. First of all, they look gigantic on my two small dogs. Second, smaller dogs (as small dog owners know) are much more sensitive and the prongs are really uncomfortable for them once you get them as snug as they need to be without the whole collar sliping over their little tiny heads. And, finally, battery life is a real problem; turn them off when you can to help conserve. In hindsight, I would just get the smallest normal dog size of receiver and attach it to a regular collar using the shortest probes.",dogs,3
"My 10 year old little (3 lb) puppy has the small Omega Paw Tricky Treat ball.

It lets her run around after getting out of her afternoon crate, I can make dinner, she doesn't eat her food in 2 secs flat (like out of a bowl), and frankly -it's the cutest thing she does. She pushes it around topspeed for about 20 secs with her nose and paws. She boxes it in with her paws, and then she zigzags around where the all just passed making sure she didn't lose a piece of kibble.Let's not forget, I get a live version of puppy soccer in my living room and there's no ill effects to my walls or floor.She's so happy with this toy that when it's empty, it gets carried back to her honorific toy spot on her bed (the only time she teeths on it).If it ever wears out (seems unlikely so far), I'd get her another one in a heartbeat.And I haven't noticed bad / plasticy smells from this toy like some other reviewers mentioned - when I got it or now.",dogs,3

"I will admit, I was skeptical about this product but due to the great reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did. I have four dogs and work from home. Naturally, these dogs are my pets and love to sleep in my office. The problem had been that they would erupt into barking at any movement outside. My office has two windows on the front side of the house so there was frequently something to bark at. Of course, once one starts, they all get crazy and are completely unruly to quiet down. I previously found myself trying to yell louder than their barking which is complete insanity. Anyways, since I got the Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer, that has all changed. They no longer bark like a pack of lunatics. In fact, I beleieve, they are much better behaved overall. I have used this product only a few times on the dogs. They now know when I show them it, not to bark. I praise them profusely when I know they really want to bark but aren't because they know the ""doggy mute button"" will be their consequence. In addition, I have found I do not need the full 1-2 sec tone. I just quickly press and release the button and that is enough. It is really great because you appear ""silent"" to the rest of the world while you are correcting your dogs behavior. It has truly been a God send and I would highly recommend this product to anyone with behavior that needs correction. Just make sure you still give your pets lots of praise for their good behavior and you will be thrilled with the results - I know I have been!",dogs,3

I tried every cleaning spray, carpet shampoo, and air freshner. Nothing worked, so my vet told me to give the Feliway a try. Believe me, I was to the point that I actually considered giving cats away. I would clean a spot, and 2 seconds later it was sprayed again! It took a good 4 months to see the difference. I have 3 plug-ins to cover the bottom floor of my home. I also purchased another item that someone else wrote about to do the initial cleaning of the urine spray, called ""Anti-Icky Poo"". I thought it was a joke, but that stuff is awesome as well! Also, the fighting between the male and female stopped. Be patient, and give this product a chance to work, because it does!",cats,2
I like this collar because it realy helps us control our dogs jumping when guests are around. We don't even have to shock her. She remembers the initial shock from when we first got the collar and after that all we need to use is the warning beep. All we have to do is put this collar on her and she obeys everything we tell her!,dogs,3
"Smells great, leaves my GSD's fur soft & silky for at least 3 weeks. Every time she gets damp, I can smell the shampoo fragrance on her. For the first week, I can even smell it when we're just hanging out together.",dogs,3
"First of all, Tuffy toys aren't meant for dogs to sit down and chew on. They are play toys, and if used the way they're meant to be used they will last for a VERY long time. If you let your dog chew on this toy all they want, then yes, it won't last very long. My dog loves to play with this toy, it is her favorite toy and her go-to for tug-of-war. We don't let her take it away and chew on it, though we do let her squeak the squeakers and throw it around for herself. We bought it in July for her Birthday, and it's now September and she hasn't broken through the first layer. The squeakers do break pretty fast, but all it takes is for the dog to bite it the wrong way. My dog goes through cow hooves in less then a day, rawhide in 2 minutes. She is a very strong chewer. I would definitely recommend the octopus for a strong play toy for a good chewer. There is no toy that will survive a dog chewing on it all they want. If you want to give your dog something to chew on and destroy, get a hoof, rawhide strips, or a bone. If you want a great fun toy for you and your dog to play with, this is it.",dogs,3
"I have been using Natural Balance food rolls for over a year as a food topper. I found that the most convenient way to distribute the topper so that it mixes evenly with the kibble (and makes the whole dish taste better) is by putting it in a food processor and grating it small bits. We call them the dogs' ""sprinkles.""I had not tried the beef flavor yet and thought the dogs would appreciate a change of pace. Unfortunately our routine is out of whack now. When put into a food processor and ground, this food roll turns into a paste and sticks to itself, basically turning into a solid again. We cannot just ""sprinkle"" it on top of food. Although I like the Natural Balance products, if you plan on grinding down the roll- don't get this flavor!",dogs,3
"This works for a lot of cats and I've used it successfully in the past. However, my current cats think it's a toy and keep pawing, scratching, and biting at it until they remove it from whatever surface it's on. Occasionally they will carry it around after that. I recommend trying some double stick tape first to see how your cats react.",cats,2
"I love this cat nip and my two kids loved it too. This is there very first Xmas with me. I got one cat given to me by my vet after my cat of six years passed away.The owners who had her did not have a home and I was sucker punched, and I got the two month old male at a the shelter adopt day. Lilly and Mica. happy as clams, they still don't know about the second cat tree that's coming. I will get the Yewoow balls as the last thing too.And by the way, I got my order in only four days; fast!",cats,2
This is a well made product but I just couldn't get my dog on it for any length of time. She is a medium sized dog and she seems to prefer her pillow beds more. I'm just sorry it didn't work for us because it is a great idea & it is super easy to put together. I am donating it to our local animal shelter where I'm sure it will be greatly appreciated.,cats,2
"I have three dogs and now have three Coolaroo's. They love it, we even moved one into the house for them. WOuld highly recommend this product to anyone with a dog.",cats,2
"This is the perfect storage container for my cats' dry food. I also keep their treats in small containers in the same bin. The product looks pretty sturdy so it should last for a while. One of my cats figured out how to open it after a couple of weeks so now I have to hide it in the closet. The bin did have a strong plastic smell on the inside when first arrived. I washed it and aired it out. Doesn't seem to be a big deal now. Overall, a good product and reasonably priced.",dogs,3
"My sheltie had 3 accidents within a 2 week period this last spring... we don't know why, but she hasn't done it since, so we think she might not have been feeling well. In any case, I had some carpet to clean with an enzymatic cleaner, and while I knew the general area, I couldn't remember exactly where Zoey had gone pee.You have to use this detector in a pitch dark room.... I think most UV lights have this limitation, even for the professionals. At our old house, we had a pro carpet cleaner come in and treat pet stains, and they could only do this at night with their UV detector, so the cleaners were over late at night to detect and treat.When I used the Simple Solution Spotter, the urine showed up as very pale, dull yellow spots on my dark thick brown carpet. Zoey has a habit of starting to walk away before she's fully finished peeing, so there were little trailing drips I had to track down - this was the hardest part of treating the stains. Other than having to be on my hands and knees, staring hard at the carpet, it was easy enough to start at one area, and work my way backwards until I'd found all 3 spots she'd made.I'm glad I bought the Simple Solution UV Urine Detector even though I've only had occasion to use it once, and amazon had a lower price than my local pet supply store.Not that this has to do with the detector itself, but I found it helpful to use a manual pressure sprayer while treating the stains. I found mine in the garden supply area of a hardware store. Mine's larger than regular trigger spray bottles, and you can tilt it forward and downward to spray the carpet - something that's hard to do with a trigger spray bottle, as liquid would move away from the straw part of the trigger bottle, and nothing would come out. This wasn't a problem with the manual pressure sprayer... I'd fill it, pump it to build pressure, and I'd have plenty of stain treater to do the entire area. This way, I didn't have to stop to refill the bottle, coming back to the carpet and trying to find where I left off. Hope this tip helps!",cats,2
"So the product does not appear particularly sturdy. I have to worry that if my dogs pull hard enough, the plastic clips will break. I had also hoped it would derail some of the pulling, but it doesn't at all. It does free up my hands, which is nice, but I still have to grab the leash portion to correct them when they pull, so I might as well just be holding the leash.If you are a serious runner who is concerned about form and your dog is already reasonbly good on the leash, this might be perfect for you. However, if you are a haphazard jogger with 2 80lb idiots (one of whom has a crazy obsession with the neighbor's donkey statue), then you'll probably want to pass on this. I barely use it and I would have sent it back if I hadn't lost the packaging.",dogs,3
"A great treat that your dogs will love. Even our slightly picky dogs love these treats. They clean their teeth too! Also, they don't smell like some rawhides and other natural products. I wish the lasted a little longer - our larger dog eats his in a couple of minutes.",dogs,3

"I got one of these for my ancient dog because she gets such pains in her back legs. It took a little while for her to start using it, but I did notice less stiffness once she did. Now my less ancient dog has taken it over (even though they would both fit on it), so I may have to get another one. Glad they are a good price. I didn't have any trouble assembling it. It is a very large size, and seems to be quite sturdy.",cats,2

"This was my 4th seat cover I have purchased in the past 2 yrs. I have a very spoiled Mastiff who likes to go everywhere with me. I have purchased both cheaper & more expensive seat covers in the past, and none have worked as well for me, my dog or my car.Here may be some things to consider:1. It only comes in the tan-ish color (so if you are looking to match it to you car, hope you have tan interior)2. It is ""industrial"" which is very good for durabilty but it loses a bit in th elooks department (I have decided function is better than esthetics after 4 of these things)3. Of ocurse it does not anchor to leather seats as well as it does to cloth seat (I have 2 cars w/ leather seats & one w/ cloth)4. Size wise it fits most 4 door cars well; perfect fit for Elantra, good fit for Infiniti G35 & pretty good fit for BMW 5 series-but a bit short for the 5 series5. The head rest straps are the easiest ones to use of all the 4 others I have tried to fit to my cars & they secure the cover very well6. The lower seat straps were pretty useless in all 3 of my cars but may work in someone elses, I just cut them off & havent really noticed I needed them.7. There was a bit of a smell when I bought it, so I just unrolled it & let it air out on my balcony before putting it in my car.In my opinion the very low cost & durabilty definitely outweigh the slightly unattractive look, but if you have a tan-ish interior it does blend well.",dogs,3
"I had looked around for a new litter box for my household and had originally been thinking of going with an automatic litter box. With the poor reviews of the littermaid series and the high costs of other automatic boxes ($300+) I was pleasantly surprised when I found the Omega Paw litter box. I was intrigued by the idea, as it seemed like it was essentially the same idea as the Litter Robot, but done manually as opposed to automatically. The difference in price was the biggest component in swaying my decision. With the Omega Paw being about 10% of the cost of the Litter Robot, my decision was easily made. I read the reviews about the box and clasps being a bit flimsy. I have not had my box for terribly long (about a week and a half), but I do have to agree with that. You have to consider, also, that this is only about a $30 investment. I think for the price, it is well worth the investment. To help prevent leakage of litter and the clasps coming out, I have taped the seam of where the top and bottom come together and have also purchased a few screws and bolts to replace the flimsy clasps.The box is so easy to use; I cannot stress that enough. You just turn the box over, a bit further than I expected it needed to be at first, and then roll it back and pull out the drawer and empty into the trash. It takes so much less time than conventionally scooping the litter box, and it also is much much cleaner because you don't have to really touch much. I have three cats and they all use it and started using it right away. My little cat is absolutely fascinated by it and she always comes to watch me when I start to turn the box over. One of my older cats was a bit weary of it at first, and I try not to turn the box to empty it when he is in the room because he's a bit skittish and doesn't like the idea of his litter box moving. If you have cats that are easily spooked, I would maybe suggest not turning it when they can see you doing it. The Omega Paw litter box is truly a great product.",cats,2
"This is not only a good product for cat odors, it's also a good cleaner, so you can use it without worrying about your cat getting poisoned by an ammonia based cleaner.",cats,2
"This is the third of the Flexi leashes I've purchased and by far the best. Initially I was concerned that it would be heavier than I like. but it is comfortable in my hand and doesn't start to feel heavy after holding it for awhile.The ribbon is a great improvement. It feels much safer and it glides quietly and smoothly. Mine seems to get a little twisted on the walk and I'm not sure why. There is a very good swivel hook at the top that should prevent this, but the plus side is that it untwists very easily and doesn't present a problem.I'd highly recommend this leash. If it lasts as long as the others did, it will be with me for years to come.",dogs,3
"My trainer suggested these treats to help calm our dogs (we were a class of puppies) and as training treats. My puppy loves them (but at 40# it takes a number of them to have a calming effect on her). They tend to be expensive, so any time I can find them at a good price, it's worth it. Easy purchase, good price, great product!",dogs,3
"The product attracted my cats, but I think they responded as if it were catnip. I did not want them rolling in the litter, only using it. To be fair, one of my cats had a bladder infection which turned out to be the reason for her inappropriate urination. My other cat loved the smell.",cats,2

"I bought these as a healthy treat for my new boxer puppy. To begin with, I recieved canidae dog treats .. for senior and over weight. The description of the product does not mention this. My puppy ate the treats fine and seemed to enjoy them, but I found them to be a bit messy. After a treat there would be crumbs all over the floor. Nonetheless, my puppy found them tasty.",cats,2
"My dog loves it and sleeps in in every night as a bed! I added a small mattress under it to add a little more padding because the center of the bed is not padded. However, the dog loves the outside rim and lays her head on it for support. Would reccomend for any dog!",dogs,3
Sturdy yet lightweight and easy to use. Can set it up in seconds and from its construction will last many years. The ramp is skid resistant so the dogs have an easy time going up and down without slipping. Both dogs were on it at the same time adding up to close to 300 pounds and it supported the weight with no problem. One minor problem is if your not careful you can pinch your fingers in the hinge end as it can fold quickly as I found out.,dogs,3
"Wow -- does this solve a ton of problems! And I was all ready to put out the big bucks for a ModCat litter box! My cat is 14, but she figured it out right away, and best of all, no more having to put the litter box in ridiculous places that my crafty dogs couldn't reach (they just love those tootsie rolls! -- ewwwww!)Highly recommended -- get one now and life will be better in your critter department!!",cats,2

"Bought this to be a travel cage for the little bunster (I have an adult netherland dwarf rabbit). The cage was easy to assemble and I received it the day after ordering! Quality is good from what I can see.I took a star off because the lip down into the cage from the top of the door/ramp is the only source of hesitation from my rabbit. With eyes on the side of his head, depth perception isn't something he excels in and the drop is enough to cause concern; He will eagerly go to the top of the opening but then refuse to make that last hop in...even with his favorite food as incentive. Ironically if I place him into the cage he will happily eat the food and then jump out with little trouble. Perhaps if you have a rabbit larger then 2.5 pounds they may not have this issue.",bunny rabbit central,1
"Best money I have spent in a long time--My dog, Angel, couldn't make it up on the bed where she prefers to be or down so she just barked when she wanted to move and I came in a hurry to hush her up...now she goes up and down whenever it suits her..Made my life much easier..thanks...",dogs,3

I have used this product for three separate cats that have had problems over the past two years and each time I have been amazed at the quick results that this product produced. All three cats immediately went to the box and started going there each time they had to go- no more problems. I highly recommend this product with two paws up!,cats,2
"I was curious about the Furminator, but I balked at the almost $40 price tag at a well-known pet products store. Amazon's price was more reasonable so I gave it a try. My long-haired cat dislikes being groomed; I have about 10 seconds each time, if I'm lucky! With the Furminator I can get several good, productive passes over his coat before the claws come out, so a little each day is making a big difference in his coat. it appears this tool doesn't hurt him like everything else did. Highly recommend!",cats,2

"Max the Dachshund was far from the worst barker, but he had a habit of sitting by the French doors (his only way to see the outside world) and barking occasionally at a squirrel or bird, or maybe just the leaves of trees rustling in the wind. Not rapid barking, but persistent. When you told him to stop, he'd look at you, and then in true dachshund fashion, he'd stop long enough to let you know he understood you, but resume soon enough to let you know he had a dachshund will of his own. So finally we ordered this collar.It instantly stopped his barking-at-nothing-in-particular habit. When something really noteworthy happened (someone at the door), he'd still bark, but that's okay -- we want him to bark when someone's at the door.After about three days, we removed the collar (we always removed it at night -- Max never barked then anyway). About a week later, he started the irritating barking again, but the return of the collar stopped that instantly and after a day we removed it again. The mere threat of the return of the collar seems to keep the barking in check. I've read reviews from people who felt they had to leave the collar on, even if turned off, but we haven't had to do that. In fact, I've joked that the thing was so effective, so quickly, that I won't feel it was worth the money unless I get the collar out occasionally and spray Max just for the heck of it.The citronella smell is very faint, at least to this human nose, and pleasant (to human noses) anyway.I suspect every dog will react differently, but for Max this thing was perfect.",dogs,3
"Bought this fountain as an upgrade from a petmate whose pump died (it had died many times before, but nothing I did this last time could get it functioning). I wish I'd bought this fountain from the get go. I find it easier to clean than the petmate, easier to refill, and just easier to keep clean in general. The only problem I've had is some overflow over the sides. I think I've figured out that when the grate in front of the pump gets filled with cat hair, the water level rises, and when the cats drink, water splashes over the sides. Otherwise, it's been fabulous.",cats,2
"In a holiday flurry of activity, I ordered this 25 w heater for my half-filled ten gallon aquarium environment where a little turtle and three zebra fish live. It arrived in the mail on Friday, I popped it in the 7 gallon tank that evening, set the thermostat to 73 F, turned down my house thermostat to 60 F, and headed out the door for the weekend, keeping my fingers crossed. I was shocked to arrive home on Sunday night to a perfectly regulated temperature in my tank (and happy turtle and fish), even though my home was a good ten degrees colder. Though this is not a recommended technique for getting your tank set with the heater, it sure gives me confidence in this little submersible Italian heater. I'm very impressed so far. The thermostat and the fact that it submerges a bit or totally makes it very easy to operate.",fish aquatic pets,4
"We ordered this to make sure our cats stayed hydrated, They weren't particularly interested in it, but I don't blame the product for that. Our cat are weird. What was a problem was a noisy pump. It was somewhere between a hum and a low buzz, louder than most aquariums I've been around. Too much for 24 hour operation. It's also unnecessarily complex with quite a few parts, and though I didn't use it long enough to have to clean it, it looked like a chore. Removing and cleaning the pump regularly was recommended in the manual. Our waterer gets cleaned every couple days, and it only takes a couple minutes.",cats,2
Nothing has ever worked as well as this brush. Even my cat is happy!,cats,2
"I just received the Large Lounger bed and was disappointed to find the cover didn't zip off, nor was it big and fluffy as mentioned in two of the previous reviews.I called PetSupply to make sure I had received the correct bed, which, according to the helpful man I spoke to, did. Perhaps I misunderstood the review where the cover zips off. Maybe it 'zips' off, meaning it can be removed quickly, as opposed to having a cover with a zip!(?) It certainly isn't big and fluffy, etiher, as one reviewer said. It is made of orthopaedic grade foam, which doesn't appear to look as though it will support my 65lb Boxer, but he is now lounging quite happily on it! I do have a bed with polyester fill underneath the foam bed, to add comfort, which I used with his last bed. Only time will tell if the foam holds up. Maybe in 2 months I'll write another review.This is not to say I am disappointed with the bed, as it is too early to say, just that I was disappointed with the reviews that prompted me into buying it.So be aware, it is not big and fluffy; it is the size specified, 36"" x 24"" x 7"" (which includes the bolster part) with a firm piece of sculpted foam and an elasticized cover that, like a bed sheet, tucks under the 'mattress' part of the (dog) bed, enabling you to quickly remove it for washing.",dogs,3

"I have big dogs (Irish Wolfhounds) and the Gentle Leader encourages my puller to walk nicely on leash, even when separated from his brother. It gives me peace of mind when walking both dogs by myself that if they should see something and want to chase, I will not lose my grip on them.

"My dogs goal in life is to chew up and rip out every squeaker he can get his hands on. We bought the so called ""tough"" toys, not such luck. So we normal stick to 5.00 and under toys, as they are ruined in 2.2 seconds. Chevy has had ""Squirrly"" for 3 weeks and carries him around everywhere. He sleeps to him, he tosses him and he will mouth him. But he will not rip him apart. We have no idea why and if the makers of this toy know why please let us know. He protects this toy from our other dog. Best value and money we have ever spent on a toy. I might have to go get the rabbit and see if we get the same result.",dogs,3
"Better in than some, worse than others. The dial allows you to set the temperature and is good at keeping the temp. consistent which is great. However, aside from the actual heating is the construction. Because of its shape it will not work for a anything smaller than a 2.5 Mini Bow or for tanks w/o straight sides.This is not because you can't control the temp. finely enough, but because the large mounting piece needs to be above water, outside of the tank and attached to a straight edge. While the package does say non-submersible, I didn't think there would be so much of it that wasn't submersible, and the thumbnail for this isn't helpful at all. The water line is also very high. You will have to keep a careful eye on evaporation.Also, when the water temp. is close enough to cause the heater to shut off, there is a period of hesitation where the heater is almost on but not quite. When this happens, there is a buzzing sound. It reminds me of old horror movies when the characters turn on the bare bulb in the basement or in the defunct asylum.",fish aquatic pets,4

I bought the 13-22 Adjustable Wild West collar for my white German Shepherd and it looks great on him at a good price! I took him out for a walk and he got compliments about it. The collar is a durable nylon quality that feels like it'll last for years on my dog with regular use. It is stiff when I took it out of the package and is popping out a little bit after adjusting it to the appropriate size for my pup's neck but I'm sure it'll be softened out after he's wearing for a week. Lupine even guarantees a lifetime, even if chewed.",dogs,3
"I bought the Furminator with a very skeptical eye. I figuered it wouldn't break the bank so give it a try. I have a Corgi, thick undercoat, sheds like mad, especially in spring and fall. I decided today to give it a try. First pass over his coat I knew I had struck gold. In about 15 minutes I had gotten more loose fur off him than I used to get in at least an hour of hard work grooming wth other tools. Saved my back a lot of grief by getting it done so fast. It didn't do much for our short haired cat, I really think this is for thick undercoats. I am so happy that I will be able to keep my puppy looking his best without having to run him to the groomer constantly and spending a lot of money. Thank you Furminator.",cats,2

The only thing is that the squeakers didn't last more than ten minutes, and that's for all 3, but I don't mind because those things drive me nuts sometimes.

I've caught them eating out of simmering pots of food on the stove, eating raw potatoes/onions, chewing up my rubber gloves, chewing up my kitchen sponges, you name it and they try to eat it. They also lick dishes off the counter where they smash onto the floor. Or I should say the DID all that stuff, until I got the Instant Pet Barrier. I LOVE this thing! I didn't give it 5 stars b/c I wish the radius was bigger. I put the collars on the cats and within a few days they weren't even making their collars beep any more. The only issue I had was I put it on too tight on one of the cats and he lost some fur where the collar was rubbing, I loosened it, the hair grew back and things are great. They wear their collars 24/7, since I'm sure they're smart enough to know when they don't hear the beep they can go near the counters. I have been able to leave food on the counters and it remains unmolested. I have recommended this to all my friends with problem cats!",dogs,3
"Good price for the size, at least compared to where I can find it near me. And my cat's not barfing anymore.",cats,2
I did everything in my power to interest my cats in these toys to no avail. They won't look twice at them. I'm really disappointed too as I had read some really good reviews on this product. There's a certain smell to the toy that they don't seem to care for. I'm not sure what it is. It's like a factory smell. Maybe that's why they don't seem to care for it. I've tried airing out the springs but that doesn't seem to have helped either. Either I have three very weird cats or these toys aren't all they're cut out to be.,cats,2
"I gave this three stars because it did decrease my boston terrier's barking, but not enough. At night, she hardly barks and when she does, the barking doesn't last long. But during the day if the neighbor is out and about, she'll start barking and barking over and over and I wonder if the collar even works right. I test the collar and it seems like it takes a lot of shaking to get the thing to light up. All in all because of the collar she doesn't bark at night so much anymore which is satisfactory. I think it would actually work better if my dog wasn't so possessed.",dogs,3

"I bought this toy for my 9 yr old Soft-Coated Wheaton for Christmas. He is an aggressive chewer (surprisingly) and usually destroys plush toys pretty quickly. He can't quite figure out how to get the eggs out, but because the toy is so extra plush because of all the stuffed eggs inside, he has not torn it apart! He has great fun with it playing fetch and tug of war. I will definitely buy more egg babies in future.",dogs,3

"catit; Drinking Fountain and Accessories for CatsThis fountain is GREAT! I have two cats, one was diagnosed with bladder stones shortly after I got the second one. The vet said I needed to add salt to the cat food and make water available. Well, it's really hard to get a cat to drink more, but this fountain did it! Both cats can drink out of it, so there is no competition issues, it is really easy to clean, (I clean it once a month), when it makes noises you just add more water to the basin, not the dome. I've seen no mold, and the filter catches all the cat hair (which is minimal). I have two short haired cats, but I guess if you have long haired ones clogging may be more of a problem. The motor still works and I've had the fountain for almost a year now. Is is really easy to set up and even though I put the fountain on carpet you just have to tilt the dome to ensure good water coverage and then the water flow takes care of itself. Great product!",cats,2
"We currently have four always indoors cats, we have had as many as six at one time. We have owned as many as two Litter Maids at one time and experienced the same problem with all of them. First the solid waste sticks to the forks and is difficult to clean. Second the trays are expensive and messy to change. I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve, but at over $1.00 each they are still too much.We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it. It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone. We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one. With the ninety-day money-back guarantee you have nothing to loose and I believe you will not want to return it.See my full review of the Scoop Free by going to the product or my clicking on ""See all of my review"" link here.",cats,2

I could do without the red logo, but this leash does the job.

The cord retractables retract more quickly and reliably. But all in all this is a very good leash.",dogs,3

"I have been a fairly happy owner of the littermaid for about 6 years. Now over this time I replaced it a few times when the odor just could not be removed from it. It was time to buy a new one and I saw the reviews for the latest models saying they had ruined a pretty good product. But I saw some nice comments about the Litter-robot so I decided it give it a try.I don't know what I have done all these years but I wish I had known about this cat box before. I am not one to sit and write reviews for products I buy but this one compelled me to tell you about how great a catbox this is and that all the other reviews are not overblown hyperbole. This thing does what it says it does. It has no smell and it is so easy to get rid of the poop-filled bags. I went to the store and bought a box of 13 gallon wastepaper bags for $2.39 and I am now set for half a year of baggie supplies. Soooo much cheaper than those plastic boxes of the littermaid. And it seems to use much less litter (I use Nature's Miracle).Now I have to admit that one of my cats took a few days to get used to it and after a couple of accidents I was thinking about sending it back. But I just put his ""accident"" in the box and he got the message and used it the next time (ok, so I did set up a chair next to the box and coaxed him along). But everyone is happy now and the house smells great. This is a solid machine that looks like it could last for years and is well worth the money.",cats,2
"We use these for our rescue and they are great for sleeping quarters for babies of many kinds and Cavy in waiting for their forever homes while in foster care for the price. We add shelves to these by adding ready made wire shelf units with add smooth top out of flooring since the cage manufacturer no longers gives perching shelves with this cage. They use to include one in years back. The hay rack is useless so plan on buy a good one. We use the included hay rack to catch hay from the real hay rack we add in the cage. The door latches are iffy but work but often pop off and slide is not smooth. There are some pretty bad cages out there these days and these have good materials in them. Gauge of the wire is excellent. My main complaint is Seacorals does not ship the same color cage even when you order one color on the same order. Thus a messy looking stack of mismatched cages or we have out swap cages so fosterhomes can have a ""clean look"" matching set if they need 2. I order 2 cages and get 2 different colors. Really Sea Corals why would you do that? There appears to be no way to get Seacorals to comply with the color ordered unless you want to ship back the cages. They also open the cages and repackage them in very bad boxes. The UPS delivery guy and I stood shaking our heads over the horrible packaging job and were amazed we could see the whole cage through the box. That be said it does show the cage is strong as the packaging on all orders has been so badly done the cage construction - materials is the only thing that got the cage here in one piece. Cage is good and there is little else out there at this price that compares. Seacorals is responsive in filling your order which is good but it may not get there in the color you asked for. I actually like both colors they have shipped but wanted consistancy. If you are shipping random colors you should tell people that on Amazon. You should also look in on the person packing these for you.",birds,0
"My lab mix dog's coat was dull and flaky. Our vet recommended adding salmon oil to her food. I checked reviews and Alaskan Bear Treats was well recommended by others.

"I am very optimistic and I followed the directions to the T, but it's been 3 months and we are STUCK on the last ring! My baby Roux has no problem going #1 but when she has to go #2 we have issues! She will jump onto the seat, walk around, look up at me and meow (she's thinking ""you're really gonna make me do this?!?"") jump down, scratch the floor and repeat! Eventually she will go on the toilet BUT sometimes the water splashes up and startles her. Occasionally, when i am not home, she will have an accident and go on the floor, or the bath mat if we tried to put one in the bathroom.It has been a very long process and we only have 1 bathroom and frankly, myself and 2 roommates are super annoyed at having to remove the ring every time WE have to go #2. Plus we have people over every weekend and they just think it's gross.

"As with other buyers, I've found that this product leaves an oily residue on my cat's fur more than a week after it's application. It also made her very sick the second time it was used, mainly because there's so much of it in one vial that it spreads down her skin and fur to where she reach to can lick it. Have you ever seen bright green vomit? That's what she brought up. Flea control seems to be achieved but the side effects make me question the propriety of using this product on either of my cats (the male, fortunately, is able to wear a 6-month flea collar to which the female is allergic). They're the same age, 7 years, so I'm not discussing kittens. I will not use this product again and have already ordered Frontline Plus. I know it works and I know my cat has no adverse reaction to it. This is a case where trying to save a few dollars cost me more in the long run.",cats,2
"I am the proud father of 5 Canine Daughters (actually they are Gender Neutral). All of my girls are large with the smallest being an Australian Kelpie weighing about 50 pounds of solid muscle to the largest being my Blood Hound / Lab Mix who weighs about 130 lbs. I also have a Border Collie, a German Shephard and a Norwegian Elkhound. All 5 of my Canine Daughters are kept in our home.My Norwegian Elkhound is 15 1/2 years old and she began having trouble with our all wooden foyer steps about a year ago. I had already purchased two of these harnesses to have available as our next door neighbors very large dog 140 lbs + was also getting up there in age and showing signs of at times having difficulty getting on her feet.We helped our neighbor with her dog and she found this harness to be invaluable. Since that time, sadly our neighbors dog has passed away. Now, our Norwegian Elkhound has begun using this harness. She actually suffered some type of injury to her spine as a result of losing her footing on the steps when she was coming down them by herself. Within 2 days of the injury, she was completely unable to walk and showed no signs of any reflex in any of her feet when tested by her doctor. I was very afraid that this was the end of the line for my beloved Wolfie.The Vet put her on steroids for one week and I added the antioxidant treats called Nzymes to her daily pill regimen of the natural medicine Flavocin. Once the steroids reduced the swelling in her spine, she was once again able to show reflexes in her feet but she was still unable to walk and she could not get herself to her feet. By using this harness to help her get up and take 90% of her body weight off of her legs, over the course of 1 week, I was able to get her slowly walking again. Now, having worked with her daily, exactly four weeks after her injury, Wolfie has begun climbing the steps on her own, which I would prefer she would wait for me to assist her. But, she is very strong willed and this harness along with the natural medicines have gotten her walking better than she has in more than a year.Also, I have had 4 spine surgeries myself and I have to be extremely careful about picking up items, etc. Before the harness, I was picking up squirming dogs which was very hard on my back. Now with the harness, not only does it help her walk and even taught her to walk again, it reduces the strain I put on my back caring for my wonderful canine companions.The harness is so well designed that Wolfie wears hers all of the time and doesn't mind it at all. Obviously it is comfortable or she wouldn't keep it on without a fuss because she has always been very picky about most things in her life and never wanted her feet touched, didn't like her ears petted, etc. She wears the harness daily and I give equal credit to the harness and the natural medicines for why I have her with me today. It should be noted that I have had her on Flavocin Pills for over two years, which I believe is a large part of why she is still with me today.If you have a need to assist your larger dog with either getting to it's feet, walking or climbing stairs, etc., then this harness will not disappoint you.If you find yourself needing this harness for your canine companion, look at it as an opportunity to help rehabilitate your pet's health if at all possible, instead of seeing the need for a device like this as the beginning of the end. Your dog might just surprise you and with your help, regain some of it's independence, which would be great for both of you.One last point, in the product photo, the German Shepard is on the right side of the person climbing the stairs. I would STRONGLY suggest that you put yourself immediately next to the handrail so that you can balance yourself and have your pet go up the other side of you, or more towards the center of the steps. I am right handed but I use my left hand to help Wolfie up the stairs so that I can safely balance myself with my right hand. Coming down the steps it is just the opposite where I end up using my right hand to hold the harness and my left hand on the stair railing.I will gladly answer any questions where I can be of assistance.",cats,2
"I used this bedding with my hamster and I believe it made her sick and eventually killed her. She developed sneezing and sniffles and labored breathing, and I couldn't figure out why. I took her to the vet twice, and they didn't know what the problem was. I researched it on the internet and couldn't find anything. It was strange because sometimes she seemed better with her breathing problems and other times worse and I just couldn't figure it out. She died after six months with this problem at a year and a half old.We recently got a rabbit and I used our hamster's bedding that I had left from the Carefresh bag. I noticed that my rabbit sneezed once or twice, but didn't think much of it. I was researching rabbit bedding and found this about CareFresh on www.raising-rabbits.com website",bunny rabbit central,1

"Both of my animals were suffering from that ""hot spot"" problem above the tail but my dog's problem was so bad she was licking and chewing herself bloody. It had been a problem off-and-on for years. I used (and continue to) Advantage, Frontline, etc. to combat fleas and a limited ingredient diet. I also tried special shampoo's & conditioners, Omega 3's, Salmon oil, olive oil, etc. but nothing helped. Finally in a last-ditch attempt at a cure I found BioCoat and figured it was worth a shot. It was a totally different approach. It bordered on the miraculous as my dog was completely healed and happy after a few weeks. I kept her on it till the bottle ran out (about 3 months) and haven't had to order again until this summer when I've noticed she's starting to get ""itchy"". It's been almost two years since her first treatment. As for my cat, it completely cured her ""hot spot"" and mellitus dermatitis. She still looks great after the same time period.

She constantly brings it to me to toss and play tug-a-war with. It has held up great. If your dog destroys a toy especially a PLUSH toy that does not make the toy bad but it does make your dog destructive. If you have a dog that destroys things buy it KONG toys. Only bad thing is you dog will not like them, as they can't destroy them. Most of the time a dog like this is frustrated because it is trapped at your house and can not walk around the neighborhood and mark its territory. If you are not walking you dog daily all is smells is other dog's scents and feels its territory is being violated. Most dogs if walked around the block once per day will change their behavior drastically for the better. You have to understand how important it is for a dog to march around its territory to feel proud and respected. Try and see the difference.",dogs,3

One of my original feeders broke after having it for 5+ years (it actually probably could have been fixed, the battery connection got loose, but decided to get a new set and keep one of the old ones as a backup).

I don't think this can possibly keep her from her diet by THAT much. The fact that it doesn't rely on batteries is great. If the power goes out, there is something in it that keeps it going that I've never had to change.I just wish it were a little less expensive.",cats,2

"I bought the equivalent of the CSF back in 2001, and it's still going strong in 2008. I made my own mount and hooked it up to the timer I wanted to use. It kept my overweight cat from bugging me for food, since the superfeeder was now his source for food. It helped my cat lose weight so that his food could be distributed in smaller meals throughout the day. I am so grateful for the feeder's design and reliability. The business owner, Gerard, of this great product, gives top notch service, excellent instructions for the feeder's use, and a wonderful product that he makes improvements to as added benefits. When a friend of mine needed a feeder for his cats, I bought the CSF model in 2007 which had some improvements over the model I have, and it works great too. Gerard put a small half cover on the front of the CSF feeder because I let him know that one of the cats was crafty at getting her paw up into the feeder. That kept the cat from getting food out by shoving her paw up the dispenser shaft. The most the cat can now do is body slam the feeder and shake out a piece or two of kibble. I would highly recommend this product.",cats,2

"Finally! My cat had been eating k/d diet both wet and dry for years. Suddenly she lost interest in the canned and I was forced to add sardines to it. Sort of defeats the purpose of limiting the protein doesn't it? Well, I was heartsick because already thin to begin with, she wasn't eating enough to gain weight. She would just sit and stare at her bowl. In desperation, I knew I had to find a better food, so I read the reviews here and ordered a case and voila! She eats it without sauce or sardines. She can't get enough of it. I had to order another case. So now she's eating one can a day which is good. Though I wish they would make this in a dry too, so she could nibble through the night. She won't even touch the dry anymore! And we all know what a wet diet can do to the teeth. I highly recommend a dental treat such as enzadent oral chews and a daily cleaning or adding a dental additive to the water. But I shouldn't complain, she's eating and that's what I wanted. Anyway, I don't know what they put in this food, but my cat sure likes it and thanks to it, she's going to be around for a long time still!",cats,2

"I bought this after a trip to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, where I took a class in cat grooming. They used these almost exclusively and raved about them. My cats enjoy being brushed with these much better than the wire brushes, because they're soft enough to go over the joints and backbone without poking or scraping, yet they are excellent at pulling out those loose undercoat hairs. I have a shorthaired cat who throws up hairballs regularly and regular brushing with the Zoom Groom has greatly reduced the number of surprises on the floor. The only thing I would caution is that if your cat (or dog) likes to chew, put this out of reach when not in use! I had a foster cat who happily chewed the ears right off of this! :)",cats,2

I thought she'd love this, as I wanted to put it exactly where she usually &#34;grooms&#34; her whiskers, however she doesn't really go near it much, not that I've seen. I'm not blaming the weak mounting stick'ems they put in the box, but my cat was somewhat interested when we first put it up for her, and after it fell, she hasn't touched it. We've since gotten better quality mounting tape and really stuck it to the wall well...however, I think she's over it.Good product, though. Well made, nice brushes.",cats,2

"Highly recommend. I use K9 Advantix on all 3 of my dogs. I really noticed the difference going from spring into summer this year. Before I used the first application, I was finding lots of ticks on the dogs. As soon as I used this product, the ticks went away. It protects from more things than the competitors (like Frontline).",dogs,3
"There are many micro/macro nutrients in this substrate, so I don't need to add plant tabs for a long time (1-2 months). Plants that rely on roots to obtain its' nutrients will do well in these substrate. I have many amazon sword plants in my aquarium and they kept dying. After I changed the substrate, they stop turning yellow and their color recovered.Another pro is that the dark color makes the aquarium looks amazing. Fish have brighter colors, plants have brighter colors and it looks very natural.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I bought this being skeptical because our pups are like children. I used it on myself before I put it on my dog. It gives a slight jolt but didn't hurt, just surprised me and shut off my wind pipe making it impossible to make noise. I put it on my dog occasionally but he has learned. He barked once with it on and never again. Although he has learned that he can growl or do a light bark to get around it, it is no where near what his normal bark is. I would recommend this to others. I use it on a 15lb shitzu mix",dogs,3
My cat SEEsee would always scoop her food out of her bowl and toss it around the kitchen. Her playfulness would usually end in her and my disappointment as the food would fly under the fridge. Now with the Food Ball she is able to get in playtime and once the food is dispersed she gobbles it up without flinging it under the fridge.,cats,2

"I got these treats because we needed chewy treats that our soft-coated wheaten terrier puppy could eat quickly during training. We had a lot of the cookie type treats earlier but it took too long for him to break apart the dry treats and lick up the crumbs. He'd also run around having only half-swallowed the treat and I worried about him choking. These treats were recommended to me by a friend and they have solved these problems.PROS-- Our dog loves these treats. LOVES them. Mostly because they are so moist and chewy.-- Even though they are chewy, the treats don't leave any residue on your hands or anything-- they are very clean.-- quick and easy to chew. Seems to be a lot less unhealthy than many other treats out there.-- definitely gets him to pay attention!CONS-- you have to be careful of leaving the bag open as the treats can dry out, although I think you can put a damp napkin in and re-hydrate the treats.-- These are a little too expensive for regular use, especially if you have a bigger dog.Our dog is medium sized and it is easy to go through these treats pretty quickly. Then again, you really need treats that a dog will go wild for, and these do the trick. Overall, these are great treats that we'd recommend to anyone that is looking for high quality dog treats. When he finishes his training for the day we toss a small handful of these around he floor and let him hunt them all down (he is a terrier so he loves it!).",dogs,3
"Well, it was GREAT while it lasted. About an hour. Which is the case with all of these toys with the sound boxes in them. It is very unfortunate that the companies don't find a way to better protect these boxes. I mean, they do realize that they are making these for DOGS, don't they??? Dogs with teeth???!!!???I do have a couple of other toys with the sound boxes that are still going strong, but they just say things like ""Ribbit"" and ""Cock a Doodle Do"". Nothing as exciting as this one!!!!Anyway, I ordered this one because one of the reviews said that this one lasted his dog for a long time for some reason. I thought ""GREAT! Just what I'm looking for"". He said he had a large dog (like me). Well, I unfortunately did not have the same experience. I must say that my dog loved this toy so much for the hour that it worked though. His eye's went almost crossed with excitement everytime that song would play! LOL If they weren't so expensive, I would order another one, even knowing that it would only last an hour. But for the price I paid, I just cannot do that. I will keep an eye to see if the price comes down, and then we'll see.",dogs,3

"I should have trusted the other reviews. Great idea and my mini dachshund loves it, maybe too much. He's completely destroyed it in less than a day. Good idea, poor materials. If a 13 pound mini dachshund can chew this to bits any dog can and likely will. Somewhat dangerous too my if they swallow the bits the chew off. I never thought of my dog as a vigorous chewer before, but if there's food involved I guess he is.",dogs,3
"I bought this filter upon the addition of a figure eight puffer to my community/semi aggressive tank. They're known for being rather messy eaters, leaving shrimp bits all over the place, so I decided to go for overkill and get the 30 for my 10-gallon tank. It is wonderful! My water readings have gotten better even though I have the puffer and I've had crystal clear water. Changing the filter cartridge is easy and you can choose what filter media you want to use. I used the included carbon, sponge, and bio-filter but I might replace the carbon with Purigen later on.Either way, it works great, it's easy to install, and it looks pretty neat (it's clear!). The transparent plastic also helps with keeping up on filter cleaning and a quick look will tell you if it's dirty.Also, way cheaper on Amazon than at pet stores.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I trusted the reviews and tried this, and it works like a charm. I highly recommend it, and the price is worth it.I have two low-level litter boxes because one of my cats hates higher walled boxes. So, I tried this stuff in one box and the regular brand in another. Both my cats, 14 and 15 years old, used Cat Attract almost exclusively.My Siamese male is totally fastidious, and he used to cry on the box, then do the Siamese freak out run around the house afterward. That has almost stopped. I think he was trying to tell me he hated the old litter.My domestic shorthair female is heavy, and she would go on the edge of the box to keep from touching the litter too much. She has not done that once since I started using this litter.I would recommend trying this stuff - your cats will thank you by using it.",cats,2
Nice product. A little bit flimsy for a large dog. Delivered as described. My dog doesn't like it. He doesn't like being elevated above the floor. Nothing wrong with it.,dogs,3
This has been very easy for our kitten to use. The only downside is the holes you are supposed to punch out I needed to use a utility knife to cut it out.(not very easy) We have only the first hole out at the moment but our kitten has been doing very well. I will be removing the next hole in another week. It is so much easier to clean and no litter smell!! Big Plus!! I would reccomend this for anyone trying to train their kitten.,cats,2

"I have two dogs- a 5lb Chihuahua and a 20lb Jack Russell terrier and they both LOVE these chew toys. I got a larger one once for the bigger dog but she prefers the small or 'petite' size. My chihuahua's teeth were in rotten shape because her mouth is too small and her baby teeth won't fall out, so her baby teeth and her adult teeth are all in there at once, and she can't have dental surgery because she has kidney issues, and these chew toys have really helped. She even knocked out a couple of baby teeth from chewing on these, and they really help with plaque build up. My Jack Russell has great teeth and I think that these toys help keep her teeth in beautiful shape. They chew on them every single day and if I don't have enough around the house they will fight over them, so I usually have six out at once to avoid fights. I also like the pink ones because I can find them more easily on the floor or in the bed where the dogs leave them. The prices I have found on Amazon recently have raised though- that is the only negative. They can be found elsewhere for less, although I do love Amazon for the convenience of ordering and their customer service.",dogs,3
"I have a very high strung 1 year old lab mix. Any time I got her out she would have to be on a leash, otherwise she would be jumping up on my young children. I would have a hard time getting her into to her kennel. After a day or two with the sportdog trainer she was a different dog. The remote has 8 settings but I've never gone above 3. She loves the freedom of being off the leash, she never jumps up anymore and will go into her kennel easily. I always put her collar on when I get her out but I haven't had to correct her in quite somtime.",dogs,3

We recently got an 80 lb rescue, shepherd collie mix, and after two weeks of working with her she was still pulling out my arm every time she saw a squirrel or hoped to see one. I put the harness on her and she stopped after about 100 feet into the first walk wearing it. Her harness, by the way, a M/L, was the perfect size.",dogs,3
"Having two dogs is a problem enough but when you have to take them outside to so their business and taking some bags to pick it up does cause some annoyances especially when your low on plastic bags. These bags are just as sturdy as any of the plastic bags I've used before and a lot less prone to having holes(Which I appreciate after having some disgusting accidents when trying to pick up dog poop with a torn bag before) the bags are a little on the small side so if you have a dog bigger than a terrier than I suggest seeing if they sell a bigger size for these poop bags. I say this one is a good trial pack for anyone unsure about this product still like I was at first but you'll be as surprised as I was at how sturdy and how well they actually worked, and after you near the end of this package you can always get the 300 to 700 bag order which I've done as soon as I was finished with this package(Though I just say get the 700 bag order since the cost difference between the 300 to 700 is only about $5.00 dollars)...",dogs,3
"This crate has worked out really well for our Rhodesian Ridgeback. We drape towels or blankets over it so it is more like a den for him. Despite its significant size, it breaks down and actually rolls to a degree. We take it when visiting friends and relatives and its become a safe and comfortable place for our dog to rest. It is well built and affordable especially when compared to the competition. The Amazon pricing including shipping is great. Some people and breeders seem to prefer the plastic crates but this crate breaks down easier and allows for good ventilation on hot days.",dogs,3

"I have purchased the Dr. Noy's Extra small bear, small rabbit, and medium lamb from Amazon. I have a smallish breed - he's a pup at around 10 lbs and should max out at around 15. His favorite of his animals is by far his medium sized lamb. He carries it with him everywhere. He has managed to put some holes in all three of his Dr. Noy's, so they definitely aren't indestructible, but they are very sturdy. He is teething currently and they are withstanding that phase for the most part. The medium has an advantage of having a designated pouch inside the toy for the squeaker that the extra small and small didn't have. It makes the toy a little bulkier in the middle and adds some extra popping protection for the squeaker. Great toy!",dogs,3
"We actually bought this carrier because one of our cats was terrified of his carrier, so I researched what to do, and the first thing was to get a carrier that was top loading. After working with him for weeks on end by setting him in and letting him jump out immediately, and also just by keeping the carrier in the living room with the front door open at all times so he could go in and out as he pleased, (plus several other things), we were finally able to take a trip to the Vet without a total meltdown.We liked this one so much that we bought another one, since we have more than one cat and found that having a top loader made it so much easier to extract the cats when they don't want to come out, like when they are at the Vet! One of our cats weighs 16 lbs, and he still fits quite comforably in this carrier.My only issue is that I sometimes have a problem getting the front door to latch into place.",dogs,3
"We were desperate to reduce the cat hair in the house and Chlorine (rescued from a swimming pool 8 years ago) HATED the metal comb. A friend recommended the Furminator so I went to a pet shop to buy one...$50! The groomer in the pet store quietly suggested that I check online prices before I purchased it. God bless her...$20 through Amazon! This tool is amazing in the amount of hair it removes. Chlorine even feels different, softer. And, even though she's a little cranky, she tolerates the Furminator for quite a while before she's had enough. I definitely see a difference in the amount of cat hair in the house; a great purchase.",cats,2
"Our 9 year old lab has some bad ACL issues in both his knees. Before giving him this, he would constantly limp around. We started giving him 2 pills a day and within a couple weeks his limp was almost gone! We cut back to 1 pill a day after a month and he's still much better than before. He'll still limp now and then, but I think the only thing that would fix that is $5,000 surgery. The pills are a great fix that still allows our lab to run around and live his life without the risk and cost of surgery.Amazon is MUCH cheaper than the vet and anywhere else we could find.",dogs,3

This file allows me to reach where the grinder cannot to help with this. The file has what I would call a medium to light roughness and takes a few passes to really file the nail. It also has a sort of ""U"" shape, where the sides both curve in on one side of the file. This helps for getting the whole tip of the nail. It works, so no complaints.",cats,2

"We adopted a very large Alaskan Malamute, Nannuq, from a young couple who could no longer care for him. The only training he had was he would sit on command and go to his crate on command. An unlike most Alaskan Malamutes this one is a barker much to our surprise. We hired a trainer to help us get control of him and she was the one who got us this Gentle Spray Citronella Collar. And....it worked. Before the collar, we could not put the dog in the 12 foot by 12 foot kennel we have (and our last Alaskan Malamute was perfectly content out there watching the world go by). This dog, Nannuq, would bark and howl. People could hear him on the next block (and we live in the country)! We started to use the collar and now Nannuq stays in his kennel without barking and lays on the deck without barking. Sometimes we put the collar on him and forget to turn it on and he still doesn't bark! We are so happy with this product that we just ordered from Amazon the remote gentle shock collar (which sprays a burst of citronella when the remote control is pushed). We are hoping this will help us to keep him from stealing items on the kitchen and bathroom counters, leave my outside plants alone, and in general behave better. Stay tuned for review! One last thing, it is important to remember to always turn the collar to off when not in use. The batteries will not last long if you forget to do this.",dogs,3

Although, you can tell when it is time to refill it because she begins to meow more and starts grooming again. This is amazing stuff, but it is expensive. We made a commitment to provide a forever home to this kitty so it was either pay some money for feliway or have a bald cat.",cats,2

She is 9 1/2 inches tall and can see over the sides and out the front window while sitting down.What I enjoy the most is I can unbuckle it from the back of the seat with one hand while sitting in the driver seat, I can then just flip it over the headreast when someone wants to ride in the passenger seat. Then it just lays back down in place. Very easy to use!The vented sides allow air circulation and the front blocks the direct air from hitting her in the face if she lays down. It has a little pocket on the front where I store her little water tray and chew toy.She really likes riding in it and doesn't fall off of the arm rest any more.

"We have two large dogs, a golden retriever and a german shepherd mix. The groomer said it was going to cost $75 each to give them their customary summer shear. My wife spent 6 years working in vet clinics during school, and said Oster makes the best clipper out there - she looked at all of the options out there, and settled on these - which cost less than one trip to the groomer for both dogs would have. On Sunday morning she set about the process of clipping both dogs - and was done with both of them in less than 45 minutes. We have tried other cheaper clippers in the past, with limited success and maximum frustration. These clippers have two speeds, making them very versatile. They are quiet to operate, ergonomically sensitive and are not uncomfortably warm to the touch, even after extended operation (some heat is to be expected with ANY clipper.) The cord is of a more than adequate length, and the switch is simple to operate, even with your hands full. They cut through our golden's dense undercoat like butter - never once getting stuck or clogged and never pulling at the hair, even where it was slightly matted. These clippers made for a stress-free grooming experience all around, and left both dogs much cooler and happier.",cats,2

This should not be advertised as a durable and tough toy, or at least it should be revised for bigger dogs. I called the company and they were great, told me to send it back for a full refund.

"It's not that I mind her being happy, it's just that I'm a little melancholy that she doesn't need me so much anymore. The Petmate has been working reliably well in the four weeks that we've owned it. In spite of the instructions that came in the package, warning that my pet might become ""territorial"" and ""growl"" at people who came near her new feeder, my cat has shown none of these signs.The Petmate was easy enough to program--it has settings to feed three times a day, at several different quantity levels. Since I give our girl canned food instead of dry food in the morning, I simply set the first ""feeding"" of dry food from the Petmate at 8:00am for ""0"" food, so that nothing happens. Then, in order to make sure she had fresh food served to her a couple more times during the day (I wanted 8 hour increments), I set the next two feedings for 4:00pm and 11:59pm. I didn't take the time to figure out how to get past the fact that the third feeding must be a PM setting. Perhaps others will see a way to set it to better advantage. This way worked fine for me.",cats,2

I microwave it at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily, which seems to be adequate. I've recommended the product to several friends and will certainly, when needed, buy another for myself ! I'm trying to retain website information for future use !! Thank you ...Kathryn",cats,2
"Another great item I have gotten from Amazon. I have one cat and needed a way to still let him use his litter box but not have the ugly thing showing. So I purchased this. Love it. The product holds most of the smell in and you can barely tell there is a box in it. (as with any pet must clean box everyday!) The top two levels are also great for storage. Now I use it for my fish tank on top and store all of my fish product items in the bottom. My cat has a new place for his litter box. Either way, excellent idea!",cats,2
"We have a 7 y/o Border Collie who's had problems with his right leg where it joins to his hip, ever since we adopted him at the age of 2.5 years. He would favor his right side, and sometimes drag his leg along as he ran across the yard. A couple of weeks ago, we noticed that our furry family member was slower at getting up, couldn't jump up on our bed anymore, did not want to play, or chase after deer. We could tell that he was distressed, and in pain as he would whimper while trying to move around. I had heard of Glucosamine and Chondroitin for pets, but I was searching for something that also contained MSM. This product has all three, plus added vitamins for support. We started giving our dog, two tablets a day - once in the morning, and once in the evening. These are chewable, so he believes he's getting a treat. About three days after starting him on these tablets; we noticed our dog was more active, and no longer whimpered in pain. A week later, and he's active as a puppy. He doesn't seem to be in any pain. We will continue to give him these tablets, reducing the dose to once a day. Our dog will take one of these tablets once a day for the rest of his beautiful life! Thank you for offering such a great product!",dogs,3

Or maybe our cat just pees way too much!",cats,2
"These are the best scratching posts I have tested on my cat household. Smaller cats (especially if de-clawed) may not be able to jump onto the top, but they are still able to fully stretch out when they scratch. It gets plenty of use from de-clawed cats, too. I've never seen it tip over, even when used by the largest cat, a tall, long, 17# boy. He climbs up on top, and launches himself from it, and it has never fallen (In truth, it wobbles a little on those occasions, but never gets knocked over!). It's tall enough for most cats to completely stretch out when scratching, and it has held up very well for 3 years so far! I don't have the cushion for the top, so the wood has been scratched up on the top, especially in the corners, but the actual scratching material is holding up very well. I recommend this to every cat owner I know, even if your cat is de-clawed, it's still very beneficial for them to do the scratching and stretching behavior on something like this. And it has definitely saved some furniture!",cats,2

"We have a yellow Lab who sheds year around to some degree. The Furminator has helped a great deal in controlling for the loose hairs that used to drop all over the house.

"This product nearly killed my 5 month old mastiff. I purchased the ""Souper"" size based on his weight of approx. 85 lbs. Since he was only 5 months old, how was I to know that the ""strong chewer"" category would apply to him? I was also under the impression, based on the product description, that any pieces he could chew off would be the size of a grain of rice and would certainly pass through his system. I did monitor his chewing and fortunately I am able to pull the bone out of his mouth while he's chewing to check it. I also noticed small rice size pieces on the floor around him as well. Each time I checked, the end was bristled . . . which is what it is reported to do. I had no idea he was ingesting large chunks until he threw up several times and I found a total of seven 1"" long by "" wide pieces of plastic! After x-rays and surgery, an additional 3 large pieces were found in his stomach. Fortunately, they had not passed through to his intestines yet. The thought of what could have happened is very frightening. It disturbs me to think how many other dogs have suffered or died without their owners realizing what happened. After telling people my story, I'm shocked to hear how often this has happened to others. Don't take the risk!",dogs,3

"Adult rabbits (one year and older) need a timothy based rabbit food-not alfalfa. Timothy hay should be the top ingredient. This stuff is really expensive- for the same price you could get Oxbow which is probably considered the highest quality rabbit food available. Also, sunflower or any other seeds can be dangerous for rabbits.[...]What are the basics of a good house rabbit diet?A rabbit's diet should be made up of good quality pellets, fresh hay (alfalfa, timothy or oat), water and fresh vegetables. Anything beyond that is a ""treat"" and should be given in limited quantities.What makes a good pellet?Pellets should be fresh, and should be relatively high in fiber (18% minimum fiber). Do not purchase more than 6 weeks worth of feed at a time, as it will become spoiled. Pellets should make up less of a rabbit's diet as he or she grows older, and hay should be available 24 hours a day.What kinds of veggies should I feed my rabbit?When shopping for vegetables , look for a selection of different veggies--look for both dark leafy veggies and root vegetables, and try to get different colors. Stay away from beans and rhubarb. Here's a suggested veggie list.Is feeding hay important?Hay is essential to a rabbit's good health, providing roughage which reduces the danger of hairballs and other blockages. Apple tree twigs also provide good roughage.What quantities of food should I feed babies and ""teenagers""?Birth to 3 weeks--mother's milk3 to 4 weeks--mother's milk, nibbles of alfalfa and pellets4 to 7 weeks--mother's milk, access to alfalfa and pellets7 weeks to 7 months--unlimited pellets, unlimited hay (plus see 12 weeks below)12 weeks--introduce vegetables (one at a time, quantities under 1/2 oz.)What quantities of food should I feed young adults? (7 months to 1 year)introduce timothy hay, grass hay, and oat hays, decrease alfalfadecrease pellets to 1/2 cup per 6 lbs. body weightincrease daily vegetables graduallyfruit daily ration no more than 1 oz. to 2 oz. per 6 lbs. body weight (because of calories)What quantities of food should I feed mature adults? (1 to 5 years)Unlimited timothy, grass hay, oat hay, straw1/4 to 1/2 cup pellets per 6 lbs. body weight (depending on metabolism and/or proportionate to veggies)Minimum 2 cups chopped vegetables per 6 lbs. body weightfruit daily ration no more than 2 oz. (4 TBL) per 6 lbs. body weight.What quantities of food should I feed senior rabbits? (Over 6 years)If sufficient weight is maintained, continue adult dietFrail, older rabbits may need unrestricted pellets to keep weight up. Alfalfa can be given to underweight rabbits, only if calcium levels are normal. Annual blood workups are highly recommended for geriatric rabbits.",bunny rabbit central,1
"I got this to keep my kittens away from the front door so they wouldn't try to dart out when I come and go. It works pretty well, and has done the job. The cats definitely don't like it, and have learned to avoid it. It's a little hard to tell where it can ""see"" though. Sometimes one of my cats walks right up to it and it doesn't go off. Other times, it sees one of them several meters away and goes off for no reason. It also goes off if I open the oven door, since it's infra-red activated. I've also used it to keep them off counters. A little annoying when I forget it's on and set it off myself, but that's not really the device's fault.I would recommend this product to cat owners who need to keep their cats away from counters, doors, cables, etc.",cats,2

"I am relatively new to the hobby of fish keeping and I have spent months learning about water parameters and chemistry. Most of the experts highly recommend using the water that comes from your tap (and I tried buying RO water for awhile and that was a pain in the BUTT!) and so I have started doing just that. (Again-the idea is to raise fish that will thrive in your water without having to tamper with the PH, KH & GH--unless you are an expert) That being said, I could not find fish that would love being in water with a PH of 9.9 or higher! (And YES, I have confirmed this with the water report for my water district...) That being said, I read many reviews and articles on using Neutral Regulator. I am by no means obsessed with a perfect PH of 7 as much as a PH that is stable and livable for my fish and Neutral Regulator has helped me do this. This is a good price and with Prime's free shipping and no tax, it is a great deal.**UPDATE",fish aquatic pets,4

"Cat (Lily) loves it. She drinks tons more water since I have gotten it.The cleaning can take a while but once done it last for two weeks or more. I think the reason is I have a water softner and that helps to keep the ""scale"" and buildup at bay. My sister has the same product and she has EXTREME hard water and her drinkwell looks awful due to scale and deposit that WILL NOT come off-no matter how often it is cleaned and scrubbed. The motor is VERY HARD to ""turn"" to get it out of the bottom to clean it. The first 3 times I had to have my husband get it out for me and he had to use a butter knife to get the thing to move out--but I understand why it has to be tight (otherwise there might be a leak) so I am ok with that.I have had mine now for a year and so far have had NO PROBLEMS. It still works good and no loss of power.Cost of filters are a little high so I try to make one work for quite a while before i change it. One filter can usually last three months for me -as long as I clean it once every two week and rinse filter really well each time.I have my sister's cat staying now for over two weeks and this original drinkwell is just not big enough for both. I have to add water DAILY. Scared to leave both cats for more than an 8 hour period due to not having enough water. I am thinking of getting a Drinkwell Big Dog to make sure I can leave for at least a 24 hour period.Overall, I am very happy with this product just wish water capacity was more. Even with just one cat I have to add water every other day-so the bottom line is--it is just not big enough.Oh -the sound as others has mentioned -is slight. I have it sitting on a rug (bought for $4 at discount store) and it muffles the sound slightly. The sound of water hitting the water is peaceful to me. It is right next to the living room and we have had NO problems with the sound at all.",cats,2

"The dispenser works pretty much as you would expect, but the plastic is pretty thin.

I FINALLY found an 800 number to call and asked if anything in the food came from China and they said no. However they did say that they ""removed"" a couple of things from the food.

I did add another piece of ortho foam between the pop corn mattress and the cedar pouch - and that's no small cedar pouch! It is the size of the product and smells great! I added the extra foam for extra support as the pop corn mattress is not as thick as I would have liked. As long as kitties are happy, I am happy! Of course, there was the fast Amazon shipping.

"REVIEW SUMMARY - CityKitty cost me over $2,000 and A LOT of pain for my poor cat. For the details, read on....Original review:I sincerely have a hard time believing that it will work for just about any cat. It will likely result in a disgusting mess and an unfortunate cat who is forced to hold it in and/or have an accident. My cat went for the first week, consistently meowing in an unhappy manor, and used the Citi Kitty in conjunction with the floor and/or scraping whatever was in the Citi Kitty onto the floor.I feel that even had it been ""successful,"" there is still almost a guarantee that cats will not always be 100% accurate with it and you'll still wind up cleaning the bathroom a fair amount. I care too much about my cat to torture him any further, so I'm tossing this product out, and wanted to warn others about this terrible product!UPDATE - the unhappy meows from my cat were VERY SERIOUS, and he had a kidney stone from holding it in all the time! I followed their directions to a T and it was nothing but torture and accidents. He would pee anywhere but the CityKitty, so I had to resort back to the traditional litter box. Did that fix the problem? Not really. He was in such pain, he developed kidney stones from holding it in so much. I researched, and due to this, the cats associate going to the litter box with pain, so even with the litter box back in place, he still would pee outside of the litter box, and he started peeing blood since he had stones in him ripping away at his insides. At the vet, after a day and roughly $700 in tests and x-rays, we determined that he had kidney stones, and they were most likely the kind that will NOT dissolve with medicine / special diets. So we had two options - put him on a special diet and keep giving him narcotics and pain killers, hoping it will dissolve in the next month or two, or remove them via surgery immediately. I opted for the latter to make sure we could take care of it as fast as possible. After the expense of the x-rays and tests, we did the surgery, which was about $1,200. For the next 10 days, I had to give him a narcotic twice a day to ease the pain as much as possible. Then after all of this, we went back to the vet to have the stitches removed. He's going to be on a special diet permanently to make sure this never happens to him again.Oh yeah, and we sent the stones to a lab for testing. They are the type that would never have dissolved.So, if you are willing to risk your cat going through complete agony, paying a huge medical bill, and basically putting your poor cat through hell; most likely the worst experience in its life, go for it! Even if it works, get ready to clean your bathroom again and again, and deal with the annoyances all along the way regardless.",cats,2

"Rescued a dog from the shelter and upon arrival at home had horrible diarrhea. Took him to vet next day and found out he had Giardia. Was sent home with Metrodanzole. After a few days into Metrodanzole stools were a slight improvement, as soon as antibiotic finished, diarrhea looked worse than ever. (With the Metrodanzole he also got probiotics to balance his GI system). I was very discouraged with the worsening diarrhea, and vet did not want him rechecked for 30 days from his last dose of antibiotic. Well since i have two other dogs and Giardia was highly contagious i had to keep him seperated in my shed. Well 30 days is way too long to sit and do nothing. It's summer here in Texas, and i needed some other options quick and get this dog well and back in the house. So checked some blogs and read how Panacur has shown better results in clearing a Giardia infection. Well it was Sunday (vet was closed), when i read this and i had to be at work during the week and could not take off, on a whim i decided to check and see if it could be purchased on amazon. To my relief and amazement, you could! i ordered it and rec'd it in a matter of two days. . i started his treatment immediately, i bought two packs and treated him for 6 days. I read recommended dosage for giardia was 5-7 days and the pack only came in 3 day supply. I think the 3 day supply is successful for worms. Only a few days into Panacur and to my amazement his stools started improving. They are now completely normal, and his energy levels have spiked! Nearly two weeks later had him rechecked, and what do you know, no giardia! Thank you Panacur! And thank you Amazon for selling it on here!!",dogs,3

"I have used World's Greatest Litter for a couple years, and saw this on the shelves. So I decided to try it. Here was the result:1. Swheat Scoop is cheaper than World's Greatest2. Swheat Scoop is more fun to say.3. Swheat Scoop is less dusty than World's GreatestNow for the bad part:1. I am very allergic to the dust Swheat Scoop causes2. The clumping sticks like glue to the bottom of the box, no matter how deep I filled it.3. The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.4. The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.5. The litter is harder, so when you step on a tiny clump with bare feet, it hurts more. Only thing more painful is Litter Pearls.So overall, I am not impressed. Your mileage may vary.",cats,2

I've also noticed that the shedding is getter quite a bit better, which is wonderful! When you own two cats, the cat hair problem can get a little bad.It did take them a few days to get used to the food. This is probably because just like my kids they prefer junk food!But if you take it slow and mix the old food with the new for a while, they will adjust without having an upset stomach and getting to upset about the dietary change. And even though it's a little more expensive than the Purina that I was previously feeding them all of the benefits in my opinion outweigh the cost.",cats,2

This is my second orb The first lasted 5 yrs. when it began to leak I did a lot of looking but nothing compared to the baby orb so I replaced it with the same product and I love the look.

"I ordered a small for my yorkie. He weighs about 8 pounds. Love the coat for him, but wish I would have bought the size extra small - look at the sizing chart that is under the ""Product Details,"" would have saved me buying a bit too big (I'm not docking the star rating, as I should have done more research on the sizing). The small is for dogs 10-12 inches from the back of the neck to their bum. So, the coat on his back is perfect for him, but the straps that go under his belly cover up parts that need to be exposed :-). But I just stitched the straps a little, so they sit closer to his front legs, and it is going to work for my dog. Great product, the best little coat (that will keep him the warmest) for a dog I have ever seen.",dogs,3

"My little girl loves to shake the rattles and chew (lightly) on the ring. She's not a chewer, so we probably won't have the stuffing coming out from rough play. I like it because when she's playing with Pet Stages rattles I know exactly where she is! It's in her crate so I know when she's awake to take her out, too! I am impressed with Pet Stages toys - never heard of them until we got this puppy. Guess I was out of touch!",dogs,3
"My dachshund used to have trouble riding in the car. She would throw up within 1 hour of car ride. We had to carry her on our laps for the road trip. After I purchased the lookout car seat, she would sit in the seat by herself without any problem. To test the seat, we had a road trip from l.a. to vegas, she sat by herself and didn't throw up for the entire trip! This is the best purchase I ever made!",dogs,3
Love this product. It is great. We use it everyday. We have a German Shedder. She sheds constantly. We even ordered the shed ender and that product works but takes longer. It is small and takes forever. Plus the angle is funny on the shed ender. The FURminator has a larger head and combing takes about five minutes. The handle feels comfortable and natural when using it. This product is great. This product is sure to last a long time. Well worth the money.,cats,2

"Both my dogs use the Gulpy easily. It is a good size for shorter hikes and fits in my fanny pack. The only weakness is the belt clip, which is pretty wimpy if you really needed to use it. No leaking issues. It is way easier and faster to use than carrying a water bottle and separate soft water dish. On longer outings I carry extra water to just refill the Gulpy. Worth the Money!!",cats,2

I have tried crystals, Feline Pine, and SwheatScoop. At first SS worked great - great odor control AT FIRST, little dust AT FIRST, but now after 3-4 months of regular scooping I am noticing stronger odor than clay and MUCH more tracking than clay - and some dust!

The leash is durable and strong. Excellent quality.

"Our two bengal cats love this toy. They can play with it for hours (until we get tired of casting). They will sit next to it and stare at it. Sometimes the fishing wire will get tangled up but we just unscrew the base from the lid and fix it. Simple as that. If you are really in a bind with fixing the wire all the time, simply cut the string to its bare minimum shortest w/out compromising the cast of the line (i.e. don't cut too much off but leave just enough to cast a few yards) and re-attach your cat fisher toy. That should take care of the problem as well.",dogs,3
"I am pretty sure people purchase these syringes for other purposes, but it sure functions well as a glue dispenser for OCD Architecture students that like to build clean models.

"My wife and I had tried many different types of litter boxes including ones with doors and stairways. Nothing keeps the little pebbles of litter from getting on the surrounding floor like this box! Now I won't say NO traces of litter will make their way onto the surrounding floor, but it's much less than with other boxes. And the cats don't mind the top entry at all! We have two boxes and they work like a charm. SOme might use the liners but we just use the clumping litter so I can't comment on the liners.",cats,2
"I bought this bed for two dogs that love to chew on soft (blanket, couch) and hard (table leg, leather shoe) things. After two nights, they seem to love sleeping in it and haven't made any attempt to chew on it so far. They used to follow me around but with the new bed sometimes they are content just to lie in it. My dogs are 36lb and 40lb (slim dogs) and they fit well in the medium sized one. The 40lbs hangs out a bit depending on how she sits but I think she actually liked hanging her head out. The side walls get squished enough so that the dogs can rest their head, but their bodies do not touch the wall. I haven't washed it yet so I am keeping my rating to a 4 until I have. Looks promising though -- material looks like strong canvas. Strongly recommend.Updating to five stars. After a month, the beds are fully in tact. No holes -- amazing considering my dogs are chewers (sofa, shoes, door -- lots of headaches!). I haven't had to wash them yet either -- just vaccum and leaving them out in the sun freshens it up.",dogs,3

"I have a very fuzzy Australian Shepherd mix dog, and I live in an area of PA that has a major flea and tick problem. I have used Frontline Plus since I got my dog (about a year ago) and she has never had a flea OR tick problem.

I am VERY happy to have received this product for such a low price! Just be careful of the fakes and check the seller info. Also, for those who have had problems with this product being ineffective, make sure you are applying it to your dog's SKIN not fur :)",dogs,3

"We got the Tug-a-Jug this morning and have used it twice to dispense my dog's breakfast and dinner. She never quite figured out the ""tug"" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the ""tug"" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think.",dogs,3
"My little dog just opened his gift this Christmas morning. He went nuts over this barking little dog toy, carried it around and chewed on its nose. It's like his little baby now.

I started her on uti free and within 1 week she stopped peeing all over the house, no more blood in her urine, and she voided a bladder stone. Clea is back to her old self! I still give her 1 dose a day, just for maintence, this was a god send! I would recomend this product to anyone who has a pet suffering from any urinary disorder.",cats,2
"I have had this crate for almost a year and still love it! You CANNOT beat the price anywhere. The crate comes with the tray and with a partition if you needed it. The absolute best thing about this crate is that it is collapsible! When we have gone out of town, it so easily collapses to fit perfectly and save space in the car. Also, having the option of two different doors, one on the front and one on the side is really good for out of town trips or if you ever have to move it.I have never seen this size crate at such a good price!",dogs,3

I was absolutely shocked with the high quality and workmanship of this crate; am using them for 2 boxers; one 60 lbs the other 55 pounds....there is plenty of room and as soon as I set them up my boxers went into them immediately. Now they standon guard so no one else can get near them (I have 4 dogs - 2 are rescue dogs.....they need to stop putting those ads on television of the many dogs that need to be rescued...Ha !) Am using these for my two rescue dogs who I believe need a safe and comfortable place to go to until they are comfortable with their new home and the other dogs. I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED.The opening roof plus the side and front doors are wonderful; the ventilation on all sides is amazing and also allows the dog plenty of areas to look out and not feel so closed in....the crates are so easy to set up and take down; so light weight and sturdy. I would recommend this crate to any dog owner who is looking for the best crate on the market.I purchased these two crates from Amazon and received them the very next day.,dogs,3
"I bought this to go in a crate for a small dog who had to go through back surgery. He loves it so much, that he goes in the crate just to lie on it and he would never go near a crate before (I leave the door open). It's easy to wash and I think it's a great product.",dogs,3

It was so tempting to see, hear and smell the treats. Well, within 20 minutes the toy was in the garbage. He chewed off the rubber toy that blocks the treats from coming out. He then started to chew where the smell of the treats is able to escape. The plastic fell apart so easily! He then started to break off little pieces.

Have been using this product for years but this vendor ???1) Box didn't seem to be sealed properly when it arrived but appeared to be OK.2) The ampules then seemed to be of a different type of plastic that had to be cut open rather than snap open as usual.

"I bought this bed because I have a rescue dog that has to stay outside. It's getting colder now and I wanted something that could help keep her warm and my space heater was doubling my electric bill. She has access to a sun porch so I put the bed out there and keep it plugged up all the time. She loves it. It works great and I feel better knowing she has a warm spot to sleep on if she wants. I expected my electric bill to go up a bit, but I've seen little difference. This bed was worth every penny and I'd recommend it to anybody who keeps their pets outside when it's cold.",dogs,3
"I dont know what the other two guys issue was with this item but I had no problem at all. I have a pug and the little guy sheds like there is no tomorrow. I bought this thing at my local mall for 9.99 and tried it out today. It was awsome, the amount of fur that came off of him was nuts, I had a pile of hair that was the size of my pug. He loved it and seemed to want more even after I stoped. I am going to assume that the other two bad reviews here are pure user error, it has to be. This item works great and I would recomend it to anyone that has a pet with a sheding problem.",dogs,3

"I have two kittens that have grown quite a bit. They love to scatter the litter everywhere upon using the litter box. Without the domed litter box, the litter would get all over the floor and would require sweeping almost everyday. Since getting this new litter box, we only have to vacuum once or twice a month because of residual cat litter left on there paws over time. It controls the odor some, but like anything, you still need to keep the litter fresh and clean. I would highly recommend this cat litter to anyone having similar issues to mine. The best part is, the dome pops on and off with ease without the use of latches, hooks, etc. Great price for a useful box.",cats,2

"For controlling a single dog, this trainer is amazing. Like most everyone else commenting here, my dog had no interest in listening if there was another dog to play with or wild animals to chase. This trainer totally changed that. Now, he usually obeys voice commands without use of the trainer, and almost always obeys after I get his attention with the warning beep. The only time I still have to resort to the shock is when he is actively chasing some animal through the woods.That said, I just adopted a second dog, and discovered that the multiple-dog implementation (with ""add-a-dog"" collars) is pretty poor. The only multi-dog options are always beep or always shock. What about the beep-shock option that is available in single-dog mode? I don't want to have to use the shock immediately, without the option of issuing a warning beep to get the dog's attention, but the reality is that I still need to be able to shock if the beep is not obeyed.For a single dog, this is a 5-star product. For multiple dogs, it is more like 1.5 stars.If you plan on using multiple collars on multiple dogs, my advice is to skip the ""add-a-dog"" collars and just buy several of this product. It is more expensive, and you will have to carry multiple transmitters, but at least it will work.",dogs,3

Ultimately you get what you pay for. In this case you get even less. The one I got made a lot of bubbles which my fish enjoyed swimming through. That's the only positive I have for it.It's made of cheap materials. It didn't hold together well. It was a pain to adjust. Not that adjusting it made a difference. The assembly instructions were horrendous.In short,fish aquatic pets,4

"This is a well made and sturdy leash that I find a bit reassuring when walking my dogs on the side of the road before dawn. Although the reflective strip is only on one side of the leash, it is still easily visible to an approaching car. The strip is sewn and glued, so it does reduces the flexibility of the leash in that particular area. Lastly, I would add that this is a fairly heavy leash which I would probably not recommend for walking a dog that weighs less than 10 lbs.",dogs,3

"Don't waste time with the cheap dog-bone clickers. This is reliable and you never find you're mashing the ""wrong end"" and failing to make the noise precisely when you need to. This was just the right clicker for me and my GSMD puppy when we were both learning marker/clicker training technique. That said, I finally switched to using my voice (I follow Ed Frawley's training advice and now YES! takes the place of click). Why? because with a leash, treats, and other gear there's one less thing to manage by hand, I never misplace my voice, and am always prepared to emit the behavior marker at the correct time! The switch from clicker to voice was no problem for either me or my dog, and there are still uses for these excellent clickers in training.",dogs,3

"I've had this Petmate Fountain for probably three years, and really, the negatives far outweigh any positives. I find myself more and more fed up with how hard the unit is to clean. There are so many nooks and crannies that I simply can't reach with anything I have at home. I've also had more and more pump problems to the point that I think it might be dead now. Perhaps three years is good to get out of a pump, I'm not sure. At this point the pump seems completely seized up. Every trick that has worked before to get it working no longer does. With how hard the whole unit is to clean, I'm not sure I want to replace the pump and am looking to buy a hopefully easier to clean design.",cats,2
"I ordered the small sized (six inch)collar for my nine pound Maltese and he was overwhelmed by it. Probably the smaller cat-sized collar would have worked, but the floppiness, lack of stabilizer around the neck (just string) and the fact that he couldn't see around it made me go back to my clear plastic collar. Nice idea, just didn't work for me.",dogs,3

"I have owned several brands of canister filters ranging from Rena XPs, Fluval 5 series and then Eheim. My first canister filter is from Fluval and I kinda like it but the fact that I can't see inside the canister, really bothers me. The overall quality of Fluval is also mediocre. Most of the parts are made from plastic. Not any plastic but cheap felt like plastic. Next, I purchase a Rena XP3 filter that has see through canister. It was a lot easier to set up compare to Fluval and I love Rena's siphon/vacuum method but the humming noise is killing me even it is in the cabinet.As we all know Eheim is well known among fish hobbyist so I decided to try one. Since all filters designed differently, I went ahead and took out the how to guides or I assume that what it was. The directions was so poorly, I have hard time understanding it. I went to youtube and found somebody had similar experience and he decided to create a how to set up Eheim filter. You should be able to find out using common sense though but it was 12 o'clock at night and I decided to give my brain a rest so I googled and youtubed.After hooking everything up, all I can say is WOW. Yes, the directions is poorly made but the design and quality is far more superior comapared to my Fluval and Rena. It is sitting 3 feet from me and all I can hear is the output water noise. It also have dual valves which should make changing water a lot easier.",fish aquatic pets,4
I have a shar pei lab mix and a german short haired pointer mix and both of them adore these treats. The fact that there's so many in this package is a bonus and even though these treats aren't the cheapest - they're worth it for my dogs.I haven't noticed any improvement in my short haired pointer's breath - but he seems to have chronic bad breath and I'm sure these treats are at least cleaning his teeth like advertised.I will be buying these again!,dogs,3
"This is the first time I have been moved to review anything, but I am thrilled with this product. I wanted a ball that I could throw and bounce, as well as withstand being chewed on by my 110# lab, and I finally found it. Until now, balls that would bounce could be punctured and finally torn to pieces; balls that were indestructible were solid rubber and too heavy to throw and bounce. My dog has had two of these Orka balls for several months now, and they are both still in one piece and bounce like they did when they were new. The only problem I see is for the manufacturer - I don't have to buy new balls very often!",dogs,3
For the price you can't go wrong with this product. It is a nice pet enclosure. I would buy again.,dogs,3
"I purchased this brand of retractable leash thinking that it was a quality product, especially after seeing the very poor reviews that other retractable leash brands received.

"I'd heard great things about the Furminator, but just couldn't see spending sixty dollars on a brush. When I saw the brush offered on Amazon for half that price, I bought 2.Now I don't know how I lived without it so long! We have 5 dogs (a couple with thick coats, one with a long coat, and a couple with short coats), and we spent about an hour the first day brushing all of them. It was incredible how much fur came off each of the dogs. We brushed them again the next day and still got tons of fur off. The great thing was that for the next week, they hardly shed in the house at all. I was used to getting a hand full of fur each time I pet any of them, but I didn't get a single hair that entire week. We make a point to brush all of them each week now, but we really focus on the 2 with thick undercoats.The dogs really enjoy being brushed, so that was a bonus.I don't know how the brush works...but I can tell you that it definitely works!",cats,2
"Although I don't doubt that the product works to quiet dogs, the design is extremely feeble and it is difficult to use. I agree with other users on the fact that an ON/OFF switch added to the timer would be a much smarter approach to using the product. Although it is possible to find tricks to turn on the product (for example, setting the timer ON a couple of minutes after the current real time) it would be much easier to simply have a switch. As far as the barking goes, the dogs next door are indeed quieter since I started using the product. However, they still bark a little bit. I think a newer generation of this device, with a better, stronger design; an ON/OFF switch; a real weather-proof digital display (I have used the product for less than three weeks and the display is already a bit fuzzy!); as well as better ultrasonic speakers (to really quiet dogs down!) would greatly improve what today I see as a SOMEWHAT MEDIOCRE PRODUCT.",dogs,3
"I purchased this gate with the sole intention of using as a pet gate. This is not sturdy enough to be used as a child gate. However as a pet gate I give this two thumbs up.

"With the arrival of a new Catahoula Leopard dog puppy last December, I knew my carpeting was in trouble. Being a dog lover/rescuer, I had about 15 other pet stain removal products in my arsenal of dog supplies. Since none of them got all of the stain out, I figured what the heck - lets try one more. Boy am I glad I did! This one actually works!!!. Just spray a little on the spot, scrub it in (I use a battery operated scrubber), and dab it up with paper towels. It has gotten up the entire stain, 95% of the time on the first try and does not discolor the carpeting. It even cleaned up stains left-over from other products. And it does equally as well on vomit, pee, and poop. Highly recommend this product. (And, in an emergency, Get Serious is also available at PetSmart.)",dogs,3

"The food in my previous fish feeder always got a little wet and would clump together. I chose this feeder when I bought a new one, because it specifically said it was designed to avoid this problem. That hasn't been my experience. As time goes on, it seems to get worse. I don't know if this is because the door you open to insert the food gets looser over time and lets moisture in there, or what. The food won't stay dry for more than a day anymore, and I've only had it for 6 months, or less. Disappointed.",fish aquatic pets,4

Helpful book on aquarium fish. My grandson checked this one out of the library after winning 5 goldfish at a carnival and needed information how to take care of them and make a tank that would be healthy.

"My African brown-headed parrot absolutely loves this. He will even start tearing it apart while I'm in the process of hanging it in his cage. My only gripe, while not a fault of this toy, is the fact that my parrot can completely destroy this toy within a few hours, which gives me the impression that this is meant for smaller birds (cockatiels, etc.), but my bird enjoys this toy so much I order several and hang one for him every week or so, somewhat of a treat. If you have a small parrot, or another smaller bird, I am sure they will much enjoy this toy.",birds,0

"I ordered two of these doors (for walls) based on its good reviews and because it had an aluminum frame.Unfortunately, this product is about 95% plastic and rather flimsy. If you have one dog who might only use this occasionally and isn't very robust or athletic, this dog door might work for you. But if you have active, energetic dogs, Labradors, for example--I'd suggest a sturdier model. The only part on this dog door that is aluminum is the actual frame that holds the flap.It's very inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. The install seems easy enough, but this door would only last a month with my dogs.",dogs,3
"This filter works great and keeps my aquarium very clean. It's super compact which is a major plus for small aquariums! It measures approximately 3.25"" x 1.50"" x 7.25"" and can be placed horizontally or vertically in an aquarium. It also has an adjustable water flow rate, which can be adjusted to flow between 27-92 gallons per hour. The filter cartridges and media are very easy to replace and refill. Overall, this is an excellent filter with great features, and it would be a good choice for any aquarium 20 gallons or less.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I don't normally bother to write reviews, but I had to put in a plug for these. We adopted a mother cat and two 5 week old kittens a few weeks ago. The mom had been a stray and is really skinny, so we wanted to get her to eat something extra. We went to a cat show and one of the participants was feeding these to her cat as a treat. She said all cats love them so I ordered a jar. The mom and the kittens all love them. The only problem is that we keep them in the refrigerator and every time we open the door the mom cat comes running hoping for one and the kittens soon follow if they are awake.",cats,2

"It keeps my cat from gorging herself. She knew how to use it immediately. Sometimes she loses it and I have to help her find it, which is a little annoying.

"I bought this door for my two Ragdoll cats (19 and 13 lbs.) when I found the standard doors were too small for them to fit through. We are about to welcome a 75 lb. German Shepherd into the family. I wanted to give the cats a place to retreat to if needed and to keep their food and litter separate from a roaming dog. This door was easy to put in. We put one in a hollow door and the other in a solid panel door. The solid panel door needed to have a modification (where the panel recessed, approximately 1"" by 1/2"" thick by the length of the top - a piece of wood was cut to take up the space of the recess from the thicker part of the door. Other than that, they were very easy to put in and work beautifully. It took my 8-year-old (19 lb.) cat about 10 minutes to figure it out and my 16-year-old (13 lb.) cat a few hours (he looked at me as if to say ""you really want me to stick my head through that thing?"") But when he was hungry, he made his way through and has been using it ever since. I have used two of the settings, the ""you can go in but you can't get out"" and the ""you can come and go as you please"" and both have worked well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, it is well made and works well.",cats,2
"My parents gave me their old training collar and we used it for a short time on our dogs (one between 2 dogs, both stopped when the sound button was pressed.Were going camping this weekend and the park has a strict pet policy and quiet hours, so we ordered another one and both dogs will be wearing their collars.Tried the shock on ourselves to know what we were putting the dogs through, 1-3 were like running your feet on the floor and touching someone (small static charge). 4-5 were impressive and you knew you were getting shocked. 6 was it for me and have never had to get to 6 with my papillons. 4 is the highest we have ever gone and don't see them ever needing higher.The best thing about this unit is that it allows you to have a huge range of options for the amount of ""correction"" needed. Only thing that is bad is that the collar unit is a little large for my 7 pound papillon but it works and does what it's supposed to do (he hasn't had over level 2, so be appropriate with the correction level for your dog please!)",dogs,3
"I saw the mixed reviews and had to give it a shot. Very disappointed!! I put the item it, it immediately sunk to the bottom and started to slightly dissolve or fizzle. That was it! After three days it still did not provide food. I had to keep feeding my beta during those days because it was quite obvious it was starving. After the third day i took it out and ran it under water and i never saw any fish particles of any kind. Have no idea what the fish was supposed to eat as there was nothing freeze dried inside of it. RIP OFF! I had the water ph and temperature perfect for this work. I would like to know from someone who used it with success what the process was like for them, as I still have the rest of them left.",fish aquatic pets,4
"My outside cat loves this mat! She is a wild cat who sleeps in our cold garage at night and I have had other warming mats which she liked, but this mat is warming for her and is also plush.

It was so inexpensive I am going to order more.",cats,2
"If you keep dogs, cats, or any animal that is outdoors, this item is a must have! Plug in the waterhose and never worry about filling the water bowl again! The only issue, is that I have bought this item every two to three years since where I keep it, it appears to get green algae in the gray areas of the bowl where sunlight hits. It does clean easily if you do it regularly (every month or so), but if you wait, you may need to scrape the surface with something to make cleaning the easiest. However, I don't see where the algae hurts anything. The seals have stayed good without leaking, the automatic action is adjustable to ensure it shuts off at the right level to spill over the side, and any issue I have had were easily fixable (the inside componenets are easily fixable and adjustable without any overly sophisticated design, just a floater inside that triggers a shut-off valve). No issue with leaks, only had to adjust the floater to shut off where I wanted the water line to be.",cats,2
"If you are going to use a UGF this is the plate you want. Cheaper ones break apart easily when vacuuming and do not have even flow.

Contrary to what people say, I never had to remove the plate and clean underneath. I have had these in the same tank for over a decade and the fish flourished.",fish aquatic pets,4
This shirt really works. My 7 year old Lab/Border Collie is deathly afraid of Thunderstorms and Fireworks. What this shirt does for him is he recovers much quicker after the event. He loves wearing this shirt and wears it even in nice weather because it makes him feel secure. I don't know how or why but I do know it helps him a lot. It took a few times wearing it but I have noticed a big difference when he wears it during a Thunderstorm.,dogs,3
"Being able to clean out all waste(solid AND liquid) on a day to day basis is the main reason I switched over to Swheat Scoop which I really like. It keeps the cat box truly clean and it's flushable.I was previously using Feline Pine(also reviewed) for a single adult cat but switched to Swheat scoop after having waste coverage issues with the pine pellets with my new kitten. Essentially, if your cat/kitten has runny turds, you need a finer litter size to effectively cover that waste so your cats don't step on them and track cat poo all over the house.Feline Pine is ""set it and forget it""(basically, it absorbs all liquids for two weeks and then you toss out the entire box of litter) but it's NOT flushable(the Swheat Scoop is), so you have to deal with wasting trashbags on a bag full of used litter. For me, that was fine every two weeks for one cat, but not every week with two cats.The Swheat Scoop works great in terms of clump-ability and odor control. You do have to ""pan for gold"" every day or so and having the right scoop is crucial(I recommend the Scoopwell Cat Litter Scoop) for that. Also, you absolutely need a tracking mat. My Omega Paw Paw-Cleaning Litter Mat which worked fine for the larger Feline Pine pellets, simply did not cut it here. I found a product called StopTrax that is essentially a grid on top of a catch basin. It does a great job of catching the smaller grain of the SwheatScoop.I have had no issues that others mention. Yes, you do have to scrape the bottom of the box from time to time, but it's a fairly simple matter if you clean it every couple of days. Odor control is great and the litter has a faint sweet wheat smell. It doesn't cover the odor up, it just ""takes care of it"". I even removed the cover of my Booda Box to allow my cats more space to ""work"" in and I have not smelled any odor.Other than the tracking issues(and it is an issue, you WILL need a good tracking mat/rug), this stuff is near perfect and it's much cheaper than World's Best.",cats,2
Perfect size for training. Easy to break in half (or smaller) for smaller dogs and toy breeds. Haven't found any dogs yet who have turned them down. I appreciate the quality of the ingredients. It's not easy to find good treats which don't require refrigeration. These are small and soft and perfect for class. They have enough smell/taste appeal to compete with other normal training class environment. I've purchased these in a number of flavors for use in classes and with my own dogs. I recommend them to my students because of the quality and convenience.,dogs,3

"I'm very pleased with my purchase of DAP. It was shipped very quickly. Like everything else, it works for some dogs and not for others. I got it to see if it would make grooming more excitable, anxious dogs easier. It did for the most part. I sprayed it on my smock and refreshed it every 3 hours. All of the dogs were very interested in sniffing where I sprayed the DAP. Most of them calmed down right away, with one nearly falling asleep. One or two remained anxious. All in all I rate this product highly but do caution that it just won't make a difference with some dogs.",dogs,3
"Due to allergies on the part of one dog, and pickiness on the part of the other, I've switched to natural dog food over the past year. Of them all, my dogs love this stuff the best.

Relatives who hadn't seen the dogs for a few months immediately commented on the healthier appearance and renewed vigor of the dogs.",dogs,3

So I went ahead and bought the jumbo version for my two cats. We've had it for about 4 weeks now, and it's been great! I don't find it hard to clean, or to refill. My one cat loved it immediately, but it took the other a few days to get used to the running water and the noise. It's not noisy by any means, but it sounds like exactly what it is...a fountain! My husband and I travel a lot on the weekends, so it's great to not have to worry about them running out of water, or it getting stale. I am happy that I went with the Jumbo size b/c I think I would have been refilling it much too often if I had gotten something smaller...so if you have two adult cats, I definitely recommend the Jumbo.",cats,2

"I bought the 1.77 gallon, purple one today at a petstore for $19.99 and thought that my white & purple betta would look great in it. However, after I set it up and put Indie in it, I could hardly see him - the lid makes the tank too dark to see the natural colors of any fish that is in there. He looked all black or dark purple. I even put my desk lamp to shine over the top, but it was still too dark with the lid on; what more without any lighting at all? He looks much prettier when I lifted the cover for the light to shine in, but the lid seems to pop off from the hinges too easily, and I feel as if one day it will just slide off when I lift it for feedings and crack when it hits the floor. The gravel is a bright blue with the light on, and detracts from the beauty of the fish itself. The filter is quiet; you can hardly hear the hum. However, on the lowest setting, it is still a little too strong for a betta. I put it on the right rear corner of the tank, and placed the 'included' plant in front of it to slow down the current, but Indie seems to only swim around the left half of the tank. Overall, even though it's a reasonable price for a tank that comes with gravel, filter and a fake plant, I think it looks cheap. It looks nice on the box and there were good reviews on the store's website - that's why I bought it. If I had wanted one of those cheap plastic starter tanks, I could have gotten one for $8 or less. I will probably return it to the store and get something else.",fish aquatic pets,4

"First off, ScatMats do work as advertised. I used to roll 3 of them, $180.00 worth, out on the kitchen counters every night and roll them up again in the morning.Cats are smart critters and learn quickly. Instead of jumping up on the counters at night, they'd just loiter around on the kitchen floor playing tag and daring each other to see who might be dumb enough to take a leap.What I really wanted was for them to stay out of the kitchen altogether. I tried placing the ScatMats on the floor but they'd jump over them.I read countless reviews on electric-eye devices that spray. None were without problems and the refills are expensive.Great news. If you wish to keep your cats out of an entire room, here's what worked for me..and it's CHEAP.Driveway Patrol Sensor and Receiver Kit available from Amazon.Com. Currently $17.59 PRIME.Mount the alarm facing into the room about light switch high at the room entrance so you can easily turn the switch off before entering the room. Set the electric eye sensor on the floor next to a wall a few feet inside the room.At first, the cats will casually enter the room and walk past the alarm and curiously inspect the weird new thing on the floor. That's when the training session begins. Unless there's another entrance, they have to run toward the screaming monster to escape. The alarm only lasts 3 seconds. That's ample time for them to be all the way in the back of the house with enough momentum to go into orbit.We haven't had a cat in the kitchen at night in over 3 weeks. They all mull around at the entrance every morning waiting for me to enter before they'll go near the kitchen.I store the sensor in a dark cabinet during the day to save the battery power.The ScatMats are in storage until the next overnight company arrives.",dogs,3

Always works, no problems with it, no problems reprogramming it or anything of that sort.Cats try to paw up there but never get anything out and gave up trying after the first few failed attempts.I give it 4 stars b/c you can not really take it apart and clean it.

The entertainment derived from this toy is rivaled only by the laser light toy.I like the feather lure since it spins as the lure is pulled through the air. The feather is difficult for the cats to grab, so they have to work very hard to grab and hold it; making play last longer. Both of my cats get very worked up playing, and the resulting acrobatics are delightful! The toy has held up through some very rough play, including with my large dogs.",cats,2
"This cage is sold as both a chicken coop and a rabbit hutch. (for the coop, Ware adds a perch While I've never been a fan of keeping a bunny in a small hutch, If it has a run to play in, this does add good security during the sleeping hours. However, I personally utilized it as a an add-on piece to an existing coop to give the rescue birds a bit of a mini mansion. This large hutch, I should note, is bigger than I expected.I attached it to the back of an existing coop, made the attachment predator proof, and utilized it for more nesting boxes.So, let's touch on what makes this good for either rabbits or chickens because the positives and negatives relate to either creature.Assembly:Super simple. Couldn't be easier.Stability:Impressive. Many hutches have thin wires that raccoons and other predators can actually bite through. Using my long handled wire clippers, even I could not cut through these without EXTREME force. No way could any animal bite through this except perhaps a shark and if those are in your backyard than wiring is the least of your concerns, after all. I had to clip some of the wires to create the attachment of my two coops. Also, you can't see it from the picture, but just above that metal tray that slides out for cleaning at the bottom is a heavy wired bottom above it for double protection on the bottom. However, don't leave a chicken or a bunny on wire, of course, put down bedding. not cedar bedding incidentally, many don't realize those fumes actually can cause long term liver and kidney effects on your pets. Use pine or straw)Access:The top is not only hinged, but of course you can reach through the front door as well. It's easy to reach in through the top the way it opens.Off the ground:Prevents mice from smelling the food and water and gaining access.Negatives:Those are the things I love about it but there are things I changed. For example, your pet is TOTALLY a victim of all elements. Heavy rains can come in sideways and there is no way to get away from it. I am in Texas and I put this outside and noticed there wasn't one bit of shade in it in spite of it's size...the sun came in through 3 sides, filling the entire hutch with brutal heat. Why brutal? The top is also dark and absorbs heat. But all this can be fixed.I added Siding part way up (only part way so there is good air circulation and venting from the ammonia in any wastes) on 2 sides and I added nesting boxes. Now rain cannot flow in and there is ample shade.You can get sheets of tin cut with tin snips and screw them on or you can just use square pieces of wood.Ideally if this wasn't under shade I would also put a tin roof on it to reflect the sun rather than absorb it with a sheet of styrofoam under the tin to insulate it. However, my chickens have access to a coop built this way so I don't need to do it for this piece as well as it's only used for laying eggs. You can just cut the tin sheets you get cheap at a hardware store with tin snips, put the styrofoam sheet under it, and screw on.This is not raccoon proof by any means but you can make it so. Raccoons love chicken and rabbit so most hutches are built to keep them out. A raccoon can get in a trash can with a bungee cord tied around it, a latch on it, and a heavy rock on top of it (trust me, I know from experience) so this is almost a raccoon invite. You need to add a latch at the top that can't simply be turned to open it. We added a latch with a key lock and just leave the key in during the day, and leave it hanging on a string attached to the lock at night with with latch locked. If a raccoon knows how to use the key dangling in the lock, then that is one genius coon and I give it props for outsmarting me but I dont expect that to happen.Also, you would want to add a spring lock at the door access. Again, simple latches are opened quickly by raccoons. They can't access the spring locks.This only takes a few bucks and a few hours and ensures no one's heart will be broken to find a defenseless pet maimed in the morning from one of it's most common predators.I have another wire coop by ware and the wiring holes are smaller which I prefer. No raccoon paws and no snakes could fit inside them. Snakes could get in here, the paws might be doubtful but I still wonder. but my provisions of adding sides and hideaways inside prevent any tragedies.Incidentally, I got mine 1/3 of the normal price because a site called Critter Cages got some in that had a tiny bit of breakage on one of the sides, easily fixed. So I scored big. But even at the normal price, I think the hutches are made very well as long as whatever is inside gets mostly outdoor run or free range time. Nothing should be in a hutch most of it's time; it stresses the pet out and results in fights between 2 or more pets inside them.Conclusion",bunny rabbit central,1

It has the pleasant and sweet aroma of a new harvest.This is the highest quality bird food you can buy. Your birds will love you for feeding them Hagen.

This collar was great a first! It worked for about 6months then we had to buy a new one cause it stopped working. The 2nd one worked for a bit but our dog started to figure out that if she barked 10 or more times the collar would run and then she was a free women to bark all she wants. So we had to keep refilling it. I bought numerous refills and replacement batteries for the collar. It finally got to the point where the collar was just blowing air not even the spray was working. So we finally bit the bullet and went with the shock collar.,dogs,3

He doesn't complain about anything and actually is always happy to see me after the weekend.

"Just set up Innovative Marine Nano 8 tank, my first aquarium. Great tank, but it only has a passive filter, so I added the Penguin 20 as an 'extra' active filter, I have it hung on back of tank filtering/recycling water TO and FROM the ""pump"" column in the tank, thereby providing water with an extra filtration pass over and above what the water gets from the Nano 8 passive filter.Anyway, SUPER easy set up. When starting it, it takes a good 60-120 seconds to start actually flowing water through the bio wheel. Plug it in (after filling it) and let it run a min or 2 it will kick in. You may need to keep adding a bit more water to the back of the unit til it kicks in. Also make sure the little bio wheel prongs are in their slots so it spins properly.Was realy buzzy/vibraty/noisy first few days (annoying!!) as I live in studio apt. But after 3-4 days of use, it is now much quieter. Seems to filter real well, media insert super easy to replace. I am happy customer so far. Oh there is room to add little filter media bags of additional media (I added a little bag of carbon and a little bag of ammo chips).The only minus-1 star is because, as noted, I have 8 gallon tank. The pump seems to add a few (5?) degrees to the water temp. With NO tank heater turned on, my apt. at 67-70 degrees ambient, my tank went from 74/75 or so (probably due to tank light and tank pump) to 80/81, the only change being addition on the Penguin 20. Probably will have negligible effect on 15+ gallon tank.Anyway, I hope this review was helpful, keeping in mind I am a complete aquarium newb. I am also glad the Penguin 20 seems to have gotten quieter.If anyone else sets up a Nano 8 and wants this filter too, feel free to msg me as to how I made it fit just right. I will try to add some photos as well.PS. I *love* the Innovative Marine Nano 8 tank! Highly recommended.PPS. photos are taken with cell phone so, sorry for the mediocre quality.",fish aquatic pets,4

"This is the first product I've labelled ""perfect"" ... I'm pretty picky.I put this product on the edge of a round glass table and it works perfectly.I keep in in BEEP ONLY mode while I'm awake in order to make the can last longer.In BEEP MODE, it does not use the pressurized can, only the battery powered beep.When a cat gets on the table, it beeps ... which is SO COOL!Cats are very intelligent and know how to do naughty things without being caught--until now!When I hear the beep I come and spray the cat (who is still standing on the table wondering how I knew) with water.If someone walks right by the table, it will also beep.The beep is not obnoxious and will not scare the cat--in my opinion the beep is to alert humans.It DOES NOT false alarm by movement across the other side of the room.At night I switch to SPRAY MODE ... which is SO COOL!I put an index card sign up saying STOP to remind humans to not get within range.Cats really react to the sound of spraying, since that's what they do when they fight.This morning I woke up and checked the area and sure enough the place mat and sign were on the floor ... meaning a cat had been scared off the table by the device. The cats DO NOT knock anything off unless something scares them off the table.I LOVE THIS GADGET! It actually does what it says it will do!By the way ... initial assembly requires significant hand and arm strength.",cats,2
"We recently took in a kitten from a friend. The day we brought him home, I noticed fleas on him, so we immediately gave him a flea bath (we used Hartz flea shampoo.) He appeared to be flea-free following the flea bath. It should be noted that this cat is an indoor cat and never leaves the home nor do we have anyone else's pet come into our home.A few weeks passed without much thought about the fleas. I was holding him one day and noticed a flea crawling on his face. I immediately gave him another flea bath and thought the problem was gone. It wasn't.Flea bites began appearing on my feet and ankles. I decided to purchase Frontline Plus after reading the positive reviews here on Amazon.com. I expedited the order and the moment it arrived at my home, I applied Frontline to him. I also flea bombed my home.Over the next few days, I continued to check the kitten. He still had just as many fleas (maybe even more) as he'd started with prior to the Frontline application. We tried waiting it out, hoping that the Frontline just needed time to work. Big mistake. The flea infestation within my home skyrocketed. It was at the point that flea bites started appearing over my body, head to toe, and I could see the fleas visibly jumping on the ground and onto my body.I contacted several vets and many message boards and I've gotten the same response from everyone - that Frontline Plus is virtually useless in the south, especially Florida (where we reside.)I cannot express to you how maddening this whole situation has been. Not just because my cat is suffering but I am, too. The flea bites not only itch intensely but they burn and are unsightly. I cannot even relax in my own home without having a flea jump on me.Please, please, please DO NOT waste your time or money on this product (especially if you live in the South.) It does NOT work!!!! I wish I would've known this prior to purchasing Frontline. I have spent so much time and money at this point on combating the fleas PLUS the anti-itch creams, healing creams, shampooing the carpets, re-washing laundry, etc etc. It's been a nightmare!After thorough research, we are now flea bombing the house, applying Advantage and also applying Fleabusters carpet powder to our carpeting. We also used a Capstar tablet which the vet was nice enough to give us for free. My fingers are crossed that this works.",cats,2

"This is a great box and I second all praise in the other reviews. The bullets points of my personal experience are:* Our 14 pound, taller than average, cat fits fine.* However, the lid doesn't lock well and our cat used to knock the lid off.* I now slip a 2.5 pound weight under the lid handle and it stays on fine.* My cat can fling litter around like crazy without making a big mess.* However, he still manages to track some of his Feline Pine out of the box. Booda's fancy stairs catch some but not all.* The box keeps the stink in pretty well, which is good and bad. We have to remind ourselves to change the box. It won't stink on the outside but can be totally rank on the inside. If we forget to change it, our cat won't brave the stink inside and will use something else.* Most liners won't fit this box. We buy the Booda brand made for this box.* We only change the carbon filter around twice per year. The filter does do something, but not so much that it's worth changing all the time.Overall, I join in with those who've said I would definitely buy this box again.",cats,2

Dr Bronner's didn't help much with the smell. Cain $ Able shampoo worked better. Although it didn't make my dog smell like flowers as I expected, he does smell fresher and his coat has been much softer and shinier. Also he seems to have less flea problem. I haven't used any flee medicine for him for a few weeks. Just by showering him with this shampoo, he didn't seem to have fleas so far.",dogs,3

"This is a strong, well made product. There are three zippered flaps(one on the side, one on the front and one on the top), that makes it extremely easy to get your pet in and out of the carrier. It is large enough that I could easily put both my cats in together, if needed(they are both about nine pounds). I would NEVER go back to the plastic crates with the one small metal grate door on the front-I couldn't even get my cats out of ours at the vet without a huge struggle. The Firstrax Sof-krate pet carrier avoids that struggle and is soft and cozy. I did add a big soft towel on the bottom of the crate for my cats to lay on.I only have one con and that is the smell of the fabric that covers the steel frame. I let it set out in my laundry room for a few weeks before I took one of my cats to the vet in it. It is a sort of chemical/petroleum smell but is dissipating now. I am tempted to take the removable fabric covering off and throw it in the wash to see if that removes the left over smell.",dogs,3

"I must agree with previous reviewers; if you find this litter box ineffective or cumbersome, it's most likely that you are using it incorrectly, put it together incorrectly, or are using low-quality cat litter that does not clump well. I suspect that some of the negative reviewers were using non-scoopable litter, which definitely would defeat the purpose of this box. I was skeptical at first, but compared to other ""self-cleaning"" litter boxes this one is a steal so i decided to try it. The first time I used it I was blown away. It is extremely simple, the fresh litter flows into a small compartment that is grated off, and the clumps, unable to fit through the grate, tumble all the way over and right into the collection pan. The pan, which is quite large, slides right out, and then you slowly tip the box over the opposite way to redistribute the fresh litter. It literally takes less than 60 seconds. I have been faithfully hand scooping and changing cat litter for the 5 years I have had my cat, and I feel like a huge burden has been lifted, both from my body and mind, not having to seek-and-scoop and dump out heavy, used litter, and also not worrying about when I will find time to do it. I cannot recommend this thing enough, it is wonderful, my cat is happier with her perpetually-clean box, and I couldn't be happier with it. You owe it to yourself and your cat to get this thing. In my opinion, this is the evolution of litter boxes.",cats,2
I bought this filter for a 55 gal. tank. I much prefer this filter over other filters that you have to buy new filtering medium every time you change the filter. I put the sponge on the top instead of the bottom so it is easy to take out and wash. My tank is much clearer than with the AquaTech I had been using. It runs very quietly. My only COMPLAINT is that it said to wash the charcoal bag before putting it in the filter and the charcoal was so fine half of it washed out before the water ran clear. I'll definitely have to rig my own charcoal bag to replace it. The little doodad that is supposed to level the filter is iffy but it works. Make sure you put it on in the step listed on the paper or you'll have trouble getting it on. Especially if you don't have extra space between your wall and the filter. Even with these minor drawbacks I would not hesitate to buy another because it works very well and is so easy to wash the filter sponge.,fish aquatic pets,4

"I've tried a lot of different cat toys for Hugo. He's a playful kitty that hunts in the house. If he likes the toy, he'll carry it as he would a live mouse, growling all the way. He's picky. He likes this one because it's a good size (close to real mouse size, and fits in his mouth). It has a nice smell and a good chew texture. The plasticy fabric on the outside makes the toy last. Hugo takes the mouse to his bowl of food..chew on the toy, growl, chew on the food, chew on the toy, growl, and on and on. This is the only toy I've found that is resilient enough to handle this punishment. Also, I can rinse the food off, dry it in the sun, and it's good as new to re-use. Added extra is that it's filled with catnip, so if it does open up, Hugo is not eating plastic filler.",cats,2

"I have a house-rabbit who is litter box trained, but I also keep a small wonderbox in his cage, too. He likes to get in the box to snuggle and when he gets bored, he rips and chews at the box, little by little. I like that it is made from 100% recycled paper in case he decides to ingest some of it. It gives him something to do while we are away at work/school. We clean out the bits of paper every other day and by the end of a week, he has whittled the box down to just the bottom and maybe an inch on the side. He gets a brand new wonderbox every week. I'm satisfied with the cost, the quality and knowing that I'm giving him something to chew on, aside from the rest of his chew toys.",cats,2
This product works exactly as promised. Placed evenly on my couch my cat does not scratch it anymore but he also has been given a proper scratching post to direct his attention towards. Just buying these strips alone will not stop your cat from scratching - make sure you have another outlet for it!,cats,2

"This clipper starts out with a dull blade, and the replacement blade it comes with is also dull. Very hard to get the blade to slice through the nail, and when it finally gives way with a loud whack, it jaggedly cracks the poor dog's nail and leaves broken edges, torn bits of nail that remain and you have to cut off, and worst of all, it cracks and chips pieces of nail above the point you are cutting. This leads to pain for the dog! All other people's reviews on other sites of this product have stated the same things I have here. Even one groomer who rated this clipper and said she had been a professional groomer for 20 years said ""it's the suckiest clipper ever made."" No one believes this clipper is any count at all except Millers Forge themselves! I am so sorry I wasted my money on this. One use and in the garbage can it goes.",dogs,3
Only had to use it on my yellow lab twice in 3 weeks. It gets out the hair. The dog likes it. And no more hair on my clothes. It takes about 6-8 min. for my Lab. Buy used if you can. I saved about 30 bucks,cats,2

"Replaces a similar leash a dog chewed through. Not as good a fit on my hand as its predecessor, but it may fit someone else's hand better. I could do without the red logo, but this leash does the job. Also, I wish Flexi would go back to the cord style retractables for large dogs - I understand people hurt fingers on the cord leashes, but in twenty years of owning corded retractables, I somehow managed to not get fingers caught in a twisted cord. The cord retractables retract more quickly and reliably. But all in all this is a very good leash.",dogs,3
"I bought this pet bed for my Australian Terrier, and she loves it. She likes to do her little digging thing she does and curl up under the pillow. Took pillow out of old pet bed and put it underneath this for a little extra cushioning due to the fact it was not as thick as one I had before. All in all though, it is a great bed.",dogs,3

"Lixit is my favorite bottle, albeit a bit more expensive compared to the Living World or Super Pet bottles. It hangs better through cage bars.for those who say their bottles leak, etc. Here is a bit of advice...I use glass bottles on all my rodent cages, as with any water bottle, you must make sure the washer is properly seated to prevent leaking. Use a pointed object like knitting needle to press the washer down evenly if the bottle is leaking. The washers will come loose during refilling, so turn the bottle right-side up over a sink and watch to make sure that the drips slow and then stop. Test the ball-bearing by tapping the end to ensure that water does come out. Do this EVERY time, with EVERY water bottle no matter what brand.I have owned rodents for over 15 years, there is always a chance of getting a water bottle of any kind that will not work properly. Lixit has an excellent track record for me. I was a bit disappointed that the two bottles I ordered from Amazon were missing the floater (the green turtle) though. I plan on writing Lixit and asking for them because it makes it easier to judge water levels when the bottle has a bright float in it.",birds,0
"I have a Border Collie who loves to chase the ball. Not only does this allow me to continue throwing much longer than before, but so much farther that it wears her out. When we get home it's right to bed. Great for kids to play with too (to throw, not to fetch). The easy pick-up feature keeps that nasty ball out of your hands.",dogs,3
"I bought this product after seeing how well it worked on a friend's dog. I was hoping to minimize the barking of my 13 year old yorkie. Well, the product does not work on him at all. He gets himself so worked up, that the collar runs out of spray. I must also add that his hearing is very poor so I don't think he can hear the ssstttt sound the collar makes as it sprays. I also suspect that the spray is more directed at his whiskers and is not reaching his nose. That said, the collar does not work for him.However, when he is wearing it, and it goes off as he and my other two dogs are barking, it works wonders on them. They are not even wearing the collar yet stop barking immediately and move to the other room for fear of getting sprayed by his collar. I do feel the collar works depending on your dog's personality. If you have a little tyrant like I do that will not stop barking for anything, it is not going to work for you. However, if your dog is a little meeker and more submissive I think it will work great.",dogs,3
"I had purchased this product from a local store in the past for my fresh water tank and have never had any problems using it. I was surprised to read some had the opposite opinion.

"I have to confess I ordered this to fill up an order to get free shipping. This is the best cat toy I have ever bought and believe me, I have spent much on more expensive items. I have two cats, One a youngster of three and one a more mature cat of nine. The youngest cat has claws and destroys most of her toys soon after she gets them. Not this toy....very well made and has survived without losing a feather so far. The feathers are very heavy duty and I just can't believe it cost so little. Both cats love the toy. The youngest likes it when I make it""fly"". The construction is such that it wiggles and moves just like a real bird when you whip it through the air. She goes into hunting mode and when I finally let her catch it she flattens her ears back and takes it in her mouth and takes off with it with me running behind. Very funny site. The older cat likes it when I drag it on the ground and she chasses it so I alternate flying and dragging it all through the house and we all get our exercisae. You can't go wrong with this toy.",cats,2
"The first time I brought this bag out for a trip to the vet, my cats jumped in by themselves. Even now that they know where they'll end up, the top opening is big enough, and there is plenty of room, so it's no problem to drop them right in. It's sturdy enough to withstand scratching, and they're both comfortable in there together. It easy for me to carry as well, with the shoulder strap. It also closes up well enough that there's no way for them to squeeze out. Well worth it, I expect this to last for a long time.",cats,2
I bought oone of these for my crazy Dobie chewer. He destroys every toy we get him. So When I found this ball on Sale I figured Eh why not. I gave it to him and 10 mins later the raised parts of the world started falling off... No big deal. We peeled the rest of the raised world parts off so now it is just a ball. He and my other Shep/Wolf mix are in love! Yes the toy isnt indestrucable but even if your dog peels off the raised parts the toy isnt destroyed!!! It still can be used at a ball! Im hooked. Dogs are hooked. We are happy.,dogs,3
Super nice collar. Nicely trimmed with material to protect the dog's neck and edging to protect anyone else from getting scraped by contact with it.Problem is---I could not get the sticky icky giant label off the collar. Stupid to ruin a nice clear well made collar with this huge sticker that does not come off without a fight. I am trying soaking it now. Peeling it was a waste.....stuck on there good. And unfortunately blocks part of the dogs vision.,dogs,3

"This drink well is really great. My cats (2) really enjoy the fresh water. One thing to mention is ... it needs to be tended to consistantly. It will get dust and cat hair etc in the catch area and that needs to be pulled out. It also needs to be fully cleaned and washed out about 4+ times per year, you can do this with just a little plain dish soap and be sure to rinse it very well. However that is not a bad thing, it just keeps it fresh and last longer. NEVER let it run dry- the motor will burn out. Overall I DO recommend this product, it encourages the Cat to drink water often and if you feed them dry food at all they really NEED to drink alot of water.",cats,2

"My cats absolutely love this thing, and I have to keep it stored away when we're not playing so they don't tear it apart or hide it somewhere. However, I can't help but think that a little bit of ergonomic design could improve this toy dramatically. The ""handle"" is merely the same rolled up cardboard as the the ""play"" end, and when you're playing with the cats for even 10 minutes, I immediately get some kind of cramping of the fingers and hands. Now, I'm only 28, so I don't think I have arthritis, but the way you have to manipulate this thing to move about requires a lot of effort, and the thumb and index finger just wasn't designed for that amount of stress. Now, if this wire was attached to a larger wooden or plastic handle, I would give it 5 stars. As it is now, only 3.",cats,2

"I ordered the Merrick lamb lung treats on the advice of a dog agility friend who had great success with them. My dog has been blowing her contacts in agility trials, and my friend suggested using these special treats ONLY when training the dog walk, A-frame, table, and see-saw. After just two training sessions, my dog is once again racing to the contacts and sticking them. My fingers are crossed that this behavior will carry over to the trials, but with the help of a clicker and these apparently very appealing treats, I'm seeing renewed confidence and enthusiasm. They're expensive, but are a bargain compared to the wasted trial entry fees and travel costs. I'm also going to use them as I begin very basic obedience training with our new rescue dog.",cats,2

We try to use the shock as infrequently as possible, and have found that is really isn't necessary all that often. Every once in a while he will challenge the beep, and we are forced to shock, but really not that often. This item has not only allowed us to enjoy time with our pet outside, but has given him more freedom to roam the yard.I've read that the battery is an issue. We've used it for a few weeks, and no problems, but have always remembered to turn it off. I can see, though, how not remembering could be an issue.",dogs,3

"I bought this to replace a more table style raised dish holder that was getting damaged from water and was a pain to keep clean. I got the 3-quart size and the dishes seem *huge* to me. I'm going to keep it, but I would get the 2-quart if I had it to do over. The larger size is nice for water, but laughable for my 70-pound dog's usual food serving which barely covers the bottom of the dish. The wrought iron scrollwork is attractive, but I left off a star because one of the legs was a bit bent. I also think that this product should cost much less for what it is.",dogs,3

"Two years ago our seven year old yellow lab could hardly get up from her laying down position and was in a lot of pain. We spend over $700 in tests and x-rays just to be told they didn't know what her problem was. A neighbor down the street told us her dad had a yellow lab with the same symptoms and started his dog on this product plus the senior dog food with glucosamine and chondroitin in it. Six months later she is back to her puppy self, chasing the birds and neighborhood cat when she gets in our back yard. We walk 3 miles four days a week and never slows down. We put this product over her food which gives it more flavor and she gobbles it up. I am so grateful to have found this product.",dogs,3

I recommended this to a friend who was trying to integrate a feral cat into her household which included 2 other cats. She also felt that this diffuser was a miracle. I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to tackle difficult issues with an unhappy cat. Don't forget, if the ""spraying"" is a new behavior, get the cat checked by a vet to make sure there is not medical cause.",cats,2

I would say overall this is a great product for people that are going to be home at least once a day. I have two cats and they are both fine with the large omega paw box. So far I have not had a major issue the only thing I was worried about was my larger cat but he just has his head and upper body hanging out while he does his business. I can see it being an issue if you have a larger cat that likes having his space since about half the box is taken up by the trap and pull out container.The Pros as far as I can see is that you never really have to worry about having cat litter flying every where when you scoop. After the set up it is pretty simple just add the litter and roll it when your cats do their business. Sometimes when it is upside down you have to hit the bottom to make sure everything falls off. Then just take the scoop out and done.The negatives I mainly have run into is that you have to refill the litter more often and also the other big problem is if you let the cats go more than 2 days max you will have to perform the movement a few times or may have to give in and scoop the litter. Sometimes you can avoid the litter all collecting on one end by tilting the box forward after it is upright then hold in the catch bin and give the box a little shake. Still best way to avoid this mess is just doing the litter once or twice a day so you don't have to deal with the potential mess.All and all I would say a great product as long as you plan to use it as a daily litter box and not a litter box while you are traveling for extended periods of time. So when you buy this one don't throw out your old box because unfortunately you will have to use it for trips longer than 2 days or face the wraith of unhappy cats upon your return.,cats,2
"I purchased this mat to keep my cat from running out the front door. She had escaped a few times, and I was trying to find something to keep her in. I put the mat in front of the door, turned it on the lowest setting and waited. She ran down the stairs, and jumped on the mat. It shocked her, and she ran back up the stairs. She tried one more time, before she stopped going all the way down. We turned the mat off, and she hasn't tried to get out since.My only issue is that I bought the mat, only used it for 10 minutes, and now it is sitting on the floor.

"I would give this pet door a solid five stars for the door itself. It is attractive, durable, and far superior to any other pet door I have seen. I took a star off, however, because the installation instructions were very poor. The instructions we got didn't make sense on some points and when we called customer service, we were told those were the ""old"" instructions for an earlier model. They couldn't explain why they were put in with the ""new"" model we ordered. The instructions also told us to make a hole 1/8 inch larger than was actually needed. The customer service representative said that was because most people tend to make the hole too small. But isn't better to start off with a hole that is too small? You can always make it larger. If you followed these instructions, the hole would be too big, and there would be no way to make it smaller. That is especially important since this model pet door is installed in the wall of the house. I am very glad that we called before cutting a hole in our house that was too big! I whole-heartedly recommend this pet door, but be very careful when installing it that the manufacturer's instructions don't mess you up.",cats,2

"Bought this harness a few months ago for our Lab puppy who is now 7 months old. She loves to pull while on walks, but with this harness it reduces the pulling by 90-95%. It is amazing in regards to that. The only bad thing about it is it chafes her armpits and is causing her to lose her hair and get a pretty nasty rash/scab on the one armpit where the buckle is. We have it fitted correctly, but we can't use it everyday or her one armpit start bleeding.",dogs,3

Still every time the lid is opened he runs out though the doggy door and waits till his dish is filled and the lid on the container is closed then he comes in and eats. He is a very funny little guy. But his food is still pretty fresh in the container. Like it very much and can put a twist on the small loop at the top of the lid to make be sure no little critter(sometime a stray feild mouse wanders in-not often though) gets the munchies.,dogs,3

"This is an excellent product when a cat has tapeworm. I had taken in some stray kittens last year and noticed that they had tapeworm. Not having the money to take them to a vet, I saw the product on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try, BUT was in a hurry to get it so I bought it at one of the Pet supermarts rather than Amazon. It worked immediately. By the next day, there were no tapeworms visible in her stool. I was thrilled, but wished I had ordered it from Amazon and waited for delivery. I paid twice as much as I would have with Amazon. I won't make that mistake again.The only issue is that, as others have mentioned, it is difficult to get the cat to take the pill. I thought I would try crushing it up and putting it in some wet food, but that didn't work. Ended up having to wrestle with kitty to get the pill down.",cats,2
"I found out that I was pregnant two months after we took in a rescue cat. My husband and I love the cat, but neither one of us is much fond of cleaning the box. It became my job.

I wanted to share my satisfaction with the Teafco Fydo Action Collar. First of all my dogs wear these collars 24/7 and move with ease as if no collar was even present.....in other words they aren't bothered by the collar the least bit. In the past I have purchased collars that have rubbed the hair on their necks and ones that seemed to irritate them. The Fydo collar is lite weight and extremely functional in all conditions (wet or dry). I recommend this collar as an all around great buy. I have never seen these collars in pet stores and people always ask were I purchased mine.,dogs,3

"This bed isn't bad for the money. You get what you pay for. This bed was nothing but trouble to put together. It took more than an hour for my fiance, my sister, and myself to figure it out. The bars did not fit so we would get 3 sides put in and could not get the 4th in. We had to bend it a weird way to make it fit. The directions were NOT helpful at all either, they had poorly labeled pictures, and nothing else.Other than the serious trouble getting the bed put together, the bed isn't bad. It is very loud in the middle of the night when the dog gets up and down and shifts positions because of the material and the way her nails rubbed on it. We put a sheet on it and it solved the problem! I have a 85 pound Great Pyrenees and it sags quite a bit, so for a bigger dog I would get a larger size. Color was more of a hunter green and not the ugly green pictured, although that could just be my monitor settings.",cats,2

The trouble I had was that although it has a Y connection to allow me to use the faucet for other purposes, it does not have a on/off valve for that second spout. You must attach and disconnect the second hose each time you want to use it. This did not work for me as I use this faucet daily to water my garden. The dogs did get use to the spout with little effort. However, because it is on the deck I felt I needed to have a large bowl to catch the excess water and decrease the water waste on the deck. Overall, I have been happy with the waterer.",dogs,3
"I have this modified to accept the exhaust from a mobile air conditioner for my master bedroom which is windowless but has a patio door (ask the builder, I've given up trying to figure out why). It installs in minutes, is nice in appearance, and isn't flimsy at all. The lock could be a little sturdier, I added one for security sake.",cats,2

"I was sceptical at first...could any product get rid of the tear stains running down my beautiful white dog's face. I decided to give 'Angel Eyes' a try and in less than three weeks I could see a huge difference. The key is to stick with it. Even if you don't see results right away, don't stop using the product. It definitely works over time. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dog with tear stains!",dogs,3

"We initially started buying a similar product at the grocery store that did not rattle, and our cats loved them, but they didn't last long and the fur came off. Once I found these our cats went CRAZY over them! They carry them around, bat them down stairs and carry them back up to do it again. These mice are much more durable than the previous brand we bought so we don't go through quite as many. They have tons of other toys, they are very spoiled, but they insist on playing with these and only these mice. I've given them to friends for their cats and they go just as nuts over them!Great product, great price, great value!! Your cat will love them!!",cats,2

We'll be purchasing more of these in a month or two, once our dog gets through this bag.",dogs,3
"For some reason, my kitten does not play with this toy like he does with somany others I have purchased here. It doesn't crackle or squeak, so thatmay be the problem.

I received the fountain 3 weeks ago and cats are already big fans. They stopped jumping up to the sink and begging for water from faucet. Took them about 1 week to make the switch away from their bowls. The fountain is very quiet and was easy to set up.

"I love this product! I can exercise my dog for an hour throwing balls in the field and not wear myself out! The only complaint I have is it is a bit bulky to carry on my walk to the park, maybe a folding or collapsible model?

I use it with the rubberized balls, they seem to last longer and I get better distance than the ""tennis"" type balls.",dogs,3
"Unfortunately this product did nothing for my 5 cats who are still fussing with each other. I've tried 2 plugins going simultaneously, 1 on each floor of my house in open areas several times over the course of 2 years.... so there's been plenty of time for it to work. These cats are siblings who were raised together. I don't understand why the 2 females are still territorial, spraying wherever they want, and hissing at each other. hey were all neutered at 6 months, they all come and go through their cat door. Other people seem to have success with this product, but not us.",cats,2

"...I think. I mean, its effectiveness might be psycho-somatic but then again, it's for a dog and they don't usually fall for placebos. :-) Anyway, our dog is 11+ and has had trouble getting up the stairs (un-carpeted). Her paws are dry and cracked, so we've begun past few weeks to apply a little on each pad and after a few days, she did seem to have less problems getting up the stairs. Who knows, maybe her feet were sore, they were certainly dry and cracked. Still are, a little, but she's doing better on the steps. She doesn't like her paw pads touched, but knows she'll get a good treat if she lets us put the stuff on. So... for the purposed we bought the ointment for, it's been quite effective.",dogs,3

"My hyper active Jack Russel mix loves chewing up her beds but weirdly enough she won't chew on this one, which is awesome! It fits perfectly inside her Midwest kennel and she loves to sleep on it, she rests her head on the pillow edges, so cute!

Still a great buy and I will purchase it again, but next time I will not be buying the fleece one.",dogs,3
I had a difficult time deciding whether or not the bar spacing would be close enough to keep my two young parakeets in and the cat out. It is PERFECT! The quality of construction is very high the birds love it. If you have a parakeet that needs more room - this is THE cage for you to order. I highly recommend this cage and the vendor shipping was fast and reasonable! Thank you!,birds,0
"I was a little hesitant about buying it because there were mixed reviews about the item. It is easy to setup and once you follow the directions ON THE BOX it will remove the toxins from your water. I had it running for about 3 hours after receiving it and there was already brown mucky skimmate in the collection cup. The trick is to have the downflow on first before turning on the airstone so the bubbles mix more with the water. Also there is a line telling you where the bubbles are supposed to be, and where the water level is supposed to be. I highly recommend this product.",fish aquatic pets,4
"There are a plethora of disinfectants that you can choose to use for the shelter environment in terms of cleaning and disinfecting. Disinfectants can come in my shapes and sizes, including costs and modes of application. Until very recently it was very common to look only at the method of cleaning and the steps followed to reach sanitation. But now it is becoming more and more important to not only look at the method and steps to reach sanitation, but also the disinfectant used and the way it is applied.First there are your quart products namely called Quaternary Ammonium Compounds which are a disinfectant/detergent based disinfectant. These products are great for your standard cleaning of surfaces such as walls, but in terms of destroying infectious pathogens in the shelters, they ultimately fail. They are only effective against enveloped viruses such as Feline Herpes Virus. Quart products are not at all effective against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus and calcivirus which are your more deadly viruses that are hard to kill.Then there are your Potassium Peroxymonosulfate products which are your Trifectant and Virkon. Potassium Peroxymonosulfate the main ingredient in Trifectant is the gold standard in eliminating Feline Calcivirus, Feline Herpes Virus and canine parvo virus in shelters due to its great activity against organic matter and ease of application. Despite that, a pre-cleaning step with detergent mix and brushing along with rinsing is always advised to remove as much organic matter as possible before using this product. This is true with any disinfectant. With the pre-cleaning step and Trifectant being applied the right way, you will find that this does the job very accurately and leaves a better scent than bleach does.Before you can trust this product, lets realize how URI is spread. It is somewhat airborne, cats can sneeze five feet. But is is mainly fomite contacted which means it is spread by food bowls, water bowls, litter boxes and stainless steel cages improperly cleaned between cats. Any item that is touched and touched again. This is why you need this product.Please note that different situations call for different disinfectants such as in the case of ringworm. But for daily cleaning I would choose this product over anything. It lasts for seven days for each solution. It is a great deal for a great price. I use this at home to disinfect everything between my regular cats and foster and will use it to sanitize the foster cage in-between litters.This product is the best.",dogs,3

Since his bed is in the foyer and on ceramic tile, we added a heating pad and his own infra-red heater for additional comfort in cold weather. I give this product 5 stars.",dogs,3
"When they say ""small"" in the title, they do mean small. Very small. The toy fits across the palm of my hand. I have large dogs, this is like a cat toy to them. It seems relatively sturdy, we'll have to see how it holds up. I gave it three stars because it is well-constructed, and you do get extra squeakers. But just note that this is a very, very small toy, so don't bother if you have anything larger than a Chihuahua.",dogs,3
"Bought this for a teething 8-week-old border collie puppy. She really likes things that make a ""crinkle"" noise, so I figured this would be fun for her. She played with it for about 30 seconds, put it down, and never looked at it again. And this is a puppy that will bite and chew ANYTHING she sees. I tried to play tug-of-war with her with this, and she was very disinterested with it.The ""crinkly"" noise is very slight & soft--definitely nothing loud enough to keep a high-energy dog like a border collie engaged.Might be fun for extremely young pups (maybe 3-5 weeks?), or very sensitive/easily-scared dogs, but if you have a pup that really likes gnawing on stuff and making a lot of noise, look elsewhere :)",dogs,3

The plastic is think and hard, so when he would roll it from side to side it made a loud noise from the impact on our hard floors.I think it would work better with carpeted homes. Also, it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out, so I would say this is an 'advanced' toy.",dogs,3
"I purchased this collar with the hopes of using it to train my little dog. The collar does work, it does get the dogs attention, but my dog quickly got used to the vibration. Now when I ""buzz"" her, she shakes her head and keeps on doing whatever it was I was telling her not to. The tone is ok, not loud as others have already stated. I'm going back to clicker training and hope that the positive reinforcement will work better for me then the collar did. The other issue I had is the remote is quite large, I wish it had a clasp or lanyard.",dogs,3
"We have 2 full-size pugs that enjoy their new pen. At first I was skeptical if they would not lean on the sides and knock it over as Mini Me weighs 18 pounds and Lexi weighs approximately 12 pounds. They can stand up and lean on the sides with no problem. Currently, I have it in the kitchen so they can watch me cook and clean and it works out great. It is light enough to take down when not in use. I like their new pen because the top is open and I can reach down and pet them and give them their treats without having to open the door constantly. It is large enough that their large bed fits great in the pen with plenty of room also for their play toys. They can watch me work but yet are not under my feet while cleaning. I highly recommend this pen.",dogs,3

We fill it with dry food mixed with layers of peanut butter, yogurt, chicken jerky, and other goodies, it will last him more than 20 minutes, even longer if frozen.

It's very sturdy, made of metal, and very easy to use--a little intimidating when you first remove it from the package though. I wondered if it would scrape his skin too much, but it doesn't seem to scrape him at all.

Never in using the two items did I have anexperience removing the plastic cylinder that it didn't break apart when replacing the unitWhat a revolting mess. The unit itself is flimsy. The Litter Champ is much more direct--no twising of the plastic, so no breaking and the plastic is much sturdier--cleaner, moreefficient, no odor due to breakage--an all-around better product.",cats,2

"This has really been a life saver for me. I have two dogs. one is an English Setter with long hair on his paws, and it does a great job of cleaning them! My Jack is too little to get into it.The trick is to train them to be still while you dip their paws in the unit. I dip, squeeze the excess water from his paw and have the towel ready to dry, and he is such a good boy that he even turns around and lifts his back legs up for me..BUT...!I can totally see the reviews in regards to it being too heavy and hard to use, because it really is! My wife and sister (when she watches the dogs) will not use it, they both say that it is too heavy and cumbersome for them. I just muscle through it and call it good.I have since took the idea and made my own, lighter and smaller version that will work for my Jack Russell as well.GREAT!!! idea, just needs some tweaking. If you don't mind a little work it really is better then standing there for 10 mins cleaning mud from between their toes when this does it in a few secs. In the summer it doesn't get used because the garden hose is WAY easier.Hope this helps!",dogs,3

"Our sporting group dogs with the floppy ears have always had ear canal problems. When we got our Golden puppy 3 and a half years ago I decided to try to try to keep it from happening again. This product came highly recommended, and our vet said that it was a good product for what we wanted to do. We put a shot in each of her ears a couple times a week and so far she's had no problems at all. 5 stars for that. On the other hand, it smells nasty. They say it has a ""green apple"" smell, but that's just a nice way to say that it smells like vinegar. And if you let it get outside of the ear into the hair it leaves behind a greasy mess that's nearly impossible to clean up. But of course that's the same property that makes it do the job so well inside the ear, so I guess you can't have it all. The Golden doesn't like it when we put it in, but I'm not sure that she would like anything that we shot into her ear, and I can't blame her. Bottom line",cats,2
"I thought these would be great for one of my cats, who loves curled up pipe cleaners. Unfortunately, when he plays with those he stretches them out.

"Either they recently changed the programming functions for this unit, or the people reviewing that complain about difficulties with programming it are new to electricity.I bought the medium size (10 lb hopper) version of this unit. Setup was extremely easy and quick! You set the current time, then you set the time and amount of food you want to feed for up to three meals per day. Took about five minutes take it out of the box, put the batteries in, fill it with food, and program it. It also has a place to plug in an AC adapter, however you will need to buy the adapter yourself. It is a little light overall -- I wouldn't mind if they had made the base a little heavier as I can imagine that my dogs might figure out how to tip this over. I'll have to monitor this and might have to secure it somehow if they get smart. :-)I set the meals to feed 3/4 cup. Using the manual feed function I tested the unit and measured what it spit-out. It was right-on at 3/4 cup every time.This thing is pretty cool and will make it much easier for our house/pet sitter when we are out of town. Recommended.--------UPDATE 12/26/08-----------We have gone back to regular bowls to feed our three dogs because this unit seemed to be causing one of our lhasa apsos a bit too much stress. She LOVES food and would lay by the automatic feeder ALL day long waiting for the next time it would dispense. I'm not kidding - all day!We also had a problem with ants while we were using this because it leaves a fine powder of dry food underneath the unit when it dispenses, which we didn't realize until the hopper was full of ants.I still think this is a good product that would work well for a one dog household, when you are out-of-town, and a pet-sitter is watching your dog and you want to make sure they get the right amount of food.",cats,2

"First of all, lemme say i have never written a bad review like this before and i don't do it lightly.I wouldn't recommend buying this product at any price. It's basically defective by design.Here's the issues:1. They use a propeller type water pump which means it clogs easily and doesn't bleed the air out automatically. When air gets into a water pump system is ""chatters"" like garbage disposal. The loud sound makes it a poor choice if it's going to be in normal living quarters.2. Because the propeller pump and setup clogs easily they had to make it easy to take apart for cleaning. The problem is that it also makes it leak easily. They also say in the instructions that not cleaning voids warranty. So you have to take it apart, put it back together AND THEN recheck, refit to prevent leaking each time you clean it.3. The switch designed to control the speed of the water flow isn't a switch at all. It doesn't slow water pump, it bottlenecks the water intake. This bottleneck valve causes water turbulence which cause more air bubbles to get into system for more noise.The price doesn't matter ... the only way this product is usable in a normal home room is if you remove water bottleneck valve completely. Then you should also replace the water pump with an inline pump. That's $40 bucks for a new pump plus all the time it's gonna take you to retrofit the new pump and line.Basically doubling the price of this Drinkwell product.i suppose if your going to put it in a basement or garage where leaking and noise don't matter, then this could work.But a noisy and leaky pet bowl doesn't work in any normal home room.",cats,2

"This harness is pretty great, all things considered. To be honest, I am usually wary ordering products for my dogs online (aside from leashes) because my two dogs - a blue merle pomeranian and a pekingese/pug mix - are a little unusual in the size department. I bought this particular harness for my pomeranian because our local store has been out for weeks, and it really wasn't worth the trip over an hour away to the nearest pet specialty store.While it is a little small for my dog, that is not necessarily the product's fault at all. I like that the straps are not too thick, and the color is great - I love purple, and it goes well with her fur color. It is also fairly easy to adjust.There are a couple of things that I do not like, and they are as follows:* The hook where you attach the leash is plastic instead of metal like most harnesses I have purchased in the past. I worry that it will break, but since my dog is small, I do not think I will have to worry about that.* The clasp is VERY tight. It is hard to push it in if you are putting the harness back on, and it is very hard to squeeze the sides in when you need to take it off. I am not sure if this is the case with every harness, but it is an issue for me - especially with little fingers and not much muscle behind them!All in all, it is a great harness. The issues that I have are really minor inconveniences for me, and they are pretty easy to work through especially if you have an extra pair of hands. I would absolutely recommend this harness.",dogs,3

Please follow the instructions carefully on how to put this on your dog, it must be tight but if properly applied will not hurt your dog.

The liner is not round, it is rectangular and it's barely big enough to fold over the top edge - MAYBE you get a half inch, but once your kitty starts doing his thing, the plastic WILL shift and you WILL get litter under the liner. And then what good is it?? I purchased extra large DRAWSTRING liners from Target - these fit great, they have plenty of extra room to fold over the top and the drawstring helps keep it in place while it's on the dome, and then it makes for an easy clean up.

Another bonus is that as she ages it helps her joints so she moves like a young dog even though she's now 12 years old. We started giving her a tablespoon of it every day from the time we got her as a 6 month old pup, and she laps it up like candy.",dogs,3
"I've seen the item. It's great. The trouble is with sitstay.com, I ordered two of these crates through Amazon which was supplied by sitstay.com. I paid for the order and it showed pending on my credit card. Two days later I received an email sitstay.com cancelled the order because it was out-of-stock. Right then I inquired to find the crates were still available through Amazon and sitstay.com. Later I followed up with Darcie in the Customer Service Department and found they had been in stock the whole week before. Now they want me to redo my order with sitstay (not Amazon) at a higher price. They won't honor the other price they say because it was through Amazon. Beware!!!",dogs,3
Arrived as described. Assembly was easy if u had the right tools and a extra hand. Kennel is a little flimsy but that's what is expected from a 250 dollar kennel. Hopefully it doesn't fail in time with my dog.,dogs,3

"I bought this thinking it would be good to quiet down our Westie. Before trying it on her, I put one thumb on each lead and activated it and SZZZZZT OUCH! I could never inflict such pain on our little girl. I returned it (and thank you Amazon for paying return shipping).",dogs,3
I'm glad I finally ordered this since using a LitterMaid for over ten years. We have very limited space in our 550 square foot apartment so anything added makes it more claustrophobic. We put it under the LitterMaid so that only a third of the carpet is in use and it still works great and my two kitties like it. A good purchase.,cats,2
"Cleared up my pet's itching. It's not gotten rid of the redness of her skin, but she doesn't scratch as much for a couple of days after use. I just wish I could bathe her more often without potentially causing more skin irritation. It also smells nice. Sprays don't seem to help her very much, but this definitely does. I'll probably be buying another bottle soon. Just make sure you let it sit on the coat for at least 10 minutes. My pooch has gotten impatient once or twice, and we ended up rinsing early. It doesn't work as well if you rinse it out too soon.",dogs,3
"I am glad that Amazon asked me to rate this product. I recently purchased Frontline for my two dogs and my cat. I have used it for a month and a half. The results are mixed. While my one rescued Black Lab, Molly, has a reduced number of fleas and is growing hair back. The veterinarian said it was caused by chewing lice, which this product is supposed to kill. However, I do not see any results in my other dog, Saddie - in fact, her flea infestation has increased. I also still see fleas on the cat as well. I was under the impression, from the product spokes person I spoke to, that the fleas would be killed in 24 to 48 hours. It has been two application or about a month and a half and like I have stated the results are okay at best. One of the main reasons I used the Frontline products was, I was told, that their competitors could be unsafe if the cat groomed the dog, which she does.",dogs,3
"This time, I bought two. I bought one the first time and my cats had to take turns playing with them. Another low-overhead, high-productivity invention. My cats LOVE this toy. It is so comfortable for me because I don't have to move it around. All I do is straighten the wire a bit, turn it upside down so the end is facing up, and let the cats swat at it all day. They like the bouncing up action and I think it reminds them of a flying bug because my one cat starts clinking his teeth together and that means he's ready to attack some prey. I believe their verticals have improved about 12"" since we've purchased this toy. For such a low price, this is the only toy you need - ever - for an interactive playtime that will exhaust your cat until he gives up and slumps down to a deep sleep.",cats,2
"I love it, it reduced dog hair shedding by 80%, it's amazing! no matter how much do I use it, the dog hair just keeps coming out (means less on the floors).Only gripe I have it that it's a pain as it takes about 20 mintues to do it, I do it once every few weeks, but no pain no gain.",cats,2

"Great for dogs! My dog loves playing Frisbee but he doesn't like catching the normal, harder Frisbees so this one is a great alternative and it flies really well. If you have a really powerful dog he may chew through it really easily but for my dog they're definitely worth it.",dogs,3
"My Sheltie, Robbie, was given this as a gift & loves it! The funniest part is that he thought the ball was saying ""Bobby"" to him when it says ""puppy"" & startled him!

The battery ran out & I just rush ordered another, plus a spare. Didn't know you could replace the battery.",dogs,3
These were very expensive (we got 2 of them). Gave for Christmas presents and the dogs have already chewed holes in them (3 days later). I would not recommend this product. Needs to be made of more sturdy rubber.,dogs,3
I had my doubts about this item. I was afraid it would cut the hair. It doesn't seem to do that. I have several long haired dogs.

I bought one of these docks for my turtle a really long time ago and it lasted for 5+ years. Then it just seemed too slimy so i decided to throw it out and get my turtle a fresh one. As soon as I opened the box i could tell that the quality was so much cheaper than the original one I had. The raft itself started flaking off as soon as i touched it. At the same time it felt super greasy. I didnt really want to expose my turtle to anything that would flake off into the water so i tried rinsing it off and pretty much got no where. The plastic bars that attach to the suction cups seemed like the crappiest plastic I've ever seen or touched. The original one was much sturdier. The suction cups were separated in the packaging and required some assembly prior to use. As I was putting the suction cups onto the plastic bars I kept wondering how long this dock would last b/c the quality seemed so terrible. The suction cups were very difficult to attach and within a few seconds the plastic bar snapped into two pieces. So annoying. I can't believe this company would lower the quality of this item so much since 5 years ago. Too bad.,fish aquatic pets,4

"I've tried all kinds of stuff to get rid of pet orders, including urine, which is the worst of all. All that other crap does is cover up the smell temporarily, and then the urine smell comes back even stronger. I always wondered why. Order is caused by bacteria. Urine bacteria is one of the worst. Even when it dries out is smells. When it's wet the bacteria grows more and so more smell. Anti Ichy Poo, (what a name) right? What it does is kill the bacteria. It's a formula that eats the bacteria. We have two small puppies, and they are worst to potty train. So we have corners in the house that have been urinated on quite a bit. We even put pads there for them. They hit the pads sometimes and sometimes they miss. Anyway the urine smell was bad. You could smell it when you entered the room. I found Anti-Ichy-Poo by accident on the internet and read the reviews so had to try. Folks! This stuff does work. It doesn't clean the stains, but it does kill the smell. We recently bought a Bissell cleaner to clean the stains and now we're all set. We walk into the room and the smell is totally gone. It's great stuff. I don't generally right reviews for anything, but I am sold on this. Thanks",cats,2
This is a wonderful product. My cats loved it even before I put their litterbox in it. As a house with three cats and nine dogs its important to stay as clean as possible. This product does not allow litter to escape the box and my cats took right to going in and out of the opening to use it. As all dogs are over sixty pounds but one the opening is small even that my dogs can not sneak into the box to explore. The second roof is also helpful as I keep the cat treats their and their food on the top shelf. The closed in box also keeps the smell down. I would suggest this product to anyone with any number of cats escecially someone with a multiple cat home.,cats,2
Tear staining is a natural oxidizing process where the enzymes in the tears react with air and natural bacteria on the skin. This product contains a low dose antibiotic called Tylosin that disrupts this normal physiology. You are literally 'treating' your dog with a daily dose of antibiotic. It is not considered responsible use of antibiotics by many veterinarians. The safety of long term use of antibiotics like this have not been properly studied and are likely to cause long term effects. This is why many people have reported GI signs in the reviews. The best thing you can do to reduce tear staining is gently wipe the area with warm water every morning as well as routine grooming. If tear staining continues to be a major issue for you - DO NOT GET A WHITE DOG NEXT TIME.,dogs,3

"Our French Basset is not a finicky eater, in fact, she will eat almost anything she can get into her mouth. But, she has an allergic reaction to a broad range of ingredients commonly found in dog food; the result is we have relatively few choices of foods we can provide to her. Most of the dog food we can provide is reminiscent of unappetizing hospital food. Well, that is, until we found Merrick canned dog food. I suspect if you took some Merrick canned dog food out of a can, put it into a soup bowl and warmed it up, you could serve it and any human would happily eat it and ask for more. Needless to say, our dog loves it (as does my son's Australian Kelpie) and, having read the ingredients, we feel good about providing it to her. So far, over the last several months, we have served her Merrick's French Caf&eacute; and Cowboy Cook Out. Her health excels, there have been no indications of allergic reaction, she licks the bowl clean and we feel good about what we are feeding her.",dogs,3
"One day, I noticed my cat was limping around. I thought something had happened to him (i.e. he fell from somewhere, etc.), so I took him to the vet. The vet felt his legs, told me he has arthritis pretty badly, and send me home with a bottle of Cosequin.Just a few days after adding it to his food, my cat's arthritis was much lessened. Cosequin is not a *perfect* solution, but far better",cats,2
I bought the catit drinking fountain over a year ago and for the past 6 months have let it sit unused. It is much harder to fill than a Drinkwell and if the angle isn't just right it only comes out of one side of the fountain....sometimes the motor is louder than other times. There is no rhyme or reason for it. You cannot clean the inside of the resevoir so I can only imagine how slimy it is. I have 8 eight cats and I have two Drinkwell Fountains already - one that I purchased in 2002 is still going. So if you want a fountain - don't go with this one. It was a complete waste of money.,cats,2

"My Lab and I take this bumper to the beach with us. It's a great toy for fetch in the water - floats, easy to spot and easy to clean off.Oh, and as the description says, this is not a chew toy. My mischievous pup got this out of our toy box one evening as I was cooking. He was able to chew off the rope and part of the orange plastic (granted, he is a very determined chewer) within a short time. The orange plastic seemed to come off in crumbles which could be easily swallowed. Use it for play and fetch only and this durable bumper should last a long time.",dogs,3

"The toy has a very strong bad plastic smell. My 9 week old puppy has had the toy for a week. He has not interest in getting close to it. I am sure it is the smell.I moved the toy from the room because it smelled so bad.

The bones are suppose to reduce tartar by 83%. My puppy does some heavy chewing on the bones.Update 8-6-2009:My dog is now playing a little bit with the toy.

"I switched from an omega paw roll n clean litter box. I loved that box because it sifted through the crap without me having to do the dirty work. I decided to try out the crystal litter since my cat tracks litter like crazy. With crystal litter you have to dispose of all the litter when you replace it, so I switched to this box. Less tracking, and I can put a garbage (30gal) bag in it to dispose of the litter. Regular 13 gal trash bags dont fit, so just buy the large 30gal ones and youll be fine. Easy to dispose of old litter. No dust!I have since gone back to regular litter-- my cat did not take kindly to the crystal litter. He not uses this box exclusively and hasnt made business in his old box since. Tracking is very minimal, and my large male persian cat fits inside this fine. Surprisingly enough, this box seems to smell less than his other box, which is confusing since his old box had a covered top. He had a problem not burying his duty, but with this one it seems like he buries it whether or not he tries to. Great purchase. The adjustment period was problematic, but has THANKFULLY passed.",cats,2
"I am not unhappy with the product, which seems to help with joint pain and even gets your pet to eat more of the food it is mixed in with, but the seller is a running one of the worse businesses I've ever dealt with. Be aware that absolutelypets.com (also doing business as mypetdrugstore.com - never a good sign) charges your credit card when the order is placed, then delays shipping the order for some reason. When you call to check the status of your order, you will be told it was 'lost in shipping' and that there is no tracking number. A later email from them told me they had TRACKED the parcel, but it was still lost. How can you track a parcel without a tracking #? You will then be told that the parcel is to be re-shipped 'in a few days', but no such 2nd shipment is made.If you sign an agreement to accept credit cards, you can not charge a card until the parcel is within a day of shipping. I suppose if you wanted to get around this you'd use the 'lost shipping' or some other excuse - but why not just take orders and send them out?",cats,2

"my 8 month old pups luv to be outside, no matter what the weather, so i was looking for something that would get them off of the ground - out of the mud/dirt & rain. this product seemed to fit this need. assembly was a little tricky, because the fabric was tight and once all was together the completed unit had a little twist. once placed with all 4 legs on the ground, the bed straightened out. it took a couple trys, but both dogs got used to getting up and laying down on the raised bed. one dog truly likes this bed and lays on it the majority of the time. the other uses it less. the fabric is tough, as the pups tried to tear it apart, but they only suceeded in fraying a couple edges and not chewing threw it, so the beds are both fully functional.",cats,2
This is not made of super strong material so if your dog chews everything this is not the toy for your dog. IF your dog is a problem-solver this is perfect!

"This is one of those products that I have a hard time believing this many people love or swear by it. I kept putting this off and putting this off, its one of those too good to be true things. But after reading alot of reviews and being really tired of cleaning up after my wife's cats during her recovery from an injury, I thought I'd try it out.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY !!!! Yes, it looks cool and works okay to begin with, but the honeymoon ends quickly, within a day or two. The unit does not handle urine well, especially if you have a larger cat that makes large messes, the rake doesn't seem to be able to move the clumps in one piece. It even has a problem with solid waste. The rakes leaves behind bits and pieces as it moves along. I found that most of the time, the clumps from urine were still soggy and nasty to deal with while following the advice of other users and emptying out the recpticals instead of throwing them away to save money. I did this because the replacement recepticals are extremely expensive and other users said that cleaning them after use was easy. What a joke!! The recepticals are made of very thin plastic and very difficult to snap out of place and back into place with splattering the waste around while you working with the receptical.After a frustrating 3 weeks with the box, I gave it to my sister who has younger, smaller cats, thinking it might work better for her since she didn't have a large mess maker. She had the same results...frustration. After reading some more reviews online, I think maybe the designers should allow for more time to let the clumping of waste finish. I also think that they should design the box with a more powerful motor to move the waste. Please take my advice and the advice of those who have had negative opinions and experiences with this product. Save yourself the money and frustration. Take the easier route to ""self-cleaning"" and teach you cat to use the toilet !!!",cats,2

"These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst! - KV Pet Supply has the best online price- $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!",dogs,3
"I found myself down in Ulster County, NY which is a tick haven. 2 golden retrievers and a bunch of ticks don't mix. Without any tick protection and or a tick remover, I ended up at a pet store looking at options. They were out of the style I had at home, the one that is like a pair of small plastic diagonal cutters with a magnifier. They had a tick spoon with a little slot and this aluminum key looking thingy called the ""tick Key"". Both same price. I asked the clerk which one and she said they sell a ton of the tick keys. So I bought one.Over the course of the next 4 days I had to pull about 5 embedded ticks off my dogs and let me tell you, this thing is the ticket. You simply move the dog's hair aside as much as possible, slide the slot down over the ticks body as close to the skin as you can, and then pull to the side in a steady fashion. Don't rip the tick out, just keep steady pressure until it lets go. Worked perfect every time. The narrowing slot applies pinching pressure and the steady sideways tug makes them give way. The key itself is light, durable, and easy to store since it is flat.I ended up buying 3 more. One for home and one for each vehicle, along with one for my in-laws. Great product!",dogs,3

"I am very disappointed with the ScoopFree Self Cleaning litter box. It is not scoop free and it is not self cleaning. I have two adult cats and I knew the litter trays wouldn't last the advertised month but I had hoped it would last two weeks. I am finding that after 3-4 days I cannot stand the odor. The grate pushes waste into the enclosed box but it also pulls some behind the grate. There is always some left in the litter. Every 3-4 days I use a plastic utensil and scrape out the piled up waste from behind the grate and pull out the waste left in the enclosed box and scoop it out. It is a long and tedious job. It also defeats the purpose of self cleaning. I purchased this item because I have a bad back and leaning over to clean out the litter box is very difficult and painful. I now have to do it every few days and longer at a time. I have been replacing the trays after 7 days because I can no longer stand the odor. I also have had to replace litter during the week. I will soon be getting a new, regular litter box and go back to the way I was cleaning it. This is a lot of money wasted.",cats,2
"My daughter bought this recently from Amazon. I was hesitant, as I had read a review that stated how narrow the walk-thru was. Since this looked to be the best to fit our needs...letting the cat get down the hallway to her food and litter box, without letting the dogs in, she bought this one. Have to tell you, I'm not small, not huge, but definitely a plus size senior citizen. The senior citizen fat cat and I both go through easily. As both the utility room and my bedroom are at the end of the rather long hall, this door sees plenty of action. I was also pleasantly surprised by how nice the gate looked when installed. Huge improvement over the wood and mesh expansion baby gate, that I had cut a hole in to let the cat through, and had to move every time I wanted to go down the hall. Both of our dogs are mid-sized, in the 50-60 lb. range, and neither has shown any desire to attempt that little cat door. I really love this gate, and so does the cat!!Just one word of advice. Someone earlier also recommended that you not cut the fastener holding the doorway closed, until after installation. If there are two of you doing this, absolutely, leave it secure until you're finished. If you are installing alone, like I was, I found it very convenient to be able to use the opened door to prop the gate up while I was playing with the adjusting rods. That may just be me, but I thought I would share that with you. I also found the instructions to be clear, and the gate was very easy to install.",dogs,3

"And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.",dogs,3

"I bought this filter for my 10 gallon freshwater tank. We have cory cats who like to dig in the substrate so I put sand in. The sand looks wonderful and the fish love it but it has killed 5 different power filters so we finally caved and got a canister filter. Not wanting to pay a ton nor needing anything huge we bought this filter. The only complaint I have about it is that the bag that the carbon comes in is useless so I switched the carbon into a nylon knee high (be sure to use a brand new, never been washed nylon or you will kill your fish, been there done that!) and it works wonderfully. We have 3 albino cat fish, 2 otos, and two platys. They are dirty fish! I had previously been having ammonia issues with power filters (probably due to the fact they kept clogging up with sand!) but since putting this filter in we have PERFECT water tests and this past water change had been two weeks (I usually do weekly) with still no rise in chemicals and hardly cloudy water. Best part? The filter is SILENT, honestly our air pump is louder. My only other complaint is minor, the directions as to where to connect the tubes are a little confusing. I believe you want to have the water being pushed out the tube with the little holes on it that runs on the back of the tank horizontal and the water coming in the straight rod that runs vertical so I had to switch that after it was running but all better now!UPDATE",fish aquatic pets,4
"The door is well made and very easy to install. Installs very nicely on hollow door with the telescoping frame. My only wish is that there be a size slightly larger to accomodate my large cat. The next size up is way too big. But my cat manages (barely) with this small door, depending on his hunger!",dogs,3
"First of all, this ""house"" is incredibly small. Only a small kitten would not feel cramped when going inside. I feel bad for the cat pictured on the box looking through the little window in the back.Second, the setup isn't that easy. It's not extraordinarily difficult, but it takes a while! The hooks don't go in right, they don't attach to the walls like they should, and the walls fall out after a while if they're not being held! The roof too. You'll probably need more than one person for this setup if you're still going to buy it.I give it more than one star because it's pretty and probably comfortable for the cats.",cats,2
"I admit, the reason I bought this toy was because it was so cute. Fortunately, my dog seems to like it as much as I do. She loves anything nylabone, and this was no exception.

The durability of nylabone toys continues to surprise me, even in the face of a super destructive chewer.",dogs,3
"I do highly recommend this product for dogs with any arthric pain,I do the method of 3 caspules a day for a 55 pound dog,I will stay on this does till I see physical changes in a dog,less limping/easier getting up persay,at this point when I do see less limping/easier getting up up to 75% at least I then will lower dosage to 2 capsules a day,when and if I see even better results I then will go to a steady dosage of 1 capsule a day,,,,though if limping/difficulty getting up increases,I will jump back up to 2 capsules a day,the dosage will always depend on how well the dog is doing,when their are NO benefits with this product it is absolutely a trip to the vets for further testing,,you can always go up to 4 capsules a day also and then start lowering dosage till your dog is 100% where they are happy/less pain,,,but needless to say if your dog is not getting better please seek the advice of your Veterinarian,best of luck.",dogs,3

"I got this toy for my 16-year-old nanday conure, who enjoys chewing up wood blocks. The toy looks fairly small next to the conure in the picture, but in real life, this is a pretty full toy. I appreciate that it has two hooks so I can string it across my parrot's play-stand and between her play-stand and cage, which is a nice alternative to toys that dangle straight down. Bonus that my bird was terrified of this toy like she is most things... she actually walked right up to it and started nibbling! Judging from the amount of blocks and how long it takes her to wear out toys, this ought to last her at least six months.",birds,0

"I thought that the furminator would work, but not like I saw in the picture of the cat. I tried it on my Tabby cat and the furminator took off as much fur as in the picture of the cat that was on the link below. I also have a long-haired mixed breed cat, which I used it on and it did not take off as much fur. I bought the furminator because I have a new daughter-n-law and one of my son's girfiend are allergic to cats; so I did not want them to get sick when they came to my house. I was pleasently suprise with the amount of fur that came off my cats and not shedding fur around the house. I have been washing all the sofa and chair coverings that were full of cat hair.

I currently have 7 of these and some are 3 years old and still going. I have not had one stop working on me.If you put it on and your dog still barks alot, you need to tighten an notch. If it still does not stop, tighten one more notch. I think some people may not be putting it on tight enough for thick coats.I do not think this is cruel at all. Dogs need boundaries.I take the collars off during the day and it has modified thier behavior tremendously.Also, if you buy the batteries from Amazon you will save a lot and they for some reason last longer.",dogs,3
My dog was able to destroy this in 3 minute. She was able to chew it to pieces in that time. I am glad that I was sitting there watching. She could have choked on some of the many pieces had not taken from her. The company that made this toy should be sued for endangering peoples pets.,cats,2

I wanted to share my satisfaction with the Teafco Fydo Action Collar. First of all my dogs wear these collars 24/7 and move with ease as if no collar was even present.....in other words they aren't bothered by the collar the least bit. In the past I have purchased collars that have rubbed the hair on their necks and ones that seemed to irritate them. The Fydo collar is lite weight and extremely functional in all conditions (wet or dry). I recommend this collar as an all around great buy. I have never seen these collars in pet stores and people always ask were I purchased mine.,dogs,3

"The tags on our dogs harnesses were quite annoying at night because they get up and wander about sometimes. It wasn't a huge problem until we had our son sleeping in a bassinet in our room.

I have just thrown away my 3rd drinkwell fountain. Although my cats love the fresh H2O and the running stream....the motors burn out. I have had 2 motors fail in the past 8 months! Of course the item SHOULD be covered under the 1 yr warranty.....EXCEPT if you have hard water....tough luck for you- not covered. Believe me I cleaned these fountains every 3 weeks and changed the filters also.....BUT.... the motors still failed. So if you have hard water-watch out.I'm going to try another brand and will review that in the future.,cats,2
"Bought this for my small dog that has knee problems. Love everything about it except the front wheel and the instructions to put it together. I had to have my son put the wheels on for me. The front wheel once attached, will not let me turn when I push the stroller. It turns by hand, but not when pushing the stroller. My son see's no way to fix this design problem. As long as I'm pushing the stroller in a straight line, it rolls fine. The only way I can make a turn, is to lift up the stroller off it's front wheel and turn/pivot the stroller on the two back wheel. Has anyone found a way to fix this problem? Other than that, I love the stroller, and so did everyone who saw it. I can leave the back unzipped and rolled up allowing my dog to get in and out when she wants, keeping her leash on, when out for a walk. The green color is almost a lime green shade, not a soft green. I'll probably get a new stroller that actually has a front wheel that turns, but they cost so much more money, I'll keep this one for now.PattyUpdate - 2013Frustrated with the front wheel that wouldn't turn when pushing the stroller, I was ready to sell it and buy something else. As a last result, my son again tried to figure out how to make it work. He ended up sanding the part that is attached to the wheel, that attaches to the stroller. He sprayed some kind of lubricate on it too, then put the front wheel back on. Now the wheel turns easily when pushing the stroller. Only one problem now, when I lift the front wheel off the ground, to fold it or to go up a curb, the front wheel falls off and I have to put it back on. Maybe he sanded it too much? Anyway as long as I keep the front wheel on the ground, it works good.",dogs,3

"My two babies were so scared of this gigantic alien of a litter box. My little female held it so long that finally she peed on a backpack on the floor. The male cat used it once or twice but would rather pee on a couch or clothing than in the box. To return it, I had to call customer service 3 times to get the return number. Then I paid $93 regular shipping to send it back. They have a $60 deal with Fedex. Why would you have a return rate set up with Fedex if you didn't get a ton of returns. I learned a $90 lesson. thanks for nothing Litter robot!",cats,2
"I have to admit - I was skeptical. My wife read about the Furminator online and showed me some of the reviews. Typically,what you read and what you get are two different things. Obviously, being the male, I knew I would lose any argument about getting it once she decided that it was the greatest thing invented. Between you and I - she was right. Well, not 'greatest' thing ever, but certainly the best dog product we have ever purchased. The furmintator is easy to use and will amaze you with the amount of hair it will remove in one stroke. We have 2 Labs and both seem to enjoy getting brushed. It is amazing when we are done - the pile of hair is nearly as big as they are (a slight exaggeration - but still a lot of hair). This is easy to use and does exactly what it says. If you have walking hair balls like we do - this is a must purchase.",cats,2
"I bought this system for my daughters Mini-Pin who always had to be taken out on a leash or he would run away. ""Oscar"" was so stubborn, and he would NEVER come when you called him if he managed to get free from his leash. Mini-Pins are very active and even though he did well inside the house, we felt he needed more freedom to play and exercise. The last straw came when he almost got hit in the road and it made me so upset I immediately called a local animal shelter to see if they knew any groups who might take him. They suggested the Petsafe system. I knew we could never use an inground system due to alot of asphalt, so this seemed to be the answer. I bought it one day and after 3 or 4 days of training, Oscar knew exactly what his boundaries were and wouldnt cross them even for a pork chop. I always recommend this system to others and what is even better about it is the portability. My daughter and son- in- law go camping and can now take the dog since the Petsafe can do the job there as well. Its been a long time since I have been so happy with a product. Love it, Love it!!",dogs,3
"This is my dog's favorite ball to fetch. She's able to catch the hollee roller in her mouth and carry it around.

It took two years of chewing and gnawing to chew through her holee roller so we replaced it at that time.",dogs,3
"I am on my second lighting system. I had the first over 2 years with no problems. I would still have the first set but I to sell it with my aquarium when I moved. I have read bad reviews on this product but I have had no issues with these lights at all.Things to consider:First off, if you are thinking of these make sure the clear caps are tight. I have found checking them sometimes you will get one that is not tight and it will not seal thus leaking water into the light. This of course will shorten the lights life rather quickly.Second they only make 4 colors. Red, Green, Blue, and Red. So if you see an advertised light of a different color from someone, its not correct. Not sure how or why they dont correct it on the ad, not that hard to do. They use to make a laser system with different colors and also rotating colors but I have not seen that for sometime now.Finally, if you leave them on for hours on end like I do, they will grow algea over the top of the clear lens. I use Q-Tips to just clean them off and they are good again.Other thoughts:The first lighting system I had I had to replace only 1 of my 5 lights in the 2 years due to it was just wore out. I am sure my second system will get plenty of use.Also I would like to note that Miraclebeam no longer shows this system on their website so I would question how long they will be available or if you need or want more lights.As I read in one review there are other companies that make different lighting and also you can find underwater lights made by people on ebay that seem very well made as well. And that moonlighting system is very nice if your looking to not put anything in the water other then rocks and fish. :-)And last is the 4 star rating. The wires dont like to do what you want them to. I had to get wire guides and a couple extra deco rocks to get them to stay put. They should have included something in the light kit to assist in the wire managment.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This is a great product; every bird owner should own one. My cockatiel is 19 years old so it took him a long time to warm up to it, in fact, I finally put it where his favorite perch was and forced him to use it.

One thing to note, the perch is longer & larger than you would expect so follow the guidelines on what size to buy and make sure your cage is large enough.",birds,0
"I absolutely adore this toy. The catnip is potent, my cats loved it, and it's just plain adorable. The only problem is that my cat who has claimed it as his is a MAJORLY rough player. Within a few hours of arrival, he had chewed into one of the ends, making it a bit gross with a catnip/cat saliva mix. The toy is still usable for now, but if I let him play with it for too long, he starts gnawing at the end and it will soon break completely open.I recommend this toy if your cat is less of a maniac than mine is!",cats,2
I ordered this for my 4 month old Morkie puppy. She is teething now and I thought it would be perfect for her. The size was good but within 10 minutes of having it she had torn off almost all of the ribbons and it was warm to the touch. I returned it and would not recommend this product for any puppy. It would be better if it stayed cold longer and the ribbons were not on it since they are pretty easy to tear off and chew up as my puppy demonstrated.,dogs,3

Huskies are wonderful dogs, but they run away.These leads offer a good solution where an overhead line is not possible. However, their weak link is the snap. The snaps break; about 5 have for me. They also open relatively easily, freeing the dog. My solution is to double attach, using a carbiner (latching) that I bought from REI.Over time, the steel cable will also kink.",dogs,3

I call Petsafe and they refuse to let me switch the transmitter to a more robust one (they also handle the Sportdog brand). They say it is lightening or power surges or grimlins. I care not. The system is designed to be underground! Lightening hits the ground. The fuse does not blow, they system just stops working! Nice job guys. Way to treat a customer.

"This toy arrived Saturday and is of excellent quality. Our 12 month year old kitten played with it immediately and with all her might. The feather toy at the end of the pole is realistic to a small bird flying, as you wave the wand around. Our kitten has made some record bereaking leaps to catch the toy. This toy tires her out in minutes. After a few minutes of vigorous play, she opened her mouth wide, and her tongue was hanging out of her mouth. She then went to the kitchen to lay on the cool floor, with her limbs spread out. She then went to sleep for about 4 hours. We love playing with our kitten with this toy. You just have to remember to stop play after a few minutes and make sure your pet is not exhausted. I don't think she would know when to stop on her own because she loves the toy so much.",cats,2

If you run out of filters, you can temporarily take the filter in the drinking fountain, rinse it out and reinsert it. It will last long enough for your new filters to arrive. Having a new / clean filters is an absolute necessity for the fountain, not just because it keeps the water clean, but it keeps the pump quiet and a smooth stream pumping out of the fountain.",cats,2

"DID NOT WORK ON MY COCKER SPANIEL AT ALL!!!!!!! However it did work on my Chihuahua, but I got his thing for only my Spaniel (my Chihuahua is trained), so to me, it's useless. It did not even make a single impression on him. And trust me, his ears are fine. I got so frustrated that I even used it 1 inch from his ear, and absolutely nothing happened! He even tried to chew it! Well the box did say that it worked on most dogs, so I can't be too upset. Make sure that if you get this product, that it comes with a good return policy just in case it does not work on your dog.",dogs,3
"When you have a cat, you have lots of options. When you have four cats, you need a box that is easy to clean and maintain because you have more than just one. After trying corner boxes, two electric boxes, and these, my husband and I have gotten rid of all others and kept just these very simple boxes. Roll it over, bang on the bottom, roll back, empty tray. That's it. No plastic bags or trays to replace, no icky scooping to do, no noisy motors getting stuck at 2 a.m., no tines getting soiled because the substance wasn't dry. Easy, effecient, and economical.If you have a big cat (one of mine is almost 17 pounds), get the large.",cats,2
"I picked up a Feliway plug-in for my neurotic cat when a friend and her small dog temporarily moved in. Domino sprays when he is nervous (and sometimes when he isn't) and I fully expected him to hit every rug in the house. I even covered the sofa with plastic and a throw just in case he smelled either the dog or my friend on there and decided to cover their smell with his own. To my surprise, Domino was quite well behaved -- right up to the day the dispenser ran out. Then he sprayed a rug and a tote bag. Needless to say, I ran out and bought the refill.Now this product did not change Domino's personality. He is still skittish to the point of paranoia. But at least he isn't urinating on everything.",cats,2
"Got this for our old Golden Retriever. When I first put it on him and he barked, I could see that it worked- his eyes closed and he shook his head. A minute later he went to bark and he caught himself- I was so happy! Well, about ten minutes later he just barked and barked like it wasn't even on. So, I trimmed his fur all around that area, refilled the can, and ..... Nothing. He just didn't care that the smell came out, I guess, and I think he realized that if he barks a lot for a minute, then it's not a problem anymore.Ok, so I figured it must just work better on smaller dogs, and I can return it. NOPE, can't return it. 'Hazardous materials' can't be returned- they won't even take back the collar, without the extra refill cans of spray I shouldn't have ordered.So there's about $50 down the drain- for nothing. SO disappointed with Amazon, and Innotek company, right now.",dogs,3
"We bought this (the 8-panel size) for our new Havanese puppy. Although I am crate-training her, I wanted her to have a little more room sometimes when I bring her in from outside but still be able to keep an eye on her. Our house is very open in its layout, so baby gates in the kitchen were impossible. I set the pet pen up in the kitchen using 6 of the 8 panels. The puppy has toys and an extra bed in it. She plays and watches me as I prepare meals, and I know she is safe. I've had no problem with her trying to climb up the sides. I agree that it would be nice to have a floor and/or a top to the pen as optional add-ons. I don't need either, but I think options like that would make this an even better item. I haven't tried to use it outside, mainly because the weather has been very hot and humid, but in the fall, I will put it on our deck, patio, or lawn when my husband or I are going to be sitting out there. Great product and well worth the money.",dogs,3

"I foster a 115lb. Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was left to fend for herself for several months and is a food driven scavenger. After a few incidents of opening and raiding my fridge and counter surfing, I resorted to ""feeding her like a bear"" making her work for her food as if she were still ""in the wild"" I have tried several ""treat"" dispensing toys and this is her favorite! I give her a handful of her food in a bowl and the remainder of her daily food is put in one of the two ""orange food balls"". She ALWAYS has a food ball in her mouth and knows where they are. I refill them at least three times a day and she has them in her crate with her all day and never chews on them. This toy is a life-saver as it challenges her to ""work for her food"" and keeps her occupied all day and even during the night. While we still struggle with attempts to ""raid"" the kitchen - if the food ball is filled and available, she is quite content to ""work"" it and leave the fridge, drawers and counters alone. I have recommended it to several friends and their dogs all seem to enjoy it just as much! Thank you, and if you ever decide to make an XL, Lula and I would upgrade!!!!",dogs,3
This is my second training tray. As Lolly grew she needed more bedding space and less training tray. Hence.......the small protection tray instead of the medium tray!

"I am using this collar on a 40-pound Corgi, and it has reduced a tendency to compulsive-excitement barking especially first thing in the morning. The progressive feature sometimes takes several barks to kick in (perhaps because of his rather thick hair) but if he persists in barking it startles him sufficiently that now when I put on the collar he knows not to bark. I have not had to go beyond level 2 on the variable power scale, which is good -- level 2 is plenty.",dogs,3
"Maybe it is just my cats, but for some reason they like to drink from running water instead of just a water dish.

"I discovered these pads a couple of months ago, and it's the end of a years-long absorbency quest (yes, I need to get a life). I have two toy poodles who are primarily paper-trained (actually, indoor-outdoor); they indulge in competitive peeing, so the papers get a real workout. Contrary to another reviewer's experience, I found the Four Paws brand frustratingly under-absorbent; they also had too many defects, with the padding unevenly distributed and occasionally absent in some areas. For a while I thought I'd found a solution with the Advance pads - more expensive but more absorbent - and then the manufacturer ""improved"" them and my floors were soaked. Forget about any of the cheapo brands; they're like using cut-rate paper towels instead of Bounty. Gridlocks are by far the best product out there - much more absorbent than even Advance at its best. Buy them and your puppies will be free to pee without fear of embarrassing run-off!",cats,2

"I'm owned by 4, indoor fur-kids. That's a lot of cat food and an awful lot of cat litter.I'm allergic to the cats (yes I know, but it's worth it), and one of the cats also has allergies. The dust - even from the so called low-dust cat litters was terrible. And forget even the concept of clumping.In complete desperation I tried the World's Best Cat Litter. Now, normally I use about 95% organic stuff here anyway, but was very skeptical about the cat litter.It's wonderful. I mean completely wonderful! No dust, it clumps instantly, no sticking to the bottom of the pan, it lasts, is organic, I flush everything away (no more plastic bags going to the landfill) - and most importantly the fur-kids took to it from the first try.Our multiple litter boxes are all the open type (it's better for multiple cat household because of the constant who's-in-charge games they play), and they get cleaned twice a day; takes about 5 minutes total for all them.How can you beat that?And for anyone that complains about odor - add in a little baking soda and/or clean them a bit more often.We're completely sold on this stuff, and I cannot imagine ever going back and using anything else.",cats,2

I was afraid I would have trouble open and closing it, since when I had my babies I did not use a stroller, so I was not familiar with the way it works, but I find it very easy to open & close. It looks strong enough to last for a long time. We are very happy with it.",cats,2

"I opened the box to several pairs of slightly intrigued eyes. Took out the toy and immediately the balls were rolling and the cats were clamoring all over me to get to it. I didn't even insert the `mouse on a stick' and they were playing with the balls in their tracks.That was yesterday. They are still playing, and with my cat family's size, I need another one of these to relive some of the competition. I just now sent in an order to AMAZON for a 2nd Pestages Cheese Chase.I supposed the enthusiasm will decrease over time, but then I will just put this away for a while and bring it back again as I do with some of their other toys. And I'll insert the 'stick mouse' next time.My cats also have 3 of theseHagen Catit Design Senses Play Circuit, Originalwhich I set up as large S shapes. They play with those regularly and I recommend them highly also.This toy requires no assembly aside from sticking the mouse into a hole on top - again, which I didn't have time to do before the cats wanted to play. I think it is well made for the price and should last. The mouse is a soft fabric toy and it will probably get removed from its stick perch by my cats. And the tracks don't necessarily need that mouse on a stick to be a great toy!",cats,2

"I have been very satisfied with this litter box. It is super easy to clean the litter every day with little or no mess. And the best part, you never touch the litter! It has been great for my young daughter to help take care of the cat. My only comments would be that changing the litter is a little tricky, and can be messy, only because of the unique shape of the bottom piece, but once you get the hang of it, it is not a problem. Since there is no liner for this type of litter box (nor can there be), the bottom piece has to be cleaned with every litter change. But that is less often, since you remove the waste every day, keeping the litter fresh. I think this litter box works best with the super-clumping litter. I kind of wish it came in other colors.",cats,2

"I was desperate to find a way to keep my cats from shredding the new chairs. I ordered this product and it saved my sanity and my kitties digits! they were used to being clipped, so they sat fairly patiently while I glued the tips on. I pre-filled them with glue (according to directions)and just popped them on one at a time. I was really surprised at how quickly my kitties ""forgot"" about them. There are so many tips in the package and you only need to do the front paws, so if you lose one or two in the first few days it is no problem. They seem to lose about one a week with natural shedding, but I just replace it in a second. They are inexpensive and fun looking! Interesting outcome is that since they can't ""get a grip"" on my chairs they have completely lost interest in them. They do get a nice grip on the scratching posts (and the carpet, harmlessly) so they get their scratching ""fix."" THE alternative to declawing!",cats,2

"I bought this because our adopted pitbull mix has anxiety issues generally, but specifically with loud noises. Motorcycles, fireworks, thunder and the like all cause her to rouse from a restful state into a hair-standing, tail-flagged, barking nightmare. When in this state, even her favorite treats are ignored, and the only thing that will (seem) to calm her down is to put her in her kennel. Now, with the anxiety wrap, she will sleep soundly through all of those noisy things I mentioned. It's really amazing. I haven't had any luck using it to calm her during walks, I think squirrels and other dogs cause much more acute anxiety in her, and the wrap doesn't seem to help with that. One note, she absolutely hates the leg straps, so I don't put them on and it doesn't seem to decrease the wrap's effectiveness.",dogs,3
"This automatic litter bowl is nice it verrry slowly does one full rotation an hour and my cats never seem to notice. I have a big girl who's afraid of most things (ceiling fan, outstretched arms) and she doesn't seem to mind it. I do believe she has never even noticed it moves. I love that I just put a plain old plastic grocery bag in the receptacle and change that out a couple of times a week and my girls are happy campers. I have recommended this to many people even with some of the issues described below. We even did the math and it's more cost effective to buy a new one of these bad boys every year (though customer service is so great I haven't had too) than to buy the other brands of auto litter boxes that require special trays or receptacles.However it does leave a bit of 'poo-fetti' the little pieces that aren't big enough to be caught up onto the litter 'arm', this doesn't bother me, but it seems to bother some reviewers, I just scoop those out once a week when I check the litter level.You do need to use good quality clumping litter, I love Fresh Step Multiple Cats the best, otherwise the clumping is poor quality and the dust gets into the gears causing some horrid noises this it easy to clean out. And occasionally when the receptacle is freshly emptied and there is a bigger present falling in a new person visiting may be scared by the loud thunk, I just tell them it's a kitty deposit in the kitty bank.And of course on the negative side I do have to admit the first litter box they sent to me had horrid loud noises almost right out of the box that no amount of litter changing or gear cleaning could fix. They sent me a new one free of charge right after I called them and gave them proof of purchase this is a big thing with the company KEEP your receipt always with this item! New one was fine (silent) but eight months later the bowl won't rotate anymore (therefore no auto litter scooping- gasp!) and the company is sending me a new gear motor to try and fix the issue. Apparently the gear underneath that rotates the bowl portion gets worn out with little granules of litter that get swooped around (especially with enthusiastic diggers like I have). My thought is if they could somehow add a lid for the bowl then it might really help shy cats and general kitty privacy and help with the flying litter that per the company eventually kills the gear motor. I want this product to keep working it's a good idea and it seems to be a smooth transition for kitties and is better than buying special receptacles as with other auto litter boxes plus I don't have to mine for kitty presents all the time. I really want this motor to fix the problem I have come to depend on this machine.NEW UPDATE 10/2011After the new motor replacement the bowl regained movement and all was fine. Until last month now the bowl will only rotate for about ten minutes tops and then it stops. I have taken it all apart and cleaned it out multiple times which used to fix things if they got resistant or noisy but not this time. I placed a call with customer service for a new motor or gear or both and the representative said they would send me a new unit once I emailed them a copy of my receipt (thank god for PDF's!) so I am waiting to make the big exchange. It was very nice of the company to replace my kitty box, but damn I wish it wouldn't break as often as it does, I love this contraption.",cats,2

"I chose this product because of the rave reviews here on Amazon. My dog is a 7 year old Pomeranian with the worst breath I've ever smelled. I've tried all the toothpastes at the pet store except enzymatic ones. This is the first enzymatic toothpaste I've tried, but after 2 days of using it, his breath cleared up completely. Its a pleasure to be near him when he yawns now. I don't see any reversal in tartar buildup, but nothing can get rid of that aside from a real dental cleaning (I would know since I'm a dentist). However, the toothpaste does a good job in minimizing future buildup.The hugest difference to me is the complete change in his breath. I give it 5 stars for that since nothing has solved that problem for us in 7 years.",dogs,3

"Have had this toy two days and already my two tuxedo cats are going crazy over it. I love how much it bends and doesn't break. They love how it swivels and it makes noise when you go moderately fast that sounds like birds flapping wings. It really is the best cat toy I have purchased. I didn't immediately wrap it in electrical tape which was a big mistake because it wasn't before long that I got a teeny tiny splinter so I immediately wrapped it in tape. So far so good! Even with the splinter, I rate this a great 5 star toy that every cat owner should purchase!",cats,2
"I just purchased this dog bed on eBay. I'm always skeptical because my 4 dogs are extremely destructive and don't take to new things very well. I can honestly say this is the best purchase I have made for my dogs in years. The construction is sturdy and all you need to put it together is a screw driver. It's so easy to assemble, it takes about 3 minutes.As soon as I put the Coolaroo bed outside on my porch, they were ALL over it. They absolutely love it. I actually bought another just a few minutes ago so that they would all be able to enjoy it, one isn't enough for 4 dogs. It's definitely a good size for one large dog and I believe it will truly support 150 lbs as the company claims.I think this dog bed is a must for people who love their dogs. It keeps them off the ground, away from bugs, dirt, etc. I also think older pets will truly benefit from this bed. I would imagine laying on the hard ground would be painful for dogs and other animals with arthritis and joint pain. This will help alleviate their pain by keeping them from laying on the ground and putting pressure on those painful spots. Also, this dog bed is definitely a plus for hot weather, keeping them cool. It's a mesh material so air flows freely under the bed and cools from the bottom as well. Both summer and winter are times to keep the pets off the ground and comfy.If your dog is resistant to this bed at first, try to coax them on it and reward them with praise and a treat. They will know it's a good thing if you spend a little time with them. Eventually, they will adore this bed like my 4 dogs do and you'll wonder why you didn't buy one sooner.",cats,2

"First, a couple of notes regarding the accuracy of this product's listing. It boasts ""assembles in minutes"" and ""Titan Strength, Stability and Construction."" The latter claim isn't exactly inaccurate... I don't worry that my cats will knock this thing over. That said, ""titan"" is overstating the case. The last piece of cat furniture we owned was sturdier and more stable than this one. As for the former claim, well...The huge piece of cat furniture arrives in a surprisingly small box, thanks to the fact that it's disassembled into as many component pieces as one could possibly manage, pretty much. The ""step by step assembly instructions"" consist of a single sheet diagram of the multitude of parts and screws, numbered but with no written instructions whatsoever. Parts of it seem ambiguous and difficult to interpret, and there are no numbers on the pieces, so you spend a while trying to match everything up exactly. It took more than an hour and a half to assemble the thing, despite the fact that we've assembled what should have been far more complicated pieces of furniture with far less trouble. Parts of it ended up being disassembled and then reassembled multiple times because it was so easy to misinterpret the ""directions."" All of this could have been avoided by including an accurate photo of the finished product and a sheet of step-by-step written instructions, in which case I expect this wouldn't have taken all that long to assemble--maybe 20 minutes?Also, the dangling rope toy included is about half the length of the one in the photo. However, they did include a fuzzy mouse on an elastic string hanging from the second-highest perch that also isn't in the photo, and this is our cats' favorite part of the whole contraption.Our cats love the height of this thing so much that so far they've largely ignored the lowest two levels. Unfortunately the only real way through the front door of the ""house"" on the third level is via a small step that isn't well-placed, so they're a little reluctant to use it. However, while many cats would be too large to use the diamond cutout in the side of the house as a door, luckily ours aren't. If you have generously proportioned cats then I wouldn't recommend buying this model.Ultimately, if I had this to do over again I'd buy a piece from a different company or pick it up from a store pre-assembled or assembled in several major pieces. The company could do so much to raise customer satisfaction simply by producing a good set of instructions, which really wouldn't take much time and effort given how much it would improve things, so I have no idea why they don't do it. As our friend who helped out commented, ""If I'd bought this I would have it packed back up in the box and waiting to be shipped back by now."" However, I can marginally recommend the piece just because once it's assembled it really does entertain the cats--particularly if your cats love heights!",cats,2
"Love the Furminator! My dog (a Shiloh Shepherd) has a long coat and gets a thick undercoat that is hard to brush out with conventional brushes; the Furminator works like magic. She will lay there for two hours and just let me brush it all out (she's a big girl). My parents ended up getting one for their dogs too, and they love it!

"Our female dogs suffer from separation anxiety when we try to leave them to go out to dinner when traveling. Because of the barking and whining that they could possibly make and fear of pissing off the tenants in the ajoining rooms we end up just eating in our room to keep them calm. They howl or bark like crazy. To aleviate the problem my husband stays with them and I go down to the restaurant to pick up the food and we just eat in our hotel room. With this product we were able to give it to them within 1 hour to going out and they remained calm and quiet. We left the hotel room and the girls just sat their on the bed.

We left his old litterbox out for a while and just didn't clean it, and then took it away after 2-3 days and he has been fine. He loves to watch the cleaning cycle. I would definitely recommend this product.",cats,2
"We live in the mountains and our dogs get lots of ticks. I HATE ticks. They are gross, creepy, disease carrying parasites that would love to infest your home ... first your dogs, then your kids, then you. Here is how they operate (briefly) ... first a female tick bites your dog and begins to engorge ... then she puts out a pheromone that attracts male ticks. Interesting note here",dogs,3
After searching the internet for weeks I just got lucky when I happened upon this item while purchasing another item on Amazon.com. I needed a suitable outdoor gate/fence to keep my little Orielle confined on the front porch when I am busy inside. Ori is a Miniature Australian Shepherd so the height of these panels is tall enough that she can't jump over and low enough that I can get myself over without too much effort. It was easy to assemble and can be used as either a pen or stretched out as a gate. It's lightweight making it easy to move around when necessary. It's durable and easy to keep clean - I just hose it off from time to time. And it's quite attractive - doesn't make the front of my house look like a fortress. It's plastic so I don't have to bring it in when it rains. Many people walking past my house have commented on the fence and some of them have bought one as well.,dogs,3

"I have cats who love to scratch and despite many scratching posts, they preferred scratching the corners of our leather couch, at least until I bought a couple of the Ultimate Scratching Posts. I put one by each of the back corners of the couch and the cats totally ignore the couch now, preferring the scratching posts. The Ultimate does not shed, it doesn't get ugly bare spots like the carpeted ones, and it doesn't get knocked down, ever, even with a cat putting all its weight against it!I used to have piles of ripped carpet and shredded rope scattered all around the bottom of the old style scratching posts, but the floor around the Ultimate Scratching Posts is perfectly clean; it's a joy!This scratching post is very good looking and sturdy and a perfect solution to my scratching problems. I highly recommend it.September 2009 Update - These posts still look as good as the day they arrived and continue to be very popular. The cats are not interested in scratching anywhere else.December 2011 Update - It's been almost three years since I purchased the first of several of these scratching posts. The most popular one is now ripped to shreds and torn at the corners. When I stuck my finger through to the post core I discovered that the fabric is so much thicker than I would have imagined. The other ultimate scratching posts are doing great although one of them looks a little wrinkled and saggy like it wasn't properly adhered to the post from the start, but it is still doing its job. I am hoping to reupholster the badly torn one with some sisal fabric remnants that I obtained online and that should make it good as new. These posts outlast the rug types that can look ratty in just a few short weeks. Considering my cats love these ultimate posts and use them often, I am a very happy and satisfied customer.",cats,2

The boots also wash/dry (low dry) well in my machines, just follow package instructions. I would put them in a zippered pillow cover, and wash with other stuff that's not delicate (obviously?!)

"We have 2 cats that dig to china in a litter box & make an incredible mess. We tried this hoping it would alleviate the problem but it is so flimsy and the dome fits so poorly on the base that the cats kept knocking the top off & created a bigger problem. This resulted in litter scattered not only on the steps going into the dome, but all around the dome after they knocked the lid off. In particular, we were trying to have less litter dragged into the rest of the house (the litter is in the laundry room); unless I used the shop vac to remove the litter from the steps every day, the cats were actually dragging MORE litter throughout the house. Especially after the amount we had spent on this pan, we were very disappointed. The other problem with this design is that the actual litter area is quite small, which contributed to our one large cat (15+ pounds) knocking the dome off. We will be donating it to a rescue group in the hope that someone can use it. We are quite pleased with our solution",cats,2
"There are reviews about this being loud. Give it a little time before making a decision to return it. First off, I previously had an Aqueon filter on 29 gallon tank. This Emperor 280 is almost twice as big as that Aqueon. It pumps a lot more water also. So, naturally it is a little louder but not much. For the first couple of days it was noticeably louder but now (2 weeks later) you can barely hear it. I do believe it was just too clean at first and needs a little break-in time. The Aueon was quieter but it also is smaller and it was also for the same size tank. You can use this Emperor for up to 50 gallons. So if you plan on upgrading later on, you may as well get it now and it will be established already for when you do upgrade down the road. Personally, I am going to use two of these for a 55 gallon tank whenever I happen to upgrade.It has a huge amount of space for bacteria to grow. I filled the empty media cartridge up with AquaClear BioMax Filter Media. This along with the bio wheel will allow a lot more bacteria growth compared to many other filters.It creates a lot of top water disturbance as the water flows back into the tank, which is very good.If I have any problems or further info I will update this review.UPDATE:I ordered this on November 4th, 2012. So I installed it a few days later. It is now November 25th. I don't hear this thing running at all unless you put your head right up to it. At first it did have a little noise like a mechanical sound, but I believe it just needed to break-in. It is actually very quiet. Unless your water level is low in the tank, you won't really hear anything.",fish aquatic pets,4

"We bought these life vests for our two boxers so they could come deep water padding with us. The vests will be used only if one of the dogs goes overboard, not as swimming support. We had the dogs practice swimming with them (makes sense to get them used to the preservers first,) and are confident if we capsize these preservers will support the boxer-dogs on longer swims. That doesn't happen very often.If the dogs were doing a lot of swimming, stick fetching, and boxing these vests might not hold up too well. But they're perfect for what Olive and Barndog need.USE THE SIZING CHART! MEASURE the neck, chest, and length. Don't guess. A little too big is better than a little too small. Our dogs are 67 and 85 pounds. I assumed the smaller dog would take size L, the bigger dog an XL. I'm so glad I measured them. Both dogs fit nicely into XLs. The sizing for our dogs has a lot to do with chest size.So far, we're pleased!",dogs,3

I tried Critter Ridder but it is most effective on smaller animals and works for less than 30 days.When I was shopping at Fred Meyer, I found Cat Stop. At first I was skeptical. So, I forked out the $65. What is really sad is that you get one for that price. (Also the store charges too much money as it is.)After putting in the battery the Cat Stop was already in action. My dog looked at me more curious. I put it in my garden. It sure deterred the dog. It seems to be working well.

"I almost didn't buy this due to the negative reviews I found. So glad I did, though! We recently added a new member to our family and he's quite a messy boy. He loves to drop his food in the water and stick his paws in the bowl just for fun. Drinkwell solved our problem! Now both my boys have clean water at all times even when I'm not home to clean their water dish.The first thing I noticed after plugging in the fountain was the low hum that came from the motor. We heard this for about a week straight and didn't find it a bit annoying. In fact, it is an extremely soft humming sound and to hear it you had to be standing next to the fountain. We solved this ""problem"" by putting a rubber mat under it. Now, it's absolutely silent and the only thing you hear is the soft sound of falling water which I find very relaxing. Occasionally the fountain does make a gurgling noise which may scare some pets, but my Chihuahuas don't seem to mind it... and that says a lot for two boys who are afraid of their own shadow. (Chihuahuas... Tsk tsk)As for cleaning, I don't find it's too much of a hassle and usually spend about 15 minutes a week doing so. I use a dishsoap and vinegar solution which works wonders. Vinegar is great for getting rid of slime build-up. If you make sure to clean it at least once a week, there shouldn't be too much build-up anyway. Also be sure to routinely clean the pump, which is pretty easy as well. Initially, I was going to purchase the cleaning kit along with the fountain but I'm glad I chose to hold off on the cleaning kit. I don't think I'll be needing it as long as I use hot, soapy water and the cleaning solution mentioned above.I find the water capacity to be enough and whenever we go to clean our Drinkwell (weekly), there is still plenty of water to last them for 3 to 4 days minimum. So if I for some reason went without cleaning their fountain, they would have water to last them a good 10 days.I am extremely happy with our purchase and can't imagine going back to our old Petmate Microban waterer which got a million times slimier with weekly cleaning. Hooray for Drinkwell! :)",cats,2

It is very thick and soft and comfortable, and I was excited for my dog to have such a nice bed. But after two washings, the zipper came off the cover! Try as I might, there's no fixing it (unless I want to fork out to take it to a zipper repair shop). Also, you can't imagine how difficult it is to put the cover back onto the foam cushion after removing it. It takes two people a world of effort to get it back on (the cover really grips hard to the foam, so it's really hard to move them past one another). I had chosen this bed because I wanted to be able to wash the cover every couple weeks, to keep my dog's bed clean, but it's just too exhausting to deal with. I really wish I hadn't spent all the money to buy this bed, because now I'm going to have to buy a different one.",dogs,3

"Despite reading all of the bad reviews my husband and I decided to give the LitterMaid Elite a chance. We are a two cat household and I thought it would be so nice to have a little litter box duty relief. And it would have been, had the littermaid actually worked at all.Just like the reviews above stated the rake simply is non functional. The very first time our cat pooped in it the rake was unable to push it up into the waste receptacle. We tried everything. We put less litter in, then we tried filling the litter box up more (which did improve the success rate to about 50% mind you). Also, we noticed our sensors were not detecting the cats every time they went in it. So half the time the thing didn't even attempt to scoop it.This product really is a piece of overpriced trash. They obviously did not do any sort of consumer testing before putting the new ""elite"" model on the market.

I was very disappointed with this product after using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts and really liking the Everlasting Ball.The initial problem was screwing the two ends onto the rod. I'm not sure if there is some special trick to this or what because I spent a longer time trying to figure out how to screw it all together than it took for my dog to chew through it. The pieces don't seem to fit well together and the first time I tried to muscle the whole thing in place the end pieces cracked.One of my dogs who is admittedly a strong chewer was able to get through the ends and rod in under 15 minutes. She can pretty easily bite the rod down to the end cap and has figured out that if she licks the ends enough the two end pieces will easily pop out because they don't fit in as snuggly as the everlasting treat ends do for some reason.I would recommend skipping this and just using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts if your dog is not a really aggressive chewer.,dogs,3

"We have a young cat(18mos) that has flawlessly used the litterbox from a kitten. Following product instructions we were successful in the first two phases of training. When we removed the second ring, our cat began to look for other places to eliminate, with the result that we now have three separate places in our house with stains on wool carpet.The odor is finally fading(to us) but in spite of repeated enzyme & steam treatments & reversion to the traditional litterbox, our cat continues to regard these areas as places to 'go'. We have had to barricade these zones in the house, and that's a pretty awful way to live. If you choose to try this product, be sure to scoop within minutes of you cat's use, keep as much litter in the device as possible, and take the unit off the toilet AT LEAST every other day and clean and dry it. Molds and foul odors develop on the underside facing the commode water, and your cat will smell this before you do and refuse to use the CitiKitty. Good luck with it!",cats,2
"I order this thinking I would get a small bunny, I ended up getting a large one. The cage ended up being to small, my fault for ordering it without thinking. It was easy to set up, and I liked the idea of the wheels so that It could be easly moved around for cleaning. I wasnt thrilled about the slide under drip pan. I was told by the person selling me my rabbits that rabbits need to eat the fesies to help digestion. This cage was not good for that. But all and all a good cage.",bunny rabbit central,1
I have three cats and two out of the three of them loved them. My one cat is lazy and would rather watch than have to chase something in defense of the two out of three number. My other two love chasing them through the house and it keeps them out of trouble for at least a little bit. I would purchase again.,cats,2
"We had to get this toothbrush kit for our cat who has a bad gene pool regarding his teeth. It works just great and the cat doesn't really seem to mind having his teeth brushed at all. After paying $300 to have them cleaned, this is definitely a good investment. If your cat has bad teeth, or even if he doesn't, this is just a good habit to start in your cat's hygiene. It definitely saves on the health bills later!",cats,2
"The Van Ness enclosed cat pan is a cheap solution to your litter problems, but falls short in the end. The front door of our litter box broke after about two months of use. Also, the unit fails to retain nasty smells. Have a large cat? Then this litter box is certainly not for you.",cats,2
"I bought this to breed some shrimp I had purchased and did not want a Hang On Back filter as that would suck up the fry (shrimp babies). I do like this product, I attached mine to an airstone and it is still kicking months later. I thought that $15 was a bit much for this thing but it was still cheaper than in a store and it seemed like the ideal product at the time. It does not mix up the water in the way that other traditional filters do, so if thats what you need this for do not get it. However, if what you want is a light filter for cleaning a small tank, this is the product you want.",fish aquatic pets,4
My neighbor recommended this to me for my dog's hot spots/ butt sores and even said she uses it on her dog's paws for bee stings. I got some and my dog's butt issue went away instantly. Good product and saved me a trip to the vet.,dogs,3

"I originally found this rope years ago at a Petsmart, and decided to give it a try due to the dental benefits it lists. It quickly became my dog's favorite chew toy, and the durability of this rope is above all others I have tried. Any other rope toys I have bought for her have been torn to shreds within 2-3 days, but this rope tends to last at least a couple weeks, if not longer. When she does manage to shred it, it does leave a lot of little strings all over the house, but what rope won't?The price on Amazon simply can't be beat, easily beating the pet store's prices by five dollars or more, which is great since my dog loves to go through these ropes as quickly as possible. It also keeps her teeth nice and clean, so it's a winner in my book.",dogs,3
"This product was recommended by my vet for my mature dog, which needed to drop a few pounds. She told me to give it to her, instead of table scraps. It works like a charm. She loves the taste, and leaves me alone while I am eating. I highly recommend it.",dogs,3
"When I bought this, I believe Amazon had surplus of discontinued products, so I got it for around $36 including shipping/handling. Hence my comment ""Economical"". Normally doggy door like this (size/material) costs you near $100.This product works really well with my dogs (boxer and mutt), but the petsafe logo on the flap deposits dirt since the dogs go through it all the time.In addition, I haven't been able to find replacement flap in case this one goes bad. Replacing the flap would also involve uninstalling the door, which is a bit of a hassle.Overall the aluminum frame looks good and strong, but the cover is plastic which was disappointing. The frame itself is actually pretty strong and especially would work well once installed and fit into a door, but the screws are also plastic, so I had to buy metal screws myself.",dogs,3

This product is great I have 5 maltese. 3 are 4 month old and everyone of them tolerates this product. I guess Im lucky that they do. But the maltese show dogs are very white. I really can tell the change. I actually ran out and they hadnt had it for a week. And the tear stains came back. Wont let that happen again. I am not one to write review's, but this one I had to do. For over a year I was asking if there was something out there, THIS IS IT. Dont understand why the Big Pet stores dont stock this stuff.",dogs,3
"My two dogs and I love this water bowl. It stays full all day while I'm at work, the shine makes it easy for me to tell when water needs to be changed, and the weight of the water makes the bowl stay in place.I might look into this for food bowls for each dog, but a smaller version.",cats,2

"After researching and reading many reviews on various sites (and having used other comparable products - mainly Littermaids), I am am not only thrilled with this litterbox, but so are my cats. The unit is a breeze to clean between changes, is much quieter, and so much easier to handle while cleaning and changing cartridges (Littermaid litterally was a chore!). The most fascinating thing about this box is how my much cats love it. With other units, once I cleaned the unit and changed the litter, the cats would come running which would last an hour of so. Now I have one cat that actually sleeps next to the box in the bathroom, she loves it so much.I agree with other reviewers that the additional price is a bit hard to swallow, but the low tracking litter and ease of cleaning both the box itself and the surrounding areas really makes up for it. I agree that stirring the litter 1-2 times a day extends the life of the cartridge and so far each one has lasted 12-14 days with 2 young healthy cats. I have yet to try the ""Forever Cartridge"" found on eBay, but may give it a shot sometime soon to see if I can reduce my overall costs. (I did contact Scoop Free and they have no interst in creating such an item at this time.)Overall opinion... buy it, you won't be disappointed.",cats,2
"I've been using this product (all tests except ammonia) for about 6 months for weekly testing in a koi pond. Tests appear accurate and easy to use with good directions for the ""trickier"" multi-reagent tests. I'm very happy with the kit and will be buying another for work.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Our 4 month malamute puppy enjoys this toy, and loves looking for treats we hide inside. He doesn't actually chew on it much, but I'm assuming he will more when he's older. For now he just prefers his soft plush toys and bully sticks. This Kong is great for putting peanut butter inside also, and it's easy to clean. I've found it's dishwasher safe as long as it's not heat or steam dried. All in all it's a great toy and seems so stand up to all the playing and chewing that will certainly happen eventually. I recommend buying this product if you have a chewer or a dog that likes to entertain himself by trying to get treats out of things!",dogs,3

My 9 month old labrador loved this toy but in only a couple of hours itcame apart and she tore an eye off. I might be able to re-sew it but I wouldn't recommend it for a dog that likes to chew things. I have a Dr. Noy soft toy that has held up much better.,dogs,3
This is by far the best leash I have ever owned. It's the first retractable leash I have used. I don't think I will ever go back to a regular leash. It's very easy to use and my dog loves it too.

"I bought one of these a few months ago with the hope that my two cats would stop flinging litter all over the kitchen. One of them has a tendency to leap out of the box when he's finished his business, while the other digs as if she's on her way to China. We had a normal square covered box at first, but I figured this would solve the problem.It did, for a while.Like the other reviewers, however, I do notice that the box needs another wall at the entrance. The box itself is also far too small for two cats and needs to be scooped on a daily basis; even with the odor control panel, it stinks up my apartment (sometimes even when it's scooped daily!). The top of the box does not latch on to the bottom, meaning that with enthusiastic diggers, it gets nudged off the bottom...leading to cat waste outside the box thanks to them backing up against the walls. Even with the litter liners, this thing is a pain.I'm on my way to get a new box today to replace this one. It's a shame, I had such hope for it!",cats,2
I got this for my rat terrier for halloween since my in-laws are crawfish farmers. It was a hit. He looked sooo cute! Awesome quality and great product.,dogs,3
"These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly ""indestructible"" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs. Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily! Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-) In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed",dogs,3

"I purchased the large home for my hedgehog. While I would have preferred to purchase the extra large home for him, I simply do not have the room at this moment and this cage still met the minimum size requirements. I do however plan on up grading him in the future when possible.For my use, I feel like this was a good purchase. The Amazon price was perfect. Overall, the cage has been easy to clean and although I haven't used it too long, I feel durability wise, it will hold up just fine. However, the clips on each side which are suppose to hold the wire top to the plastic base are way too short. They don't even come close to clipping under the little piece they are suppose to. And yes, I did move them down a rung and then they are too long. This is a little frustrating and requires me to use bungee cords in order to safely secure the cage. I do plan on contacting the company to see what they can do for me.On another note, please think twice about purchasing this item for a ""larger"" small pet such as a guinea pig, rabbit, chinchilla, or ferret. The large size cage is much too small for any of these critters. Even the extra large cage would be pushing it, unless they got a few hours of playtime outside of the cage each day. My little hedgehog gets at least an hour or two of supervised play in a very large playpen every day. I find it very unfortunate that this company would even suggest that the large home would be an acceptable size for one of these pets (which was extremely obvious they did judging by the box it arrived in). I'm not one of those crazy animal activists, but I would feel it's boarder line animal cruelty to keep such a large animal in such a small cage. Please do your research on an appropriate size cage before you bring your new friend home.",small animals,5

"I have been looking for a crate pad that was the right dimensions for my GSD's 43"" x 28.5"" x 31.5"" Midwest crate and it always seemed like the dimensions weren't right. I thought I would give this one a try because the dimensions were close and I'm super happy I did. It fits perfectly in the crate!!! Not only that, my dog loves the little ring of pillow around the edge because he likes to rest his chin on top of something. I think the pillow around the edge also gives him something to lean against so he's not leaning against the side of the crate. I catch him going in to his crate and laying down more than before when he just had a flat pad. I realize it sounds like I'm making all sorts of humanizing interpretations, but I really do think my dog really likes it and more than his old crate pad because he used to chew up his flat crate pad but he hasn't even nibbled on this one!My only complaint (not even really a complaint) is that I wish the center was a bit more padded. I'm not too worried about it though. It's going to be interesting to see what happens to it after I put it in the washer and dryer for the first time. If there aren't any problems cleaning it, I will definitely order another one so that I have an extra one to put into rotation so he will always have one while I wash the other.",dogs,3

Our cat loves his new 'friend' but I doubt the feeling is mutual. Poor Mr. Squirrel has been getting severely pummeled and bitten since being introduced to our tabby. I tied some cotton drawstring (ripped from some old pajama pants) to the tail of Mr. Squirrel and our cat has been having a blast. There's a small cavity inside of the toy which you open to place catnip in. The toy shipped with a small tube of loose catnip which you can pour into the cavity and you can freeze the rest for later. Mr. Squirrel has been enduring the continued abuse and it seems like he's pretty well-made so here's hoping he doesn't lose too many hairs or limbs in the future.,cats,2

I have a German Sheperd with Schutzund blood lines that is very hyper. I was concerned if the wireless fence would keep him contained. A friend of mine had one and highly recommended it. I have been very pleased with the wireless fence. I followed the recommendations in the manual and after about three days my dog would not cross the boundary's. I do highly recommend that when taking the dog for walks outside the boundary that you exit the boundary and enter the boundarys with the dog on lead. This lets the dog know that he is not to cross the boundary except when being escorted with his human partner. So much better than a regular fence that you have to weed-eat around or if a buried wired that is alot of trouble to install. This item is worth every cent.,dogs,3

My 2 year old Boxer noses his Tricky Treat Ball all over the house. He isn't the brightest bulb but immediately understood how to work the ball to make treats come out after being shown how the first time.

This is especially great for days when he is being a pain in the butt and I need to keep him busy for a while to give myself a moment of peace and quiet or when it is too cold or rainy for him to get enough outdoor play. He is also a food gulper so this forces him to only eat a few bits of kibble at a time. We have owned this toy a few months now and it is still in great condition. The last piece or two are too hard to get out even I can't get them out and washing fills it with water that won't come out.,dogs,3

Since we have been using thw antser, we have had NO ants in the cat dishes (it's been well over a year).

They're freeze dried so they can pull moisture out of the air and can start to spoil and go rancid.",dogs,3

I really like the product. I researched many of the expensive self cleaning litter boxes. Many had bad reviews. This litter box had good reviews and no moving parts. It was also a lot cheaper than the others. We got a kitten and I was afraid it would be too big for him to get in and out of but it isn't. I tend to clean the litter box more often than i did with my previous litter box because it is easier. Very happy with the product for the price. Would have given it 5 stars but the clips are a little hard to open and close when you need to (though I don't need to do it unless I am adding litter).,cats,2

Assembly was simple inasmuch as there isn't any assembly - just unfolding. I got what I wanted and what I paid for.",dogs,3
We purchased two of these for our two different brands of dog crates and it fit both of them extremely well.

"I have 3 cats, all of which have long hair. Over the years, I've bought several different types of brushes. Without fail, the cats hated them and would run away from me when they spied the brush.I decided to buy the Zoom Groom after reading about it on a forum. Wow, what a change! Instead of running away, my cats now love to be brushed, and purr loudly in the process. I was brushing one of the cats last night, and the other two were sitting at my feet, waiting for their turn. My guess is that the rubber ""bristles"" must feel a lot better than the metal ones on their previous brushes.This brings out quite a bit of dead fur, and most of it sticks to the brush because of static electricity. Every minute or two, I take my opposite hand and pull the excess fur out of the brush. I do have another brush which brings out more dead fur than this, but the cats absolutely hate it.

"We have a 60 lb. Hound/German Shepard puppy who fits very nicely in this bed, there's even room for him to keep his toys in it with him. The size and weight make it easy to deter the pupster from chewing it up too easily (which had been the case with his last three beds). This is a good dog bed, if he should ever grow out of this one in the future I'd probably order a darker color to replace it.",dogs,3

"My vet told me I should switch my cat to some vet prescribed cat food because he had a UTI. I started looking at other options and found this cat food. Since it has cranberries in it, it's good for his urinary tract and I love all the other natural ingredients in the food as well.When I tried feeding him the vet food (which was twice the cost of Holistic Select) he nibbled and picked at it, but when I switched him to this, he had no issues at all. My cat loves this food.",cats,2

"I absolutely love this product!!!! I bought two; I can separate my two small dogs when eating and put them together in a rather large pen in any shape I want. It is also amazing for protecting the walls in my house.

They have so much more room to move around and the accessories keep them entertained and happy. It was really easy to put together and is very sturdy. Plus, I no longer have to vacuum the floor under the cage daily - this cage keeps all seed bits in. I am really, really happy with this purchase. More than worth the money!",birds,0
"I got this item for a pet-loving friend. When it came in the package, it was nice. It looked like it was able to hold a lot of doggy clothes or doggy toys. The only problem is that the lid didn't look like it was closed. The lid easily slips off with a gentle push. -A gentle breeze, even-. Despite the lid, the product itself is very nice. Gives a lot of storage space while being in a cute canine motif. Be careful not to put anything heavy on the box because the thin plastic might crack. Overall, it's a very nice product.",dogs,3
I purchased two of these gates. One to block the little dogs in the kitchen when I work during the day and the other to block the two larger dogs down the hallway area. It also helps when trying to clean since I have everyone of the dogs always at my feet. I can block them in certain areas so I can clean 'by myself' without constant interruption. Since my two larger dogs get very excited when company comes I can block them all down the hallway and leave the small door open so the two little dogs can come out until the larger dogs calm down. Easy to put up. Doors open only in one direction so check where you prefer the direction of the door prior to placing where it won't be in the way. The gates come with two different size extensions included. I used the smaller extension for the kitchen doorway and the longer extension for the gate in the hallway. Works great. Very happy with the purchse and the price.,dogs,3

"These were cheaper pads, and that being said, you get what you pay for. They come folded up in a quarter of their actual size. On half of them when I went to unfold (no matter how gently and slow I did it) the plastic backing ripped. This, of course, defeated the purpose of the pad because my dog's urine ended up getting on the floor. The ones that actually didn't rip when I unfolded them worked fine. They're pretty absorbent and they are pretty much odor free like the packaging suggests. That said, I won't be buying these again as I don't like the fact that half of them ripped.",dogs,3

"New version has been released or at least newer than what I originally purchased. I originally purchased from Petsmart and immediately had noise issues. Contacted petsafe and they replaced the entire unit since they were unable to pinpoint exactly what was causing the excessive noise. When I received the replacement unit from Petsafe I immediately noticed some changes in design. There has been a slight modification to the conveyor system, but most importantly they have added small wheels that the litter bowl rides on so the bottom of the bowl doesn't come in contact with the base of the unit. I would give five stars except I feel the sides need to be higher to help eliminate some of the excessive litter my cats throws from the box.",cats,2
"I purchased this collar with recommendation from my trainer. My dog is passive aggressive and I have to be able to control his face when in public.I could never truly desensitize him to the gentle leader - He was CONSTANTLY rubbing his face against my legs or would lay on the ground and paw at his face, no matter how much work we put into getting him used to it. It got to the point where, during one trip to petsmart, he managed to scrape both of the corners of his eyes raw on my jeans. BE CAREFUL. I would never ever leave this device on any dog without supervision.Now. I don't feel this device is BAD. Dakota is a very unsocial dog, but very intelligent and trains well. I noticed that during the training sessions with the gentle leader, he was far more focused and seemed less distracted by the other dogs/people around. I don't know if it had to do with a 'defeated' attitude, or if he really was paying more attention to get the gentle leader off sooner, but that's how he acted.With this in mind - He can never wear his gentle leader and actually be comfortable. I use it strictly as a control device now (going around crowds, petstores, etc). He would never act like his happy hyper self with it on, so going on walks and playing at the park are reserved for his regular collar.In conclusion, I feel the gentle leader is good for some, not good for others. It really depends on the dog.",dogs,3
"I bought these dog boots for rainy days, when my big boy dog typically runs through mud in the yard. I got tired of constantly wiping up brown paw prints in the kitchen, so I thought this might be a solution. Put them on before going out, off coming in. Voila! Well sorta. The elastic around the top is quite loose. There is a narrow band which cinches and velcros as well. But make no mistake, you have to cinch it down VERY tight or these things will come flying off. I was worried at first that it might be uncomfortable for my dog, but he seems ok with it. Overall, the construction is not that impressive, but it's adequate for the minimal amount of time that my dog wears them. I think if I was taking him on a serious trek...these would probably fall apart. I expected that my dog would hate them, and he does. Walking was a major challenge at first. But it was great for laughs and I nearly peed my pants as he ""swam"" towards the door the first time. After a few tries, he got used to it. And since we only use them on the most wet and muddy days, I think he'll be just fine. Plus I spoil him rotten with treats and cuddles. So it's a fair trade.",dogs,3
"I bought this car seat in anticipation of making several long road trips this fall. I wanted something comfortable and safe for my dear dog Benny, a 3-year old miniature poodle.Hubby and I took Benny out for several one-hour trial runs over the past few weekends and Benny seems to love this seat. First of all, it boosts him up high enough so that he can comfortably look out the window (while still being safely tethered to the seat). Second, having ordered the larger model, he can stretch out and sit or sleep without being cramped. And third, and most important, is that while wearing his comfortable, stretchy Puppia harness, we can tether him to the seat belt, which secures the car seat just like a child's car seat. This gives Benny enough ""give"" to move from side to side in the seat, but in the event of slamming on the brakes, he'll stay secured and not end up a hood ornament (hopefully lol).Be warned - this model is BIG. I have it in the back seat (2nd row) of my SUV and it takes up half the seat. Instead of room for 3 people, there's now room for only 1. No bother. He's my only ""kid"".",dogs,3

When you have a ton of dogs in your home the bigger the bag the better!! I was not expecting the bag to be so HUGE! I am VERY HAPPY!! They will be great for my many kids and they are great for the tiny pups too since they are only about the size of a nickle each!

"I bought this but unfortunately it did not work on my 4 month old lab mix at all (he is 26 lbs). He ignored it the whole time, or just did not hear it. It stopped my 3 year old dachshund the first few times I used it, but after that he did not bother with it. Our next door neighbor's Rottweiler also simply ignore it.The only thing it seemed to do was drive my cats crazy. My guess is that it only really works on really small dogs.",dogs,3
"I have had my dog on K9 Advantix all summer, and just now started on the Frontline due to a customer service issue with the Advantix. Living on Long Island, which is one of the highest density Lyme Disease and flea areas of the eastern seaboard, it's important to me that when i take my dog to the state parks, he comes back without ""friends"". All summer and up until about a week ago (which coincides with our first walk in the state park since being on Frontline), he never had fleas, and I can count on one hand the number of ticks I found on him. With our first treatment of Frontline, approximately 2 weeks into it, he is biting and scratching like a maniac; when I washed him with flea shampoo, I could watch the fleas jumping off!I'm VERY disappointed in this product, especially since I now have 5 months ($50 worth) that Amazon will not allow me to return because of the chemicals within it, that I will NOT be using. K9 Advantix will have all of my future business because this stuff doesn't work. If I'd known Amazon's return policy on it, you can also bet I would not have bought 6 months at a time.So, I guess I'm very disappointed in both the product and Amazon's lack of up-front return policy acknowledgement.",dogs,3

Sadly, poor Bad Cuz lost his feet and ears on the first day, but the rest of him has been indestructable so far, and my pup loves the unique squeaking noise it makes (different than the usual squeaky toys). It is by far one of his favorite toys. Highly recommend!",dogs,3

I was worried about cords, and other various type plug in styles, since I've seen proof of my doxies chewing through 'chew proof,' dog-proof,' and supposedly 'endless playtime' toys, among other objects.

"Our Siamese cat has had countless problems from consuming some toxic chemicals (Xmas tree water) - years ago, before we realized what he was doing. For years, he's had an assortment of problems, leading up to a general decline in health at the ripe old age of ten - and ten isn't old for a Siamese. We've had him on 'gold-plated' cat food for years, which helped some, but not enough!SAMe has done the trick!Since putting him on this supplement, he's much more active and outgoing, besides losing some weight and not throwing up.What I like best about this supplement is that they've put the necessary supporting vitamins and Milk Thistle in with the SAMe, thereby preventing homocysteine buildup, providing better liver support, and getting most of the required nutritional supplements into one pill.Wish they had one for humans! :) My SAMe is plain, so I have to buy and take extra other supplements.Thank you for this great supplement - and for getting it to me so fast!",dogs,3
"Our dog Callie loves these treats. Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course) We bought 2 more bags. Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited. She has the nose of a lab. She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways. They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite. One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give. You can give 1 or 10. The bag never seems to finish. There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits. We love them also because they are healthier than other treats. She loves them because they are good. That's all that matters. By the way you can't beat the price.",dogs,3

"I purchased my unit in February '08 and installed it sometime in March (I had non-standard plumbing and this slowed the works slightly.) From reading other reviews, I would say I have the version with the most common bugs worked out, and I have had virtually NO mechanical problems with the unit so far (4 months or so). It seems like longer than that since I last had to deal with lugging litter around and cleaning the vile box. I love my Cat Genie.Good points:-It does what they say it does. What a Godsend for the basically lazy.-A person entering my home will not be immediately informed by their nose, that cats are within.-My cats adapted to it nearly instantly and really appreciate the clean litter box.-So far, no mechanical problems.-No ""baked poo"" problems as reported by others.-A vast improvement over doing it by hand.Not quite so good points but entirely liveable...-I hate ""perfumes"" etc so I ordered the ""unscented Sani-solution"", it still has more smell than I like, but I can live with it.-The litter does track petty badly. However it is really quite innocuous, and I have the mats and cover which keep this down to a managable level. I cannot imagine using it with an enthusiastic ""kicker"" of litter unless I had all of the accessories.-Haven't tought my cats to flush, but this was true of the old system where they simply used the toilet directly...MOST of the time. They are far more reliable with the Cat Genie. Besides they are getting older.",cats,2

The rubber on the bottom is not some cheap gasket-type ring that rots off in a few months. It's permanently attached and built into the bottom of the bowl. It's very durable and works like a charm to keep the bowl in place for even enthusiastic eaters.

Most did very good with it. One threw up, so didn't use it on him anymore. If you have a lot of fleas you need to give a flea bath first. Otherwise the sick fleas jump off and infest your house if they live - most likely they are already infesting your house. This spray should be used if you see one or two fleas and are doing the regular flea maintenance (drops, etc) on your pet. Fleas are very resistant to everything and very bad in the fall. This helped rid them, just make sure you use lightly as it is a strong pesticide.This ONLY last a few days, so you may want to reapply lightly once a week in the worst of the flea season.Note, you pet may be sleepy after application if he licks it a lot.",dogs,3

"Thank God for the refills. My cat likes to catch the 'bird' and drag it off to his secret lair (i.e. under the coffee table). Since he's so active playing with it I like to leave him enjoy his prize. However, this doesn't bode well for how long the feathers last. He also gets revitalized with each new bird (probably cos the older ones get chewed up so fast).",cats,2
"This litter box has ended my need to scoop daily. It's clean, it's quiet and my cat also loves it. Enough said.PS- The cartridges do not last 30 days but who cares? You just go out to the store and buy a new one. All done.",cats,2
"I suffer from occasional sore knees and experience pain performing simple task like walking steps. In addition I've increased my work outs. (Spin Classes, 3 days a week). After searching the web for Glucosamine, I did learn that Glucosamine Sulfate is the more beneficial than the Glucosamine HCL.I just completed the second week of taking Glucosamine Sulfate 1000mg 100 Tablets, I see improvement. As far as the price there are other brands less potent and more expensive, Pill size is similar in size to a multi-vitamin. Jarrow's pill is an effective product and a reasonable price.",dogs,3

"I use this conditioner regularly on my two cockapoos. Its perfect for softening their coat before brushing and smells great. It also seems moderately effective at preventing matting - though I'd welcome a product that could do a better job.

"The squeaker stopped working almost right away, and this is from a dog that is not a strong chewer. If your dog likes to squeak, don't bother with this. As a regular chew toy it will probably last a while, but it is less firm than a regular tennis ball and may not hold up to a big chewer.",dogs,3

I got this for wet food because it had ice packs for the bottom. Their is a flaw in the design. The motor key point doesn't secure the rotating plate. Cat's are very smart.

There's a small space between the crate walls and the plastic bottom that is big enough for a my chihuahua to get his paws stuck in; in fact he did the first night, but he figured out not to do that.

"My dog is a basset, a hyper basset. He is always on the go and chewing various toys that we give to him. We baught this toy thinking he would use it alot (bassets are know for their noses) but when it does get his attention it is only for a brief time because no matter how much he rolls it and despite the different treats and amounts we have put into it, nothing comes out. They only come out some of the time when we try to do it ourselves.Unless your dog goes for a while without enforcement, this toy is not for your dog.I only wish we could return it.Hope this helps.",dogs,3
"Our husky shredded this toy easily within a couple of days and we had to take it away from her. Alas, it does not hold up to hard chewers as well as some other stuffed animal toys. The belly is intact, but once the neck, arms, and legs start to unravel, the stuffing falls out. Perhaps this toy would be more durable with less aggressive chewers.",dogs,3
Experience,dogs,3
"These chews are quite rigid and they have some sharp points on them. We have had some bloody stool with these so I will not be buying again. Part of this may be my dog not chewing them thoroughly so if your dog chews carefully you may have a better experience. I have a beagle that's kind of a chow hound so probably the pieces get swallowed before they're truly ready to go. But I also buy bison or buffalo tendons and have never had that problem with them. They seem to be softer, more fleshy. This is also true of things like bully sticks and yak milk chews, whether they are not as sharp or they digest easier, I'm not sure but we've had no problems. I may look for another brand and see if we have a better experience with those, as the beef tendons are definitely more cost effective than the bison tendons.",dogs,3

"I love this brand and type of plant for my aquarium. Our local pet store only carries the small and medium, so when I found the large online - I ordered immediatly. They are the best and I will continue to purchase this brand.However, with in 2 hrs of having the plants in the tank our pleco became entangled in the grass like plant (it is made poorly and left with jagged edges) and cut up his fins very badly. The wider leaf plant is perfect though.",fish aquatic pets,4
"The first two or three times I put this on my dog (yellow lab-5 months old), she threw a fit. She rolled in the grass trying to get it off and our walk took four times as long. But, we stuck with it and now I won't walk without it. She still tries to rub it off from time to time, but she has stopped pulling and walks beside me. I can even walk her while pushing a stroller which I wasn't able to do once she got over 20 lbs. My friend also swears by it for her golden who is a great dog & very well behaved.

"You can't beat the ingredients in this food for the price, all of our dogs love it and do great on it. You can pay more for garbage foods like Eukanuba, Iams and Science Diet but WHY? The first FOUR ingredients in this food are MEAT..not corn or unknown meat by-products..also includes duck and salmon farther down the list. When you feed better quality food you feed LESS food, a lot of people don't realize that. I have a yellow lab, a carolina dog, an eskimo and a pom, the 35 lb bag of Chicken Soup last just about a month. When I moved in my b/f was feeding his dogs Dog Chow (which in his defense he thought was good food, being a ""name brand"" and all he had NO clue he was feeding them McDonalds every day) and was going through 30 lbs a month just for his 2 (the eskie and the pom).Are there better foods out there? Sure for a bigger price tag and most of the same ingredients. I would say this is one of the best quality foods you can buy at this price point, really it isn't much more than that bag of Dog Chow or similar food and when you figure in that you would feed about 1/2 of what you are now you end up saving.",dogs,3

"My dog chewed up the ""rope"" that stops up the bottle into dangerously large pieces in a manner of minutes. Note that in the ""Medium/Large"" photos for this item the stopper appears to be an actual purple and white rope, but the item I received had the solid purple soft rubber ""rope"" that appears in the ""Small"" photos. This design is completely unsuited for even moderately powerful chewers. I never would have bought this item had the photographs been accurate.",dogs,3

"I won't bore you with all the pros and cons of previous reviews. I have been satisfied with the 4 or 5 times we have used them. Other concerns of DOA or short life can be mitigated by buying from a good company like Amazon. Just to add my experience. I have owned two ( purchased from Amazon )for over a year and have learned to work through the programming issue. We are using them as vacation suppliment feedings for a large and a medium Retriever mix dogs. The small bite Pedigree dog food we use does jam the feeder if you do not manually override the program and let it operate a couple of times before leaving it unattended. It is probably as a result of a few things. First the dispenser vanes are very flimsy plastic for the size pellets. Secondly, the dispenser vanes should be set manually to form a V (looking from the top) before putting the storage bowl on top so that the food does not jam them during it's first turn. Finally do not overfill and squeeze the top on as the compacting of the food doesn't help. The new batteries will last 5-7 days depending on quality. Protect from the elements. We are using them outside but covered by porch and behind x-large dog portable kennel. One last consideration. The amount of food may vary by pellet size so experiment with times and amounts dispensed.",cats,2
"I was expecting a cover similar to what came with my cat's heat pad. I expected a thin faux fleece cover with elastic on the corners. I wasn't happy about the price, but needed a back up cover. What I got was so much nicer!! It is a fleece cover with a complete back and zipper closure. It will cover the head pad completely and zip up to the cord. Definately worth the price. By the way, I have two of these heat pads, one is outside in a little house for my outdoor kitty, and one is inside for my indoor kitty. Both cats love their pads. Keeps them warm in our Ohio winters.",cats,2

"With two cats, it is always best to be prepared and this product makes it simple. I have tried a self cleaning litter box that never performed as well as advertised. I also used the usual litter tray that I hand scooped every day and although that was easy enough, nothing beats the ease of use that this litter box offers. Simply tilt the box to the right and the litter sifts into the mesh area leaving the clumps with all the ""business"" to fall into the long receptacle. Grasp the protruding handle and slide the receptacle full of dirty litter out and empty it into a trash bag. Slide the receptacle back in, tilt the litter box to the left to allow the clean litter to sift back into the box and you're done. ""No fuss, no muss."" It all takes about 15-20 seconds and everything remains clean both in appearance and reality.",cats,2

It is comfortable, light weight, and seems to be of very sturdy construction.Inside the riding compartment are two clips to which you can attach a short leash.

I have found they are wonderful for keeping pet food fresher and keeping the mess down when I have to replenish the food bowls.

The filter gets clogged and has to be replaced sooner than you would think. My guys eat and drink in the same area so I would find mushy food stuck in the filter and on the bottom.

You just drop them in the hole and shake a little to get the kibbles into a compartment. You can turn to adjust it to minimize or maximize the ability to get the kibbles. I have a small dog (8to 10 lbs.) and it took a bit of time over several days of me pushing it for him to catch on. But he did catch on and can roll to get kibbles, sometime one, sometime more. He will get frustrated when the kibbles don't come out, but I would say it's a good item. Entertaining until they run low, but you do not want them eating too much. It can equal a meal.

"I purchased the Bergan Turbo Scratcher after reading the reviews on Amazon. I looked around at my local pet stores for this item first but then realized, they were charging twice as much as Amazon! I never have a hard time finding $25 to qualify for the free shipping offer. My 13 week old kitten just couldn't get enough of it when we first got it out of the package! Now today, a few days later....it is not getting as much usage as I would like to see. I'm hoping she'll continue to play with it now and then. The scratcher is small enough to just slide under my couch when not in use. This product seems very durable and I can see it lasting for many years. It is also nice that the cardboard scratching area can be replaced overtime if it gets worn out. This product also came with a pouch of catnip that you can sprinkle into the cardboard scratching area that helps draw your cats to the toy. Overall, I recommend this product! Your kitten will love it and you will enjoy watching them play with it too!",cats,2

"My wife and I got this collar as a first try to get our basset hound puppy to stop barking at everything in sight. We were skeptical that a non-shock solution would work but we wanted to try this before we had to step up the next level. Amazingly, this collar stopped the problem barking almost instantly.When our basset is in the back yard she barks constantly at the mailman, next door neighbors, birds, lawn mower, everything. I put the collar on her and let her outside - she barked once, got sprayed and then ran around scared not knowing where the spray came from. This happened to her on maybe five or six times over the next few days and each time the spray got her to stop the constant barking. We then started alternating letting her out with and without the collar and the barking was almost completely gone. She'd let out one bark when the mailman came by but wouldn't repeat it, almost as if she realized that the barking would cause the spray (even though she wasn't wearing the collar). Even when I mowed the lawn, something that used to cause 30 minutes of non-stop barking at the mower, she remains calm and silent.One thing that may have helped this collar work for out basset is the fact that our dog is a big wimp and is easily frightened, even though she's incredibly stubborn. If you've got a dog that doesn't care what's going on around her then this might not work as well, but for our dog it has completely solved the barking problems.",dogs,3

I finally tried these peat granuals (I got one of the mesh bags and put about half of this box in that bag and into my canister filter). Within perhaps a week or two, it had brought both hardnesses and ph down to ideal readings for my tropical community tank. I am not overly averse to using chemicals to treat a tank if it's what works best, but this just had that Occam's Razor feel that it was 1) Natural, 2) Relatively cheap and 3) Incredibly effective!

"I was told that my rescue dog, who never had toys as a puppy, would never learn to play with them. I've tried several throughout the 7 1/2 years I've had her, but it wasn't until I got these, that my little 9 1/2 year old eskie's eyes got wide with anticipation. Whenever my husband or I enter a room, she runs ahead and announces our arrival by getting one of these toys, throwing it up in the air, catching it, and squeaking away. It warms my heart. She plays fetch with with them and when she is tired of the game, this little fur-ball runs into her house with the toy. She loves to use them as pillows and loves to squeak the eggs when she gets one out. These toys are worth every penny!",dogs,3

"My little Cav.KingCharles girl and I are quite happy with the Joint Treats; not only does she love the taste, but actually, after being on them for over 8 months, seems to run around the yard more and faster!

"I got this leash for my 85 pound, very exuberant, Giant Schnauzer. It's only been about six weeks since we got it but so far, it's been great. The dog has really given it a workout and its held up perfectly. Hope it still holds together after a year or so. I'm glad I paid the extra for a well-made leash; I know a lesser one would have failed by now.Update, 9/2012The dog has slowed down, just like me but this leash is as strong as new. If she had offspring I could hand this down for generations.",dogs,3

"I was looking to replace a larger version of this monkey for my 39 pound shiba/pitbull/shepherd mix but didn't read close enough on the description. This thing is only about 1inch x 2 inches in size, weighing less than 1 oz. he'd probly choke on it before he could play with it. and for a price of ~$3 with more than double that in shipping, this toy is pretty much a joke. at least offer free shipping or something. this thing could easily fit in a small padded envelope. But mostly, i'm just disappointed at my own oversight hence 3 stars rather than 2.The larger one is very nice though especially since it is shipped directly from amazon.com and if you're like me with the amazon prime account, shipping is free so for the same price (about $8), you can either get this tiny choke toy, or a bigger one (approx 3x8in).",dogs,3

"When my original one finally died after probably 10 years of service, I tried to find the same thing only to find they have changed the style and the new ones are horrible. I was able to locate my old style on Amazon. This one really does work with minimum upkeep. I have two cats. Works for a week long vacation with two cats. Wish they would go back to manufacturing this style. Tried other brands and nothing else worked well, just this particular model.",cats,2

"Last spring, I acquired a kitten (Mink) whom I took hiking (on a leash) daily. When she tired, I placed her in the Outward Hound for a free ride home. By the time we left on an extended cross-country camping trip in July, Mink was acclimated to both the leash and the backpack.After nearly 3 months camping, we're home. On the road though, we hiked in 17 states and Mink was good for about a mile or so on the trail, then she'd curl up in the Outward Hound. She's right at home in the OH -- has even sneaked into several businesses and museums that way.Outward Hound is a boffo idea and well-constructed. I'd highly recommend it -- if you firmly believe you can train your pet to like it. I've suggested the manufacturer make even larger sizes because my 9 month old, 10 pound kitten will soon outgrow this one --ARGH! Then what?",cats,2

"This product kills fleas but it will NOT rid you of the problem. It will appear like it did, but don't be fooled!This is how I got rid of my INFESTATION 1 year ago:PART A:1. Give Capstar and have cat wait while cat is in your tub with about 2 inches of water only. Your cat will hate it. However, dead fleas will drop and the 2 inches will work as a ""double tap"" from Zombieland. Live fleas will try to ""escape"" and will drown. This way they won't spread in your home. Wait for like 10 minutes and then let the water go down the drain.2. Get a huge pot or container to use as your ""kitty bath"". Make sure it's ready to go before you start. Combine vinegar, some flea shampoo, and warm water. Have it ready! Have a small plastic cup. Dunk your cat's body in the kitty bath BUT NOT THE HEAD. The noise of running water might freak out your cat so it's best to just have additional warm water at hand to pour over it with your cup.3. Lather your furry one with flea shampoo. Careful with the eyes.4. Pick off all the fleas you can find. This step sucks but you have to do it. Don't pop them, just have a bowl of soapy water to drown them. Pick, stick your hand deep in the bowl, and let go. When I was ""done"" that bowl was FULL of dead fleas.5. Rinse. Repeat steps 3 and 4. This time pay extra attention to the face and under the chin/neck, butt, tail. Fleas are not totally dumb and will rush to that safe area that hasn't been dunked and to the extremities. This will be hard and your back might hurt but you have to get through it.6. Make sure your cat is not cold. Keep the temperature nice, as soon as you pull your cat from the water roll it up in a towel. Once that towel has absorbed a lot of water, get a new towel. Put a hair dryer on low and begin to warm up/dry your furry friend.I did all of part A at least 2 times with each cat. Btw don't use the same nasty water and wait at least 3 days to give them another pill! Yes, I got scratched and smelled like wet cat. Yes, I was tired and almost gave up. Yes, one of my cats pooped in my bath tub.PART B:1. Get Orvitrol Spray and have it ready4. Shave your cat. DON'T SHAVE THE WHISKERS. But Yes. Shave it. Even if it's a short hair breed. Trust me. Shave your cat. Have someone help you hold it down as you work. Get some groomer gloves if you need to. If it's a long hair cat first cut the hair with scissors and then shave away the rest. Spray the fur with Orvitrol and bag it up. Dispose. There will be fleas in the fur that drops to the ground.3. Salt (that's right, I salted our ENTIRE apartment except our bed, appliances, and counter tops. Works just like borax, except it won't be toxic for your cats when they lick their coat). This will be SO annoying. But it really does help. The salt pierces the flea skin and they bleed to death. You will feel like a crazy person. You will be exhausted after part A. Let the salt sit as long as you possibly can stand it. I could only take 4 days. Then vacuum it all up. Immediately dispose of the bag. If you have a bagless one make sure you throw all the junk out and clean it well. I felt like I was in a weird combination of hell and the North Pole. My apartment was white. I had salt under my nails.4. DIY flea/insect traps. Place shallow pans of water with a drop of dish soap all over your home. Believe it or not this will trap more than just fleas. I used those big disposable aluminum pans and other random objects. Your cats will not be stupid enough to drink this water as long as they have fresh clean water available to them.5. Wash all bedding/clothes/etc. Add vinegar to your laundry detergent.6. Orvitrol your bed, couch, drawers, curtains, closets, and all those comfy cat areas. You might have to keep your cats in one room of the house for a while.1. Monitor your cat daily. Pick fleas, and drown them in a bowl! You need to look hard but you have to do it. Give them another kitty flea bath as needed.PART C:1. Begin to put a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar in your cat's drinking water (the organic type with the little brown flakes or ""mother"" in it). I have 2 cats and the other one refused to drink the water. I used a plastic syringe (without the needle) and put it at the side of it's mouth (near the back). Slowly squirted some and the cat drank by reflex. This will fight fleas and also has a bunch of other health benefits. Continue doing this.2. Get a good spot treatment like Advantage. Don't waste your time with those cheap Walmart types.3. Do a flea bath every 4 months for prevention. My cats hated water at first but they grow more and more used to it each time.Sorry for any typos, it's 3 am and I felt like helping someone out!",cats,2
"We had a collar very similiar years ago for training purposes. It must have been a different brand. Unfortunately I can not remember the name.

I haven't found a parrot food that is so universally loved by my birds. My only complaint is that they fall apart so easily. I would estimate that only about a quarter of each nugget is actually ingested by my birds. And, that may be an over estimate. Still, no matter what they eat, it's the same story. Most of what they eat ends up on the bottom of the cage.",birds,0

"I got these as a treat for my golden that can't tolerate fish oil on his food. Both of my goldens absolutely love them, but they are seriously stinky. When I use them as training treats I always have to wash my hands after. Also, since they are rounded, if I drop them they roll away which distracts the dogs - a small problem when we are training. I've ordered them several time as training treats after the first shipment, but they don't really supplement the oil like I'd hoped. Really good for dogs that might not like the typical treats.",dogs,3

"I saw that someone marked this review as unhelpful. They must work for the company that makes Frontline. Everyone who reads this should go do an online search of ""frontline seizures""; I read the same exact story over and over, including stories of people whose pets died. I would NEVER give the pets I love a product that had ANY chance of causing a grand mal seizure or death. The seizures my dog started having at 7 years old commenced after I began using Frontline Plus. Within a day or two of application he was having grand mal seizures - which made it difficult to pinpoint the cause. I took him to the vet - blood, urine, fecal matter, kidneys, liver, everything checked; he is perfectly healthy. I would not recommend anyone use these products. I now give him a combination pill for fleas, heartworm and parasites and he has been fine. It is more expensive - but having a pet is a luxury, not a right, and they cost money.I am not an alarmist or reactionary - this happened three times before I figured it out. He weighs 90 pounds so size is not a determinant. There is too much ancillary evidence to ignore this, in addition to the reality that these products are necessarily poison to enable them to kill fleas. Since I have discontinued the use of Frontline, he has been fine.",dogs,3

They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or ""like"" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried.

"Ever try to give your dog a bath? It wiggles out in the yard and gets dirt and ticks all over the fur--stickers,too--before you can ever dry it off. Mom and dad used the bathtub to clean our dog--mine! To this day a pile of grease and dirt is so stained on the porcelain we can never clean it off. Heck, I only take showers in it, it's SO dirty. This waterless pet cleaning brush worked fine. It's easy to use and it lifts all the tick and lice eggs off the pet without hurting or infecting it with wetness. It also keeps the fur from matting up and will untangle a lot of matting in the hair. Our dog is gone now after almost twenty years. She lived that long because we used this brush instead of a bath where dogs pick up colds, fevers, and more ticks afterwards. Experts say you should almost never give your pet a bath--it dissolves natural protective oils in the fur. Of course, injury or exposure to a lot of dirt are exceptions.",dogs,3

Simply Google something like ""Sergeant's Gold Squeeze-on Bald Spot"" or ""Sergeant's Gold Squeeze-on sick"" and you will find TONS of information. Some pets were not as fortunate.Try the same thing with any other flea treatment like Frontline, and the links you get will still take you back to horror stories about Sergeant's Gold.

I first treated the area with this cleaner, leave it in for a few minutes and sucked it up with my carpet steam cleaner! It worked like a charm!

Very well made, collapses sort of tricky - it's like one of those twisty sunshades for the car but once you try to collapse it few times you'll figure it out.

The thing I like best about this toy is that it fits his small puppy dog food, so I can just insert his day-to-day food without worrying about his diet being affected. It is HARD plastic so it is not a chew toy for his teeth like some of the other puzzles, and on our hardwood floors it can make a bit of a racket causing me to wonder about the scratch factor on the floors (but, oh well we have a dog AND kids). Our pup was scared of it for the first few weeks due to the noise it makes but now it is one of his favorite puzzle toys. It has two settings",dogs,3
"Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies. I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food. I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve. His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks. He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor. We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea. Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.",dogs,3
"I'm an animal trainer and behaviorist, and spend the majority of my time working with dogs with behavioral problems. I consider aversives to be a last ditch effort to save a dog's life when all else fails, and I'm happy to say that, thanks to StayAway, I haven't ever had to use more severe products like the Scat Mat (which emits an electric shock when touched.)I use this product primarily for stopping counter-surfing dogs when alternatives aren't enough. A few StayAways placed strategically along the counter tops has successfully stopped even the most hardcore counter surfing dogs from stealing things off the counter or table - even when the counter is baited with a tasty treat like broiled chicken - after just a few sprays. I do not typically use the warning beep, but it is a handy function to have!I've tried Premier's comperable product, and was highly dissatisfied with the quality, among other things, so decided to try Contech's product instead. I now have four StayAways, and only turn them on while in the process of training; my only gripe about this product is that when turned on, it emits three blasts of air (which wastes the product) and it still eats through batteries. I would also really like a wider range of adjustability, and a narrower blast of air. Despite these flaws, the product does what it claims to do, and overall, I'm extremely satisfied with it!",cats,2
"We could not keep my small dog's water bowl full long enough before getting this product. Turned out she'd become diabetic and a common symptom is drinking lots AND LOTS of water.

No longer did she have to wait hours before someone refilled her previous little water bowl.",cats,2
I'm disappointed in the lousy reviews I've been reading. I've had this pan for years without any problems whatsoever. I was so happy with the pan that I bought one for my parents' 3 cats. They like using it too. The only thing I would change would be to give it a larger litter area. This pan has worked flawlessly for many years. I'm considering buying another one just to have a newer one again.,cats,2
"I was a bit leery about ordering this stand given the negative reviews about shipping/packaging and missing parts. I ordered it anyway. The stand is ok, though it does have some rust visible from various screw holes. The packaging is the worst I have ever seen in all my years of ordering via the internet and from Amazon in general. Surprisingly, all the parts were included and undamaged. The bird seems to be hanging securely away from toddlers and my dogs (my main concern), but the jury is still out on the product. We may still return it. I would not recommend this bird stand to anyone, even for the inexpensive price.UPDATE",birds,0

"My complaint about this product is that it shorts out if anything is set on it. The whole point was that my dog steals food off the counter. I wanted to be able to set food on the scat mat so he would be shocked if he went for it. But you can't do that. However, my cats won't go near the counter now that they have been shocked once on low setting. So very effective for them. Wish it came with a plug in as part of the price (which I consider pretty darn high).",dogs,3
All you need to do is read J H Minde's review. Put's it straight and clear. They need to include a less than zero rating though this wouldn't even get that from me. I own this disgusting piece of advanced technology and I'd rather have a good old litter box to scoop every day than it. I've owned it for about 3 months and spent more time and money on it than I care to think about. Everything in Minde's review is exactly what I've experienced. YOU ARE CRAZY TO PURCHASE THE LITTERMAID ELITE. You have been warned. And I paid far more than this price offer which really makes me crazy.,cats,2

"I'm thrilled that companies are coming out with natural litter products (as I was very concerned about the chemical clay stuff I had been using for my cat all of these years). I bought some of the Feline Pine (which I absolutely LOVE), but the Feline Pine original does not clump, so I bought the Swheat Scoop as a supplement to add a little clumping power to my Feline Pine. I was disappointed, as the Swheat does not clump at all. I'm glad that I that I didn't buy the Swheat product alone, as I wouldn't have been happy with my purchase. I prefer the Feline Pine because there's no dust and mess to have to sweep up all the time. Swheat is a great concept if it really clumped like it is supposed to. I would still prefer the Swheat over that chemical stuff I had been using in the past.",cats,2

I gave this to my 50 pound lab mix and it took him about 10 minutes to pull out the end of the rope from the knot and start fraying it. Instructions tell you to discard the toy if it becomes frayed so it made for a very disappointing buy. I would only recommend this for a very light chewer.,dogs,3

"We have two of these and are very happy with how they look. They are attractive and look so much better than a litter box. One tip that worked for us is that we purchased a fairly shallow litter pan to put inside versus the one that is paired wih it on Amazon. It makes it easier for the cat to enter the structure. I am so addicted to Amazon, but I actually went to a pet store to pick out the litter pan to make sure it was the correct one that would work.",cats,2

You can spot clean with Chlorox wipes. Or take the shelves out and wash them during a full cleaning. The shelves can be tricky getting placed on just the bar you want them to, because of the snug fit. But once they're on, no critter can move them!Plenty of space to add hammocks, toys, and a litter box. Highly recommend for anyone with rats!",bunny rabbit central,1
"I bought two of the Lookout II car seats for my French Bulldogs. We were going to be on a two day trip as I moved more than 1100 miles. I did not want my dogs to spend 18 hours in the car in their kennels and these car seats were exactly what I needed. They arrived in a timely manner according to the product specifications described. The tupperware drawer was perfect for storing their leashes and treats and other miscellaneous items. I have since left the car seats in my car and used them for carting my dogs around town to vet appointments, parks, etc. I am absolutely thrilled with the purchase and have considered buying them as gifts for my other family members with dogs.",dogs,3

"I've decided to write a review, because I'm shocked by all of the other reviews! I bought this toy on clearance at Target about 6 months ago. I paid around $7 for it then, and it was the best $7 I've ever spent on a dog toy for my golden retriever/border collie mix. First, I have to mention that she is incredibly destructive when it comes to new toys. It is absolutely pointless to continue buying her stuffed toys, since they are ripped apart and spread throughout the house within 3 minutes. This has been one of the few toys that has actually lasted this long. Second, when I first brought the toy home, she did not want anything to do with it. That was until I showed her how it works! Because of her dog breed, she is very hyper and energetic, and this has to be her favorite toy and game to play. I am considering re-purchasing a back-up and another for a Christmas present to a friend who has a large dog that likes to play but chews most toys. Third, after 6 months of use, and I mean this toy is played with a lot, it has normal ""wear and tear"" but it's not going to break anytime soon. My pup can chew through just about anything but has yet to rip this apart. There are teeth marks that are permanently indented, but no tears.",dogs,3
"We just found out that my oldest cat has FIC. Main factors for managing this disease include reducing stress, increasing water intake and reducing weight. I have 3 cats...the oldest is 5, then 4, then 2. Before the 2 year old came along the 2 oldest were pretty good with each other. They would cuddle on the bed and play. All 3 are rescued and when we brought the 2 year old home she was only about 6 or 7 months. My oldest doesn't like her very much, is jealous, aggressive and they growl like they are man eating beasts (!!) at each other. They would also get in spats and then the middle ""child"" beats up on the oldest because she thinks the oldest is picking on the youngest. They are definitely like children.When my cat first got sick the vet asked about stress and I told her the above. She recommended Feliway, which I had never heard of, and I immediately ordered it. I then had to take her to a specialist for her diagnosis, he recommend the Feliway also! I read many reviews on this product before purchasing. Everyone says to give it at least 2 weeks to begin working and wait a month before you make your decision about it. I have had it plugged in for approximately 1 month...what a huge difference it has made! Now the oldest and youngest don't mess with each other. They will even sit near each other and eat close to each other. Strangest thing! Everyone seems to be very happy now and there is no aggression...just a little (tiny) bit of playfulness. I am eager to see how their future together pans out now. =)",cats,2

Heck, they probably think I'm secretly hoarding zoo animals.

"I hate to admit it but I've been just going to my local pet store for their free water tests for the last year or so. They use those stip tests. One problem is that they aren't as accurate as a kit such as this. Another problem is that if you feel there might be a problem with your tank, by the time you get to the pet store the next day and get back home, everything in your tank might be dead.This kit comes with incredibly simple, easy to follow instructions. I was a little nervous about the measurements of the chemicals but the bottles have a dropper top (sorry if that's not a real phrase) that is amazingly accurate and forgiving. My first attempt at checking all 4 levels went smoothly, and I was impressed that my tank was just about perfect. Now I can test every week for the next four years (my kit has an expiration date of 4 years from now, meaning I'm paying less than $5 a year for this).If you're worried about dealing with chemicals or worried that it might be complicated or difficult, have no fear.

She also doesn't pay attention to it or seem bothered by it all when it's on, so it must be pretty comfortable.I haven't walked her too many times on it yet but it seems to hold in place pretty well. It never seemed like she could get out of it.My only complaint is that due to the weight of the clips, it shifts to one side and then sits on her crookedly, even with the harness adjusted pretty tightly.

I bought the bungee attachment, but although it works for allowing for for lunging it is rather heavy and will bang against my legs while running.

"I would have given it 5 stars, but the first one I received was defective. I tried to get a refund from Amazon, but they wouldn't accept a return. However, the product is guaranteed by the manufacturer, so they replaced it (after I mailed it back at my expense...ugh!) I put it on my toy poodle (about 18#'s)when he's out in the yard and it has curbed his barking considerably. Sometimes a few low barks (lol...like little coughs)... get past the microphone. (I think he's figured out he can bark if he does so quietly). But,evidently there's not much fun in that as he wants to come back inside right after. I keep the collar off (and turned off to save the battery life)when he's indoors.I'm pleased with the results and really do recommend it. It is a gentle correction and seems the most humane choice to put an end to excessive barking. Just be aware, if your dog continues to bark and ends up needing something more powerful, you can't return this product to Amazon and the manufacturer will only replace defective collars, not refund the purchase price.",dogs,3
"For those of us with a long work day who are pet owners, this type of device solves one of the most distressing problems - how to make sure your fuzzy little companions are well nourished while you go about your business.I had my concerns about this item taking over the emotional role of ""the hand that feeds"" but it quickly became obvious that my cats recognized this artificial imposter for what it was - I was still their target for affections!There is a dark side to this dispenser of crunchy pet nuggets, however. My 6-year-old nephew Timothy came to visit us last week. While we were out at the store, he filled the entire resevoir of this device up with little yellow Lego(tm) man heads, and then constructed an elaborate throne room next to it.We caught him pantomiming strange and violent rituals where the Lego(tm) king would order one of his peasants to dispense a severed head, and then play soccer with it.

"This probably is the best, most quality, most luxurious leash I've ever held!It's on par with the other ones from Flexi, however this leash is a bit bigger, stronger, than the purple/pink one they sell.Good for dogs upto 40LBS, calm dogs perhaps 50LBS.",dogs,3

I got this to slow down how fast my cat ate her cat treats. Its not too difficult for the cat to get the treats out. She is a lazy cat too and figured out how to push the ball around with her nose to release the treats. It does slow down her eating and is probably somewhat entertaining to her too.,cats,2
They served the intended purpose well. I will definitely purchase more. They exceeded my expectations. I have recommend them to others.,cats,2
"moo tubes arrived and are very different in size and much smaller than i assumed. the ones at my local pet store are more than double the size for not much more money, so i assumed these were the size of the ones at my expensive local pet store. i was disappointed at their small size and, very unhappy with their varied sizes. some were half the diameter of the one in the picture and with two dogs, if you dont give them equal sized products, one finishes first and then fights with the other for theirs. Consistent size does matter with doggies. these are about three bucks each. Petsmart has ones that are more than double the size right now for 2.50 each on sale and they are only 3.50 each regular price. i wont be buying these again.",dogs,3
"This is a great cat collar! My kitty is full grown, but still tiny. The regular collars are uncomfortably thick and dig into his neck. He was always scratching at them. This collar is so thin that it disappears into his fur and no more scratching! Yet it's still just as functional as other collars. Sliding mechanism is great too. Easy to put on, easy to tighten, but doesn't come loose when it's not supposed to. I'm going to buy another one for my newly adopted kitten. Thanks!",cats,2

Easy to install, our puppies adapted to having them on very quickly and were very happy to sit in their own bucket seat and be very happy and safe during our ride!!

"First, my cats no longer defecate and urinate on the landing of my stairs, so in that regard, this product was a success. However, I found it to be somewhat sporadic. Sometimes, I or the cats would walk by right in front it and it wouldn't go off. Then a few minutes later, I would just climb the stairs and it would go off when I was still 6 - 10 feet away. The good thing is, it goes off often enough that the cats learned to stay away. I only had a problem with my big Tom who figured out he could knock it over. I had to put it in a base and now the cats stay away.So while it isn't fool-proof, it seemed to do the trick in the end.",cats,2

"I have used this product multiple times to start quarantine tanks and hospital tanks (marine tanks, with both fish and coral.) It works; it's worked every time. I've never had my tanks spike ammonia or nitrite when using this product as directed. I'm amazed how many websites & forums claim that no such product exists. Also, the reviewer who says that you have to keep using it is wrong, for so many reasons (the bacteria don't get used up and die, they multiply, just like all bacteria, and also, all of the bacteria that would normally be in your tank if you cycle the traditional way will also still exist in the tank.) I've never used the product beyond 7 days, not even with water changes, and my tanks have never ""crashed"" when I stopped using this. I would, however, consider stocking the tank lightly, and gradually building up stock.",fish aquatic pets,4

"This product is great at removing any loose hair off of your pets. We have a dog and several cats and this works for all of them. Clean up is so very easy, just grab the hair off the comb and you are done. It can be a little messy while you are brushing your pet, so we try to do it outside whenever possible. The brushing action causes alot of hair to come loose, so if you do it inside be prepared to sweep or vacuum when you are done. When this is used with the shampoo, it works even better. We have noticed after a few months of regular use that our pets aren't leaving as much hair around the house as they used to. We would recommend this investment to any pet owner who is tired of sweeping up enough hair to make another animal.",cats,2
"it is waterproof. my dog still jumps between the two front seats, so i have to tell him to get back (so it isn't much of a barrier). i really do like this hammock, the only thing i wish is that the corners wouldn't fall forward, more attachments to keep the seats covered. i like that it has two pockets in it. amazing to see what dirt is not on my seat because of this, i love having it!",dogs,3
"We purchased the 3 gallon aquarium for my son's betta fish, Blowie the Scary. Blowie doesn't eat all of his food, and this filter does a great job of getting out the extra food and initial cloudiness when my son puts too much in. The filters are extremely easy to use and my 4-year old can change them himself. It's a really nice set, with easy filter maintenance and I'd recommend it. Sometimes it takes a day for the filter to clear enough out, but it's still high on my list.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Nothing gets my pet on a roll as well as this. My little rat terrier plays with this for hours on end - rolling on it, throwing up in the air. She LOVES it and it lasts and lasts. It's kind of hard to find the little one in the store, so I was glad to finally find it here.",cats,2

I have a large dog - 80 lbs, and a medium size dog - 55 lbs - and it fits them both... it calms both down completely - the puppy (55lb) went from a wigglefest for ear cleaning (she wants to eat the cleaning pads lol), to sitting nicely, nail trimming / grinding is better for both. Its easily put on and works like a charm.",dogs,3

"The concept for this product is sound and in fact is great - however, the implementation needs much to be desired. This divider is easy enough to put together, slide the mesh into the two long side bars. Unfortunately, it comes out just as easily letting the fish you are trying to separate co-mingle again. I put this thing together 3 times and re-inserted it into the tank and finally gave up. Instead of sliding it into place on the side bars, the side bars need teeth and need to fold over to clamp onto the mesh so that it cannot slide out of place. Or some other solution needs to be developed, but this is not working for my tank. I feel like super-gluing the mesh into place but I don't know what that would do to the fish or if it would hold under prolonged underwater exposure. I am so frustrated and disappointed.",fish aquatic pets,4
"this is a very well built feeder, made from sheet steel not cheap aluminium; the lid to fill the feeder is easy to operate, it has these arms that are made to hook onto the cage which makes it so secure that no animal can dislodge it once installed.the screen bottom keeps the food dry & allows the crumbs to fall through so you do not end up with a feeder full of crumbs.I do not remember how much it holds but you will not be disappointed with this purchase. I highly recommend this feeder",bunny rabbit central,1

I have 5 cats and the LitterMaid box has been wonderful. We own 3 boxes. Two are the original (5 yrs) and 1 Mega (2 years). I have had no problems at all with the original/small box but the Mega one acts up now and then. It's almost like they never made the motor larger to accomadate the Mega box. It sticks and stops ocassionally. I take them apart every 6 months and do a total cleaning on the box. I use the spray silicone on the rake to stop poopy sticks and also apply a coat on the bottom of the box. Seems alot of the complaints are due to poor reading skills of the instructions that come with the box. As far as cleaning the box.....just part of being a cat owner. Like another poster said....you wouldn't expect your bathroom to clean itself. All in all....we LOVE our LitterMaid.,cats,2
"It was guaranteed to work, but it didn't. I treated a few days old cat urine stain on the car carpet. I followed the instructions exactly, but the cat smell is still there, now mixed in with the product smell, which is not too great either. I'm going to refund my purchase.",cats,2

This is the best purchase I have made for my puppies. And I am going to buy another one. It arrived quickly. It is made well. And the dogs immediatly like it. I have a 2nd home and make a long 9 hour drive about once a month. I feel so much better having something for them to ride in the car so they are not walking around panting getting car sick and distracting the driver not to mention saving my car from another deep detail. I put off buying this smart invention because I thought it was pricey. Turns out I dont know how I will ever do without one! I use it for both the car (easy install ) and the house as a bed. I will recommend this item to every animal lover I know.,dogs,3
This arrived way early. Which was actually excellent. Opened the package and looked at it. Looked a lot like the other giggler balls that I've had for years til I noticed something. To my dismay the giggler ball here is actually one that makes noises when you shake the ball. It is not battery operated. So when you shake it back and forth the air compresses inside and causes a eh heh eh heh noise or a slight honky sounding noise. Doesn't resemble anywhere near a giggle. Though I'm extremely disappointed. it's more so in the lack of description. But the important thing is my Chloe (great Dane boxer mix dog) Approves of it completely. So that was the important thing was it made her happy *smiles* But I shall still continue on my quest to find the electronic giggle ball that is housed in the same rubber material as this ball is. So this ball is great for people who only need it to make noise when you shake it *laughs* I am deaf. I want the one that makes noise when it slightly moves. (I wear hearing aids which is why I can hear the ball)So I give it a 5 stars for craftsmanship and making my Chloe happy. 3 stars for lack of through description. Other wise it's good.,dogs,3

This food bowl has finally gotten her to feel like she always has food available to her, yet prevents her from rapidly overeating. The concept is brilliant. The construction and material of this ball are poor, though. It wiggles apart, and I've already had to replace one. I'd gladly pay more for a more durable product.",cats,2

"I adopted a large energetic pitbull mix puppy a month ago. The household also has two other dogs and four cats,which she finds way too entertaining. Since we live on five acres, I needed something that could get her attention at a distance & got this collar based on price, good reviews, and claimed water resistance.The collar has worked out great. I have only had to ""stimulate"" the beast twice, and on the lowest setting (try it out on yourself first; level two was as much as I wanted to use. There are 8 levels and IMHO, level 8 must be downright sadistic.) Now I only have to ""beep"" her and she stops what she is doing. We have a pond and the dogs swim in it all the time. So far the collar has no problem with being wet.Try shopping around before assuming Amazon has the lowest price, though.",dogs,3

"I have an Old English Sheepdog, Jasper, who is prone to ear infections and is allergic to California native grasses (yes, a dog allergic to grass!). We first used this product per a vet recommendation and it ended up irritating her ears (making them more red and itchy). So, the vet suggested Virbac Epi-Otic and that seems to make Jasper much happier. Some other reviewers suggest soaking a cotton ball and squeezing the solution out into the ear canal as more tolerable for the dog than squeezing it into her ear canal--I'm going to try that out because Jasper definitely doesn't like having the bottle squeezed anywhere near her ear. My vet also recommended that you don't have to worry about putting a decent quantity into the ear canal and then you should massage the ear to give the solution a chance to break up the debris in the ear before you let the dog shake it out or if you wipe out the ear canal with a paper towel (big dogs).",dogs,3

For me, that's sitting near THE SPOT when I'm home, making sure she walks on by to her litterbox. No, covering the spot doesn't work. She'll urinate right next to the cover, thus broadening her chosen SPOT.Be sure to get the rebate form from their website before tossing the receipt, just in case you come to the same conclusion that I have.",cats,2
"I purchased this collar for my beagle mix that pulls constantly on walks and forget it if another dog walks by! I had tried her regular collar, then a harness, neither did much good. This collar has worked well, she is much better (still pulls at the beginning of the walk but calms down quickly). I can adjust this high on her neck if I anticipate an incident (like another dog), and she really has no choice but to comply. The only thing that I don't care for is that I have to adjust it after is is on and again to take it off, I wish it just snapped together so it was always adjusted. I only use this collar for our walks, usually 3 times a day, so that means I have to adjust it 6 times a day. Having said that, I won't walk her without this collar, so I will tolerating the hassle of adjusting it every time. Our walks so much more pleasant.",dogs,3

"This filter system came with a very easy to follow setup DVD. Follow this and you can't go wrong. The filter system is very quiet but not powerful. It circulates the water not very well and has no force of a power head.A VERY nice product but not worth spending a little extra. Nice construction, easy setup,but not very functional!all this I say becouse I have a 50 gallon tank and this fluval 305 about 1 month and it did a bad job the water was not clear it all,even tough I follow the dvd extra careful,so please do not buy this filter fluval 305,i amnot rocommending it to no one with 50 gallon tank or more,you will be disapointed,I realy do not know what the ather reviews talking about,this is not at all clear water.I return this one to amazon,and I bought the Hagen Fluval Canister Filter FX5',now my tank crystal clear water,so please pay more $$$ but you will get what you are looking for >>>>>>>>crystal clear water&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,good luckso again I will not rocommend the fluval 305 it all for 50gl tank.....",fish aquatic pets,4

"My mother's dog has trouble with fleas as she lives in a heavy tourist area with dogs coming in from all over the country. She bought this as an inexpensive way to control the fleas but the reaction her poor dog had was extreme; she had to be hospitalized and extensively treated. This ""inexpensive"" treatment not only almost cost her the dog's life but she has many vet bills as well. Please do not risk your dog's health--there is no way of telling if it will react until you apply the medication!!",dogs,3

"I have tried everything to get rid of skunk spray; tomato juice, honey and vinager douche, soap and water, etc., but NOTHING works as well as Skunk Off. As soon as my dog gets sprayed, I first hose him off outside, and then spray him with Skunk off. I scrub it in an let it sit for a while and then wash him off again. I spray him again with Skunk Off, scrub it in, and wash again. I spray him a third time and leave it in. After this, he is OK to come in the house. He still has a little smell, but not much. I have a Siberian Husky with a thick coat of hair. I don't know what I would do without Skunk Off. I Strongly recommend it!",cats,2
"I read the majority of reviews that said it stopped the dogs barking in the first few barks and decided to give it a try. It works! Our dogs no longer bark at shadows, birds, leaves blowing across the ground, stuff like that. I LOVE these collars and only wish they came with a remote for the price.",dogs,3

"Got this to give it a shot. My bad knees make scooping litter agony. I had though this would help and it is fantastic. It is easy to roll and I have had no problems. Use less litter, roll at least weekly, neither is a chore really. Works with any litter too.I've got one BIG cat and one who doesn't cover her poop. I've had no problems with either. It's big enough for a large cat and catches even uncovered waste. No problems with clips breaking, just treat it nice and check them before you roll it. Roll till its almost on its far side then roll back and its scooped. Final verdict, this is *perfect*. I replaced all my boxes with this and happily. Awesome and works perfectly!",cats,2
"They have many products I have been highly satisfied with. I have two english bulldogs and do what I can to keep them as healthy as possible. It keeps costs way down at the vet. Just make sure you do your research about products first and confirm it's what you need. So far I have come to love these products, the topical cream with hydrocrotisone, the antibacterial rinse, dermapet benzoyl peroxide shampoo, mal-a-ket wipes by dermapet, and goodwinol ointment for demodetric mange (quite common when less than one year of age). It took me a lot of time finding the right products but those are all must haves. I hope this helps anyone as I managed to put it all in one place",cats,2
"Purchased this product with much trepidation....but, it made an incredible difference in our child (cat). Yes, the packaging did leak some product out, but overall wasn't that big a deal.

Give it a try.......it's waaaay better than constantly trying to discipline a behavior problem!",cats,2
"We received this product just a few days after ordering. Our hope was to eliminate being a doorman in the middle of the night. While we haven't quite gotten that far, we put it down to the 10 years of training our dogs have in this area. The dogs are making progress even though they seem to want ""permission to leave"" if we are home.The door was pretty easy to install, although we did purchase steel bolts and nuts to use in place of the plastic ones received. It is quite important to be absolutely certain the door is square and level in the opening or the flap will not function as intended. The flap is pretty noisy as it swings back and forth when the dogs use it, so if you can, install it as far from your bedroom as possible. It was nice that the door comes with a template. We did not need to use any weather strip around the dog door, but did use a bit of silicone sealant. The door we installed the dog door in is a steel door, so it matches nicely. Be sure not to install it too high from the bottom of the door.Although this product says it is for dogs up to 100 pounds, our husky mix weighs about 65 pounds and pretty much fills the opening. A dog's general build will come into play here; perhaps a bulldog-type might not fit so well. I might have purchased the extra large door instead as our dog doesn't seem to like the sides of the door touching her.",cats,2

"This collar is easy to use and is very effective with our Labrador. It is much easier to use than our old collar, purchased several years ago for our other dog, and the actual collar unit is smaller and less cumbersome on the dog. The battery lasts for about 3 days before needing to be re-charged. Charging the collar and hand-held unit is very simple. The only drawback is that it takes about 12 hours to charge it, since we do a lot of RVing, powered by the generator when we are away from home. It has a good range with ample settings (tone only or tone & zap, and it is nice that the collar is water-tight. I chose this collar because of the ease of use and the range that it covers.",dogs,3
Love this collar as it is soft on the inside and edges. Our beagle was losing a bit of hair from the back of her neck because most collars are stiff and hard. This great collar has solved the problem and I am sure my dog is happier. It truly is soft and Cozy.,dogs,3
"I bought this for my daughter's dog. He is a hybrid, probably Australian cattle dog and Jack Russell and weighs less than 40 lbs. It took him all of 2 minutes to figure out that he could get the large treat out of the ball by getting one canine tooth under the edge and pulling. The second one came out even faster! The treats themselves did take him about 5-10 minutes to eat. As far as entertainment value and boredom relief while in his kennel? I couldn't even give it to him in the kennel because the ball itself was too easy to chew up once the treats were out of it.Not impressed, not worth the money, doesn't do what it's advertised to do, won't bother ordering more of the treats to fit it as they are quite expensive and I can keep him entertained longer with a Kong or Nyla Bone. Modification in design so the treat doesn't pop out so easily might fix it, but at this point, for the price, don't bother. Waste of 20 bucks.",dogs,3

I have found that it is a very handy item to have! It holds plenty of water, no leaking, and seems quite sturdy. I guess my only complaint (and really not that big of a deal) was the price...I mean, it's not that costly...but I did find one (not the exact same thing but very close) at one of our local pet stores for about $6.",cats,2
"I have a yellow Lab who seems to shed year round. The furminator removes the hair and makes it easy to dispose of as well. I used to use a metal horse comb.

"I bought this item from Amazon to use for my Bichon Frise as a car travel case, While we frequently take him with us, we used the case only a few times to contain him in a safe area. Last evening we brought the Bichon to a small gathering and I put him in the carrier so that I could eat my dinner while he was safe as well as out of the reach of the group. Within 5 minutes I watched as my 7.5 pound dog walked freely among the gathering. He had ripped the screening in one area of the case and ripped out a three cornered piece, gaining his freedom. Fortunately this was a very safe place but I cannot imagine the havoc that could have happened should this have happened anywhere else. It is too late to return the product, all packaging is gone as is the shipping information. The problem has nothing to do with Amazon, I will continue my relationship with them! But I will not purchase anything else from the manufacturer and would advise everyone else to avoid a purchase of this item.",cats,2
"My mother got this for my husband as a birthday gift because he hated cleaning the old litterbox (non-automatic type, he had to take over when I got pregnant). It has been a huge blessing! The cat started using it with no fuss, it requires no special bags and as long as you clean it regularly (a piece of cake!) there is no odor!There is a very low constant hum from the engine, I've heard florescent lights buzz louder. Across the room you can barely hear it, we have it in a back room and never hear it at all. Also, I think some litter got into a nook or cranny somewhere because after the first week it started making an occasional vibrating noise. As soon as I have the baby I'll take the litterbox apart and clean it thoroughly, I'm sure that will take care of it.Overall, we are very thrilled with this gift.",cats,2

Your money will go down the drain, it will defeat the whole purpose in buying it in the first place, and your dog can choke from the stuffing. It's a kute toy. Love it, but don't get it if your dog is an avid chewer like mine. LOL",dogs,3
"I guess I should have checked the dimensions more closely ... I must have always purchased the medium size in the past. This is huge, but works well in the snow for retrieving.

Doesn't work well as a chew toy, as he peels the tennis ball covering off in days.",dogs,3

"How does a company get away with claiming to be the BEST of anything? This is truly NOT the best cat litter. I bought it after given a rebate for a free bag and I'm so glad it was free because I would have returned it anyway. The concept is good; no dust, all natural, safe for septic tanks, no odor. But most of the claims are false and when I read the reviews I was shocked at how many people rated this litter highly. For the most part the odor control is non-existent. The clumping is good but it does resemble corn meal mush and breaks up in tiny pieces when scooped, which takes forever to remove. There is low dust and of course no tracks through the house, but that doesn't make up for the other problems. All in all if you claim to be the ""BEST CAT LITTER IN THE WORLD"", you should at least come close which this product does not do.",cats,2
"I find it easier , less time consuming, and more economical to use standard generic litter with liners than using scoopable litter in multi-cat households. The liners keep the litter box bottom from getting yucky. You do need to keep the nails trimmed on your cat(s) or they will tear up the liner. This happens occasionally anyways but with a quick transfer to a close trash this is not too much of a tragedy.",cats,2

She plays with it by herself--neighbors have seen it sail 10 feet up in the air in the backyard after we've left for work!She also just really likes the chicken, sometimes she'll take it to a quiet place and nap with it.But we love it when she needs a little activity at night and flings, chases and shakes it like she's going to break its neck! It really gets her going! It's got a little bounce to it, it makes a cool noise--and our 45 lb dog is going on one year with this chicken and there is nary a tear or a rip--and best--no shredding--and this is from a dog who can peel tennis balls and un-stuff any stuffed toy.",dogs,3

"I read a review on here that stated that the 315 count Bags On Board are an inch or so smaller. I had forgotten about this and ordered them anyway the second time around. The reviewer had stated something like, it's nice to have the extra length when tying up and keeping your hands away from the dog waste. The reason I want to repeat this review is as a warning. I have three small dogs and the regular size bags can handle all of the 'stuff' so I don't need to replace the bag at each 'event'. With these shorter bags, this is not possible. Who would have though that less than a two inch difference would have such a big impact but it does. The bags are fine and of fine quality like the regular ones in the 120 count. They're just shorter in length. This length, however, is significant.",dogs,3

"The old, small, beige model worked like a tank until the motor died. It was much better than scooping twice a day. I went through about 4 of them in a number of years but the newer model was a disappointment. The newer ones can barely push natural waste and frequently gets stuck halfway through. Littermaid sent me a new motor because I thought I may have bought a dud but the new one was junk, too. I'm out $120 and I'll never buy one again.",cats,2

"We've searched for and tried just about every chew toy for our four year old Golden Retriever and he has torn through everything with ease...until this bone. He's had this toy longer than any other and it's quickly become his favorite. The other good news is that it has not developed any kind of nasty odor like many of the other toys we've tried but has kept a pretty fresh scent to this day (and I know this because he drops it on my lap ten times a day...). As hard as he's worked at it, he has not even been able to rip a tiny piece of the the thin green section off the center of the bone. I highly recommend this bone and just bought two more that should literally last us for the next year or more.",dogs,3
This collar is wonderful! Extremely visible in the dark and it's nice to have the two settings of solid and blinking. Definitely measure your dog's neck first because if you buy a size that's too big than you lose some of the light when cutting it to size. I was going to buy the large but the medium ended up being the perfect size for my dog; I didn't even have to adjust it. Love this collar!,dogs,3
"I would have to say this is my Bichon Frise's favorite toy. She is about 11 lbs, and we got the large. I will say the openings stretched immediately, and the squirrels come out of the holes rather quickly when she puts one in her mouth and walks with it. Nonetheless she LOVES this toy. She will get all three squirrels out quickly and then hang on to either one of the squirrels, or the tree. When I am refilling it she gets EXTREMELY excited and jump around to get it. When I release her to play with it she goes CRAZY for it.I should note that the whiskers were chewed off immediately, so after I noticed the first were off I cut the rest of the whiskers to be safe. Also it is not the most durable toy, but she can be an aggressive chewer if I am not keeping an eye on her. Even though it is missing some of its ""hair"" and its whiskers, I still gave the product 5 stars because like i said Bailey goes crazy for this toy, and has helped us in teaching her fetch and give immensely.",dogs,3
"I have 2 cats at home and have had a Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow in the past, after problems with the pump i switched to the Drinkwell fountain. I did not like it as much - if you have it in a living area (mine was in the kitchen) it is very loud. Also the parts do not go back on as easy after you clean it. Recently, I switched back to the Petmate and am glad I did and think my cat is too! I do not think he was drinking as much from the Drinkwell due to how loud it was. On the Petmate, it seems like they have a new manufacturer for the pump since I owned it last - it is not noisy at all, and so far is easy to clean. I bought the medium size, which is smaller than i owed last time, but only one of my cats uses it, so it seems to be fine.",cats,2

His favorite thing to do is go into an empty bath tub with one of these. He can spend hours in there playing.I highly recommend these. They don't shed, they don't fall apart, they don't break, and they are completely washable!",cats,2

Decided to try this, figuring the cost was very reasonable. Happily she trained quickly and has not left the property in months! We could not be happier. It was fairly easy to set up and the training was not bad at all. Highly recommend, especially since this costs a couple of hundred verses thousands that an inground system can run.",dogs,3

"When necessary, I have used Chlorpheniramine in conjunction with a combination of Hydrocortisone spray and Hydrocortisone shampoo to relieve the symptoms associated with my Miniature Dachshund's flea bite allergy, and this has worked really well for her. Her flea bite allergy also makes her susceptible to flea allergy dermatitis. A dog doesn't have to ""have fleas"" to get flea allergy dermatitis. For dogs who are allergic to flea saliva, only one bite from a single flea can trigger all over itching, scratching, licking, and biting during which the dog damages his or her skin which can then lead to secondary bacterial or yeast infections.

He no longer eats or drinks water, but he's doing good. I purchased the Soft Claws for Cats with the intent of keeping Larry from accumulating the AIDS again. Some of his nails fell off as I applied the Soft Claws for Cats, it might have been because he might have been dead at the moment. I carried on anyway, I don't let small things like that get me down. Details, really. In the end, it didn't work out and I resorted to the sink garbage disposal. My neighbor called the police, but that might have been because I did the whole thing at my ex-husband's house - he has a restraining order against me. Five later, here I am.",cats,2

"Ok so I went and brought the cascade 200 online for my 55 gallon tank. Only because my old filter is too old and doesn't have enough power to run my tank. I been cleaning out my tank every two weeks to every months. This new filter hasn't made the much needed changes to help keep my tank clean. Here are some problems that I have with this filter. 1. The filter is made out of a very breakable blue plastic while my old one is made out of a very hard nonbreakable black plastic. 2. The tube extension is way too small and come off too easily. For a filter being made for a 55 gallon tank it should look like it was made for a 55 gallon tank. 3. The design of the cascade 200 is way too small. I've readed the box and it said for aquariums up to 50/190 gallons/liters. Really? Also it doesn't even fit securly on my tank's legde. It like it was made for ten gallon tank instead but I've readed the box but did the maker read it. 4. The high and low setting on the flow control is unnecessary. You only need high just high setting. Giving a comparison to my old filter with this new cascade filter, my old filter is still better. I've gave this product one star because of the very fast delivery service. You're better off buying your filters from Walmart where you can buy a cheap and well made power filter then buying it online very expension but very cheaply made.",fish aquatic pets,4

(caused puking, muscle spasms) So I clipped the proof of purchase and mailed in my receipt as the guarantee asked. I got a coupon in the mail for a small bag of food! For one, the coupon is for a smaller bag of food. Two, I requested a refund....why would I give the same food to my dog and make him sick?

The customer service for Evo was unhelpful and was not able to help my situation. Apparently it is not a true satisfaction guarantee.",dogs,3

"Got this because my cat wasn't drinking enough water. Found out that cats dislike drinking stale water as in the wild water that has been flowing is usually fresher.My cat wasn't comfortable drinking this the first few days so I left his old bowl next to this fountain. It took him 3 days to get comfortable with it.He's now enjoying it. May sometimes drink directly from the water fall.I'm glad I got this.Downside is that it's hard to clean. I knew this when purchasing it, but was still a good buy.",cats,2
"Cats have always been a part of my life so it follows that I've had to schlep an awful lot of litter as well. Litter is heavy, expensive, and difficult to dispose of. There is no such thing as flushable litter! I have the plumbing bills to attest to that.Then, while fast-forwarding through the commercials on TiVo, I happened to notice an intriguing ad for a new, automatic litter box, the Cat Genie. I was mesmerized, an actual flushing commode for the cats to use. The cats and I watched raptly as the professional actor cat used the box then observed the self-cleaning cycle.This looked like the real deal, but we were skeptical. Two LitterMaids had let us down horribly and we did not want a replay of that experience. After a bit of on-line research, however, Cat Genie was starting to look even more attractive by the minute. I took a chance, I ordered one to check it out.Big surprise, it works! It works exactly as described! The cats are ecstatic. I am ecstatic. As soon as the two additional units arrive, those nasty old litter boxes are going out the door, never to return.We have only two, star-stealing, quibbles with this gadget. The Genie Arm doesn't always get all the droppings at the beginning of the cycle. I find that I need to stand by with a scooper to insure that all that stuff goes into the hopper and does not fall back into the bowl. This is no big deal and is worth the minute it takes. Compare that to the hours each week you can spend carrying home litter, cleaning, scooping, and refilling boxes, and disposing of the mess.The replacement cleaner solution is rather like a printer cartridge in that without one, the unit won't work. They are not refillable either, despite the solution being cheaply available in gallon jugs of concentrate. Doubtless some clever cat lover will soon come up with a way to refill these things, thereby earning the undying love and adoration of cats and their slaves everywhere.Cat Genie is not even very expensive when viewed in perspective. Premium clumping litters or crystals are very expensive and potentially harmful for kitty. Even clay litter can add up quickly if you have more than one or two cats. Disposal is always a problem. Even if this thing ends up costing the same over time in supplies as litter, it cleans itself. That is worth a lot to me!Now all we need is a self-cleaning house....",cats,2
"Unfortunately, it did not correct nuisance barking with my Pomeranian. I'd fill it up before I left, and come home to find it empty. After watching video that I recorded of him while I was gone, the product worked flawlessly, but unfortunately was no phase to my dog.Please do not let this review turn you away from trying the product. It's definitely worth a shot as all dogs are different to responding to things.",dogs,3

"These worked to calm our cat and help to ease his anxiety. Used for several years and would purchase again. Friends and family have tried. It worked for some but not for all.

"I am a breeder and thought this would be a nice toy to send home with my puppies. I gave a few of them to the puppies here and within minutes they had removed the material part.

We have 3 dogs and a cat in our house so hair tends to accumulate and we have spent a small fortune on products that promise to remove pet hair and I always keep coming back to this. It is not a miracle, you do have to pull the hair off the sponge while you work but it does do more then the sticky tape things that you roll once and then have to peel off another layer. I love this product and often use it on those places where my ""babies"" lay around, and leave tons of hair behind.",dogs,3
"I purchased this because Ive been supplementing my dog's diet with coconut oil & thought this might be a good way to change it up. The stuff smells horrible. Like horrible horrible. But the worst part was when my poor dog woke up with hives and a super swollen face. She had a terrible allergic reaction to the Salmon Oil which required an emergency trip to the vet. The poor pooch looked like Mike Tyson. She got a couple of shots and is now sleeping it off, but wow--I would never have guessed something so innocuous could have lead to such a reaction.

"I have two cats. I purchased this because one of my cats fell in love with a mouse video on Animal Planet's Funniest Videos. Ever since then I have been trying to find a dvd with mice on it. I read the reviews for this one and it was part of the 4 for 3 deal so I decided to try it. Well, my cat loves it! He stares at me whenever I wanna watch ""real"" tv and begs me to put his video on. So I usually give in. Now my other cat who doesn't watch much tv doesn't care too much for it. But if your cat loves to watch animals on tv, then they should love this video. I am so glad I got it! Its got birds, mice, frogs, lizards, squirrels, pigeons, ducks, geese, etc., and it lets you choose by animal or just watch the entire dvd. Nice feature. It's got nature sounds, nice clear pictures. It's really cute, even I enjoy watching it. Hope your cat will too!",cats,2
"I got this thinking small was small, but I had no idea this would be TINY. I have seen mice (live) larger than this thing. I'm afraid to let my dog play with it, afraid she'll get it stuck in her throat.When they say small, they mean miniature, microscopic, it's about 1 1/2 inches long...maybe 2, and is just waiting to be swallowed.I'm sorry, but unless you have a dog the size of a guinea pig, don't waste your time.",dogs,3
"I bought this for my cat, and it works great because she was only drinking out of my sink and not her bowl. After buying this, she now drinks out of it more than the sink. The only problem is when I got a puppy and it almost chewed through the cord, and cleans his paws in it. The 70oz Resrvoir is great when I go out overnight because the dog and cat drink a lot. I would suggest buying the whole package, its worth it.",cats,2

"There are good things about this litter box, and less than perfect things. It does scoop well, and the ionizer is a cool addition. On the negative side, the flap that opens the box for the used litter doesn't seem like it fits - it falls off all the time, so odor control is not as good as it could be. Used litter sticks to the bottom too. I would definitely buy this again, but if there was a better made product out there (i.e., where all the pieces stay where they are supposed to), I would choose that first.",cats,2

When it finally wears out, I'll definitely be getting another one.",cats,2

"I got this box as an experiment for use with a type of Pine Pellet litter. For anyone who uses pine pellet litter, we know it does wonders to get rid of tracking issues and smells great, but the urine breaks the pellets down into a soggy and smelly sawdust. I didn't want to buy the Feline Pine sifting box because it lacks a hood. My room mates have dogs who like to go after the ""kitty crunchies"", and having a hood greatly reduces odor and the unwanted sight of your beloved pet taking a deuce in the middle of your apartment's kitchen.Anyway, my thinking was I could fill this with the pellets and sift out the urine soaked sawdust while the pellets remained on top, and scoop the solid waste.Bad idea. The holes are JUST too big to keep the pellets from sifting through. So don't bother if you're thinking this is the miracle solution like I did.So I bit the bullet and bought a Breeze system, which I will be using with the pine pellets instead of the type that comes with it. I'm going to try and jerry rig the hood of this litter box on top of the Breeze which has similar measurements.God help me. God help us all.Update",cats,2
"Our 60lbs Golden Lab was okay on a leash but pulled when excited, the worst heading to the dog park. I friend recommended this product.

She no longer attempts to jump over them, nor does she nudge towards other pedestrians. Great product I would recommend to anyone.",dogs,3
"We have two dogs, and we are disappointed with the performance and the quality of the Premier citronella bark collar. It worked okay with one dog, and not at all on the other. The collar's quality was not what we expected for the price. We returned one because the dispenser on the collar leaked. There was no problem with the return, but the replacement leaked after a while also. The collar is made of nylon with the usual catch. However, it has a flimsy adjustment piece that easily becomes unadjusted, making it useless. We liked the safety concept despite the cloud of citronella created when our one dog was intelligent enough to outsmart the 20 spray maximum. We had to recharge the dispenser several times during the training period. Despite its safety, we are disatisfied enough to warn others that this product is not worth a fraction of what it costs.",dogs,3

"I chose this specific sand because of several factors. The price was comparable to other sands and gravel (minus play sand, of course). It claimed to come packed with live, good bacteria to help with cycling. It requires no rinsing. It buffers the pH, and it's an attractive sand.After reading all that, I thought it would be the perfect choice. Both processes of rinsing sand and cycling tanks are not things that I ever look forward to, so I was very excited when I found this sand.The tank has been set up (with sand) for a month now. Initially, the tank was quite cloudy for maybe five days - with an old filter running on it. The claim ""doesn't need rinsing"" led me (and probably many others) to believe that the product wouldn't create a cloud-fest in your tank.The live bacteria claim is a joke. The tank still isn't fully cycled. I should have remembered that the bacteria requires aeration and a source of ammonia to stay alive, or at least refrigeration. Not going to get much of that packed in a water-tight bag.The pH level is fine, but I can't say for certain that it's the sand doing it. I have tufa rock in the tank as well, and I've heard that water in my area is naturally higher in pH.The sand does look nice, and after the tank is established, it's not a bad product. The few mbuna that I have in there now love digging out pits between and under rocks. But the product's initial claims are a little far-fetched.",fish aquatic pets,4

The container is not large enough to fit replacement bags without tremendous hassle and frustration. I have only been successful two times placing replacement bags in the container. The other four times I tried I was not successful and the bags came unrolled as I tryed to stuff them in. It is not easy to place the bags in the container and thread the beginning of the bags through the hole in the dispenser. I hate this container and I am looking to buy something else. I do like the hands free concept of being able to walk and not hold poop bags in my hand. I just want a dispenser big enough to hold replacement bags/rolls with ease. I rate it a one because I thought the bone shaped dispenser was really cute.,dogs,3

I am not sure which one of the two cats caused the mess, but we began to see soiled wet litter on the outside of the unit.

"After two courses of antibiotics and contemplating a third, I tried Animal Essentials Plant Enzymes & Probiotics. After a few weeks of using the product my GSD's skin has cleared. I have a one-year-old all black german shepherd who continued to have a staph-like (Vet diagnosed) skin infections covering much of his body. My GSD would take the antibiotics and his skin would clear up for a couple weeks then become red, irritated and scaly/scabby again. My family and me have always used probiotics for ourselves, especially after taking a course of antibiotics. Continued courses of antibiotics for people and animals can wreak havoc on the immune system. Antibiotics upset the natural balance of good flora (bacteria) in the intestines causing a decrease in an animal's immune system which can lead to yeast overgrowth. As a result, the pet may have eye discharge, skin problems, loose stools, etc. I believe this product brings a natural balance back to the intestines and heals many of these conditions. My GSD's fur is shiny once again, skin is clear, and bald patches have disappeared. Thank you for an excellent product!",cats,2

"I love this carrier. It has a soft covering on top of a solid bottom. Three of the four sides are a strong, rubbery mesh which keeps kitty in. Both the top and one side open for easy access (definitely good when the occupant doesn't want to go in or out) and the other side has a pocket that you could stick little things in if you wished. Has both carrying handles and a shoulder strap to carry with. The sides are sturdy and the fabric is durable. My only complaint is that it is a bit small. I know I could have bought the next size up, so it is partly my fault.. I did measure and weigh my cat though to ensure that she met the standards. Although she was close to exceeding the size the guidelines, I thought it would be okay. She fits okay as long as she just hangs out and lays down (she can turn around if she tries). If in doubt and your pet is on the edge of the size guidelines, I would suggest moving up to the next size.",cats,2

"Urgh. I had so much hope that something would control fleas this year. In past years we have had no to little problems with fleas. A mild winter has changed that. I just used the third dose of Frontline on our three dogs...having read it takes two to three months to build up and really work. Well, the fleas are worse this month than in June! So Frontline just does not work anymore. I am also feeding dogs vitamin B1, brewers yeast, and sprayed the house with Home Defense insecticide. this product is 1/2 strength of commercial pesticides so if you spray twice, it works as effectively.

I guess I need to reapply even though it claims it works for 12 months.A friend uses Trifexis on her dogs for heartworms and fleas and doesn't have any problems.

I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this item for my 8 year old beagle. My dog has been tied up for several years and finally I realized he needed more exercise and freedom. My dog has never been trained or really even worked with; but it was very easy to train him to use this wonderful fence. Everyone that knew my dog thought this fence would never work for him; but he has not left the yard one time since we have been using the fence. He's only been fully trained for about 6 weeks; but it seems like forever because it works very well to keep him inside the yard. The only downside is I should have worked with him a little more while the flags were up (we had a lot of snow and it made the flags harder for him to see#. He doesn't necessarily go by the flag boundaries #long gone now# but he created his own boudaries like the side of the house or the side of the deck which is probably my fault for training him in the snow where it was hard for him to utilize the flags appropriately. I was very very afraid to trust my dog to let him loose but this system works wonderful. The install was a little hard #1 acre yard) but that was just because my husband isn't the handiest man-but overall it was pretty simple.Our only regret we should have done it sooner. If we ever move we will install a SportDOG fence there as well. The untrainable dog has now been trained.Update 7/13/2010 still a great product and the dog has still never left the yard. WONDERFUL!!!!!,cats,2
"My cat loves these. The cutouts make it easy for her to carry around in her mouth and she prefers this jingle tone over other jingle bells. They have a smooth surface so they roll easily for when she chases them around on hardwood floors and carpet. They're very durable too, I can chuck them across the room without worrying that they will break open. I have not been able to find these at major pet stores anymore so I bought different kinds of other jingle balls but my kitty loves these the best.

If given a chance my kitty will sneak into the closet, take the lid off the box, and dig out these specific balls - she loves them that much.",cats,2

"While we desperately love our cat, we have become sleep deprived. She wakes us up earlier and earlier begging to be fed. On top of that, we went away for the weekend and she ate more than double the amount of food she should have. It was time to do something. I read reviews of this product and was worried about purchasing it, but I had to give it a try. I took it home yesterday, spent about 1 minute programming it and filled it up. My husband was going to set his alarm clock, the first time in years, but I told him there was no way it would work the first day. Sure enough, he was late for work this morning. I realize that I haven't owned the product long enough to write a full review, but I wanted to help people worrying about the programming. Apparently, they have have revised their instructions. There was nothing to it. The lid was another concern, but it does snap on. The food hopper has two notches on the side, so I set it the base and twisted it a bit. It seems to be securely in place. I will update my review after owning the product longer. So far, it's fantastic! UPDATE",cats,2
"I had very low expectations for the Pet Bistro because of some of the reviews I'd read. Much to my surprise it was SUPER EASY to program. It took less than 5 minutes to unbox, load batteries, set the current time, program for 3 feedings, and load food into the hopper. Now Monty gets 3 1/4 cup feedings per day (instead of only two feedings with much larger quantities) and he's eating smaller portions. Hopefully he'll lose weight and become a leaner healthier cat with the help of the Pet Bistro. I love the Pet Bistro because I no longer have to worry about rushing home for feedings and the portion sizes are perfectly measured. Monty has adapted nicely to the change in his feeding routine.",cats,2

"Assembly and cleaning is not that difficult if you just follow the manual. The manual even has directions for cleaning the pump. The product does get noisy if the water level is low, but to fix that all you have to do is get a glass full of water and pour it into the bowl part of the product, which I do about once a day. This takes maybe five seconds and is just as easy as filling a regular bowl, only the water gets filtered through and is always clean and debris free. The other thing to do about noise is to lift the dome and slide a finger along the pump to clear away any hairs and debris that may have gotten by the carbon filter. Again, about 5 seconds of work. As for getting the water to flow over the entire dome, I've found that adding extra water to the bowl after replacing the dome along with rubbing your hands over the dome helps a lot. If you do these things this product should work just fine. I have had mine for three months, clean it once a week, and have had no problem with spilling, parts breaking, or my cats not liking it. Just as with anything though, you need to take care of it, but that part is relatively simple.",cats,2

"And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.",dogs,3
"In hindsight I wish I had opted for the larger model, even though my two kitties aren't exactly giants. When I see them use it, they appear a little cramped - maybe it's my imagination...

"The citronella bark collar seems to work, so far. But so did the Innotek when I first put it on our Jack Russell, but she learned to ignore the tingle. The one drawback I see with this product is it is not weather proof, there is no cap to cover the refill nozzle and the battery is not protected from moisture or dirt. This will be a problem since our girl, Dot, is an outdoor dog and she will fill it with dirt and mud. Plus it appears that the unit will need frequent refilling.UPDATE:According to the Amazon description, the collar has been discontinued.After initial success, Dot now barks once then quickly turns her head to avoid the spray. She continues to do so until the reservoir is empty, then continues on with her barking.The enclosed battery lasted less than a month and when I replaced it, sure enough, the compartment was full of dirt.Score",dogs,3
"I looked and looked and looked for a travel kennel that would be tall enough for our Great Dane. They're hard to come by! Hauling his wire kennel with us just isn't feasible - it's huge. This was plenty tall and easy to set up (once we realized the poles are in a pouch in the bottom). I like that he can see what's going on outside the kennel (unlike some that just have a small mesh window). The first time we used it, we took our dog to a friend's cabin. It did the job. He did try to dig his way out of the front and there's a little wear and tear. I could see where that would be a problem if your dog really wanted out - but no travel kennel is going to withstand a dog with separation anxiety or severe boredom.I'm really glad we got it - this is a life-saver!",dogs,3
"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training. We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark). They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry. We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors. Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We usePro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce).Our dog loves all flavors.",dogs,3

"This was hyped to be so great at growing hair especially in areas of hair loss/ shedding.This was not my experience. The product itself is nice enough, though the actual amount of product was less than I expected. I bought the small size because I only intended to try it over my small problem area. It smells great! texture is good, it will not goo up your hair, however, it just did nothing for me in terms of hair growth. I exercise daily, eat healthily, and have just a small area to the right temple that had thinned a bit. Other wise my hair is healthy and very thick and curly. I got no change, I tried it on other areas too, just in case that particular area was beyond help.I cannot say it made a difference for me at all, I even tried the method of mixing with JBCO before applying.Doesn't make my hair grow... but, as I said, it smells nice and does not leave residue.",cats,2

"I know that my 1 year old bulldog is an extreme chewer, so I bought him this toy. I had read the reviews about the middle part being chewed off, but I didn't think that my dog would or could chew off the middle part, especially since he had different nylabones before and he loved chewing the part he was SUPPOSED to chew.

It doesn't let water in and withstands my corgi's powerful bite. He's a monster that can chew through anything. My collie beats her collar to death when she itches and hasn't been able to budge this thing. The paint chips off after time, but I didn't get it for looks, I got it to keep her info safe. It doesn't get in her way, the size is wonderful, and it dangles low enough to be seen through her fur. I'd recommend this product and have many times. I wish it could be glow-in-the-dark in a way that the paint couldn't chip off. That would be neat since I have a tri-color collie and it's hard to spot her tags sometimes.",cats,2
"I ordered the pink/polka dot version for my very large Dogue De Bordeaux (French Mastiff, 90lbs). The jacket was promptly shipped and arrived at my house in less than a week, I think it was only 3 days - just in time for her 1st birthday party.I was very pleased with the fit, the jacket velcros securely around her deep chest and buckles for added safety. The front portion fastens the same manner. Both can be adjusted very easily for different body shapes without compromising the fit.I was intially concerned the jacket seemed thin, but Kiwi has used it many times now and it helps her float very well. She never has minded running around, swimming and hanging out in the jacket, so I assume it's comfortable for her to wear.Overall, very, very pleased with Paws Aboard Designer Life Jacket - Polka Dot.",dogs,3
"Our 14-year old cat used to be a super-athlete, but recently started hesitating to jump and developed a mild limp in her front leg. Vet recommended trying Cosequin for Cats to see if joint function improved; it took a while (2-3 weeks) but now she jumps easily. Doubt she'll ever go back to climbing trees and shimmying down the 2nd story deck columns, but it's nice to see her more active. While she still has a bit of a limp which we'll need to work on more with the vet, Cosequin certainly helps -and being able to get it at less than half the price from Amazon makes it just that much easier.EDIT 4/8/2012",cats,2

I wish they were just a bit softer though for our small dogs (chihuahuas) as they seem somewhat dry right out of the bag.

The dogs (a 15 lb mixed breed and a 40 lb Pit Bull puppy) are calm when they travel now and remain in the back of seat of my truck throughout any ride. I believe the hammock has made the dogs calm during the ride, because they feel comfortable and more secure. I would absolutely recommend this item, as it is does what it is designed to do (keeping dogs in the back and your seats clean), and is very easy to install (there are 4 adjustable straps that slide over the headrests). Also, I find it useful for grocery shopping (which is a pain in a truck) or transporting other items, because it keeps things from rolling around and ending up wedged under the seats.

She gets so engrossed with it, it's great to pass the time when she's bored. when she chews it holds up really well. I myself love this fetching toy/treat/chew toy. Would definetly recommend to anyone.",dogs,3

"Considering I've only had Purigen in two filters for less than 48 hours, this review may be too early.However, based on what I've observed so far, I think it may be of some help to others for me to let you know my initial impression.First, there's no filter media on the market that's like it. Purigen is made up of millions of tiny synthetic macro resin absorbent. These absorbents act as lock in sponges in the removal nitrogenous waste.Nitrogenous waste is the waste material from fish and plants that , along with uneaten food left to decompose is the cause enemy # 1 - ammonia. Purigen does more than remove ammonia, it also removes soluble and insoluble impurities from the water at rate of 500% more than any other product on the market.It also increase the Redox Potential in your aquarium. I had to research this, but in a nut shell - Redox is the loss of a molecule or atom to gain another molecule or atomWhen this happens essential minerals can't be absorbed by the fish, their immune system can be compromised making them more susceptible to disease. Redox Potential is not only a critically important part of keeping healthy water parameters and equally healthy fish - but something that's almost entirely overlooked by hobbyists.Purigen encourage a healthy and balanced Redox Potential in aquariums which helps maintain richer oxygen levels and fend off disease. I chose to try Purigen out in a tank with hazy water, it gets direct sunlight so this has always been a problem. The Purigen itself is like a soft fine powder. I can see why you need to use such a fine mesh media bag of at least 180. The Seachem media bag won't break down, has welded seams and a plastic snap around tie to prevent it from opening under water pressure.(make sure you fill the bag over a sink, that stuff can blow out everywhere)You know when your replacing media or adjusting something inside a canister filter, turn it back on and all the debris that's been stirred up blasts into your tank? Well, that's exactly what happened, I thought I would do a 50% water change and siphon the gravel. But was pressed for time. I return home an hour later and the water is completely clean - and I don't mean just clean but pristine and sparkling.Back in 2010 after I bought my first UV sterilizer, I posted about it here on Amazon. I was amazed at how in 24 hours the water had become so beautifully clear. That was nothing compared to this, it was as if I had my Diatom XL running for 48 hours straight. The water is so absolutely crystal - it's almost surreal. Considering Purigen can be regenerated over and over it's economical to boot.After six months if it's turned a dark brown you soak the entire bag in a 1;1 solution of bleach and water and it returns to it's original state. You rinse it well, soak it in water treated with Prime and you're good to go for another six months. I'm more than incredibly impressed with Purigen and have already ordered more - it's going into every filter we have.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I think these are a great idea - hiding pills inside a tasty little ball of gooey chicken tasting stuff. Because I could get them with free shipping via Amazon's Supersaver shipping (for orders over $25) I decided to try them. We have two indoor house cats and two outdoor barn cats, and I worm them quarterly. Usually I have to grind up their pills and hide the powder in wet food. I tried liquid wormer but they could smell it in the food and wouldn't eat it.So, the Greenies arrived and I fixed one for each cat. One cat smelled it a long time, but wouldn't eat it despite my pleading. Two of them gave the Greenie a quick sniff and backed away after giving me a dirty look. The fourth cat actually hissed at me when I offered it to her. She's not the friendliest cat to begin with, but she usually takes treats from my hand. The overall opinion from the cats seems to be ""yeah, right! Nice try!""Maybe the salmon flavor would be a better choice, but I don't think I'll spend the money to find out. I'm giving three stars because it's a great idea, but if the cats won't eat them I'm back to the drawing board.",cats,2
"We have used, or rather our cat has used, the Littermaid automatic litter box for several years now. It has proven reliable, easy to clean and maintain. Kitty has not had any problems using it either. In my opinion the replaceable plastic bins beat the heck out of flimsy plastic bag box liners, making the task of cleaning the litter box as clean and easy as possible under the circumstances. I recommend buying the 18-count refill trays as this is more economical and last longer. Kitty gets about one week of use out of each tray.",dogs,3

As they got older, incontinent and a wee bit senile we needed to find a way to keep the dogs and the house safe when we couldn't be there. These crates were the perfect solution.1) Super easy to fold, and lays down flat, no hardware needed... vacations have been much less stressful with this crate. It fits perfectly in the car folded up. I no longer worry about messes in hotels of the homes of friends and family.2) The molded bottom cleans up quick and easy.3) The size of these crates are amazing. My lab/dalmation mix has room to walk a few steps, turn around, have room for a small water bowl and her bed and still leave a sizeable area of the crate floor clear just in case she needs to go. If she has an accident she still has a clean spot on her bed to retreat to. When i get home I only have to clean the crate bottom, not the crate AND the dog.4) We also used this crate with the divider when a friend with little dogs visited. Each dog got one side of the crate and it's own door and had plenty of room.Definitely recommend!",dogs,3

"I have a dog that at times could not be comforted especially during the night . I took her to the vet and we tried medication. That did not work at all.

"The pump broke within 2 weeks and I haven't been able to find a replacement. It would be under warranty but I threw away the paperwork (my bad) because usually I keep everything and then it just clutters up and I never have a problem. However, I still think the product should last a little longer than that! I purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although I had tossed the box, etc.",cats,2
"I thought product was very good. However, my doggie had destroyed the entire filler for this bedding within 20 minutes of introdoucing it to her. I don't know if the filler had something in it that disturbed her and she felt need to destroy. Bed was delivered at 3 pm and at 3:30 when I checked to see how she was reacting, the entire filler had been shredded to bits. Maybe it was some odor which she didn't like but you should check this out. Unfortunantely, I felt need to find another home for her at this point.",dogs,3

We have been using this harness for our 80 pound lab for the past 3 years. It's been the only thing that has worked for us with his pulling. It makes sense since the leash connects on the chest instead of some harnesses that connect on the back allowing the dog more leverage to pull. Our former dog walker loved it so much she recommended it to her other clients. Many of our dog friends bought one too after seeing how well it worked for our zealous lab. A couple of pointers I thought were helpful,dogs,3
"My husband and I just returned from dog shows where we had two 7 month old Scottish Terrier pups housed in these crates. The crates are very lightweight, sturdy, with lots of windowscreens for air to flow through and the windowscreens are tinted for heat resistance. They load easy, repel and hide dirt, are easy to wipe out the bottoms off (as one has a tendency toward carsickness). Friends have expressed concern over dogs chewing up the soft crates, but so far the pups have not destroyed the fabric, windows, framing or bottoms. They sleep, rest, travel and eat in these crates.

"Kills fleas, ticks and makes my dog smell good!!!That said, it's not a hundred percent effective and I have to practically douse my German Shepperd in it but it does the job just fine (just be sure to let it soak in for a bit to kill those extra healthy bugs).Keep in mind that you'll also have to wash all your pets bedding and toys if you want the bugs to stay away for any length of time.",dogs,3
"I don't review many things, but this one I felt compelled. In the past, I've had two german shepherds and now I have a 75lb 3-year old mutt who grew way too fast. We started with regular ""x-large"" dog beds, but by the time she was two, she looked like a giant on a tiny bed - head and feet always flopping over the sides.This bed is HUGE! She fits comfortably, even large enough for her to bring her ""friends"" in and sleep with her. The height & firmness of the bolster is perfect for her big ol head and she loves being on her bed more than anything! She was in it before we could even get it out of the box, and we've easily trained her that that's home-base during meal times and when she gets her snack.Last thing",dogs,3
"We purchased this pet bed for our german shepherd. It fits the crate nicely, but is not quite as plush as I would have thought. Also, the bolster is not as big as I initially thought it would be. Our dog likes to prop his head up and he folds the bed in half to have the elevation he wants for resting. All in all the pet bed is okay for the price.",dogs,3
"My 1 y/o little rescue had his teeth cleaned at the same time he was neutered. His teeth were/are very good, but figured, get it done when the opportunity presented.Within six months, his breath started getting 'fishy' again. Although I do brush his teeth, I'm not that diligent. More like weekly, not daily.This spray has done the trick. It took a few weeks, but fresh as a daisy now. I've used it twice a day, but think I'll roll back to maintenance mode. I spray it right on his tongue. I was spraying it in the sides of his mouth, but think that might have been a bit harsh on gums.I've been told that small dogs lose their teeth more than any others. Makes sense, because the tooth surface is so small, it can be overcome by plaque, and hence gum disease, much faster.Some are nervous about the alcohol in it, but the 'dose' is so small, I don't think it's a problem. I think of it as doggie Listerine. It contains grape seed oil, too. Look it up, no problem.Yes, it's not cheap; but would you rather pay hundreds for cleanings (and our vet also includes pre-op blood work before surgery), and expose your dog to anesthesia unnecessarily? Not if I can help it!",cats,2
Hi we have a pug who has very sensitive skin due to a grain allergy. I found that this product does not cause our dog's skin or ears to get hot or red after bathing. The company confirmed for me that their products are grain free. I also noted that it did not seem to hurt his eyes. I highly recommend this product. Most hypo-allergenic products do not leave the dogs fur feeling fluffy and soft but this shampoo does and is safe for our grain free pug.,cats,2

Terrific product if you need to medicate a cat and want a hassel and/or stress free way for both the cat and you.

The only issue i have is now when i rains i have to make sure to lock it closed or else my house becomes muddy. A huge issue if it rains while im at work.

"I read the reviews before I got this and, despite all the positives, was still a little skeptical. After all, it's basically a piece of cardboard with some catnip rubbed in, right? WRONG! I've only had this thing one day and my 5 kitties will NOT leave it alone. I've ordered 3 more of them.I'm not sure what it is about this particular toy or catnip, but my kitties have never reacted to anything like this before. I keep catnip around and, of course, the little darlings are very fond of it. I'm also fond of it because it provides me with hours of amusement watching them get silly. I also keep scratchy toys around (the old round cardboard-surrounded-by-ball thing, sisal, furniture - the usual stuff) and a basketful of every kind of cute kitty plaything you could think of, even though they tend to prefer shoestrings, my paintbrushes, socks, scraps of paper...*sigh* Anyway, my kitties are not deprived, believe me. So I was surprised at the way they pounced on this scratchy. One of them has been sleeping on it (he drools, so we're dealing with a large wet spot on the end of it at the moment) and even my sweet developmentally challenged baby has taken to digging and rolling on it (once he figured out what it was and how it was used.)Fortunately they're being well-behaved and are managing to share until the other scratchies get here. The little toy that came with it (can't wait to get more of those) has also made the rounds and has been well-rubbed and well-chewed, batted around by everybody, dropped in the water dish, etc., while their usual toys (my furniture is so grateful!) are being neglected. I'm sure this will change once one of them hides the toy in a ""safe"" place and then immediately forgets where it is, but for now it's certainly getting a workout.My point is",cats,2

"I have been using this box for a few months now and the large size works just fine for my two kitties. It is simple to use and really helps eliminate litter spills and odour. I'm surprised to see some people have been having a problem with this box. Just make sure the latches are locked on properly and roll the box over carefully as well. I am using World's best cat litter and the combination works great. There is no litter sticking to the roof of the box when I roll it over.. I don't know how that can happen if you roll the box over carefully. Also, don't overfill the box with litter. This box works best with moderate to low amount of litter.I highly recommend this product. My husband who was repulsed by the idea of changing litter now does it everyday..without me having to ask him!",cats,2
"This brush is well made with a nice handle that is easy to hold. I have a rather long-haired cat who's coat is a mess and he hates when I try to comb or brush him. I have other ""grooming tools"" but I haven't had any luck with them on his coat. This new brush has sturdy pins with rounded tips and the length of the ""pins"" is good for a longer coat. My cat looked suspiciously at the new brush, but I started with long soft strokes and so far he hasn't tried to run away. I think with time he will come to enjoy the brushing with this brush, I like it and hopefully so will my cat !",cats,2
"We live in New York City and have two cats - younger cats, 18 months and about a year old - needless to say, it would be really nice if we could rid ourselves of the litter box forever. We had originally purchased a cat toilet-training system from another company - it was not nearly as good as this one, in fact, it was a total failure - flimsy plastic, and you couldn't punch out the insert gradually like you can this one. At this point we are almost there - we have punched out about half of the insert, and the cats are acually perching on the toilet seat and aiming for the hole - just incredible. We are very happy! The plastic is strong and easy to clean -",cats,2

"I got this for my fluval 306 and it fits perfect . it comes with 4 black suction cups , 2 dark plastic tubes that are aprox 15"" each , a black rubber fitting to assemble the 2 tubes togeather . One of the tubes has one end capped off . I realy do not understand all the neg reviews on lack of instructions as it it childs play to assemble . You have 2 options here , assemble the the 2 tubes togeather with the included black rubber fitting ,( or use just one if you wish) then insert the 4 plastic C looking pieces into the suction cup ends , attach the suction cups to the spray bar and mount to the back of the aquarium just a little below the water line of if you prefer above the water line , it is up to you . Now remove the plastic output nozzle from the canister filter leaving the rubber adaptor connector on the ribbed hose side and connect to the spraybar open end . NOT all that hard folks and those giving the product a bad review just because of a lack of instructions I gotta wonder about.I did drill my holes a little bigger using a standard drill and a bit and it worked out fine . I mounted mine just a little below the water line with the flow pointing driectly foward to the front of the aquarium. This gives me a nice ripple effect on the surface of the water , disperses the flow across all of my 55 gal tank , and the plants gently sway in the flow .

"I have to say first, it was extremely fast shipping. I was told it would be here in a week and it came in only two days.. thankfully. My cats came into contact with another I had staying in the house for a while and I gave them a de-wormer that was supposed to be good. Although it seemed it had gotten rid of them.. I gave it to them as much as it said, but recently they started coming back. So finding a brand that is said to be as good as a Vet, which I couldn't afford to go to, I decided to try it. It's -very- hard to give them this tablet. I ended up crushing it and using a syringe because they would not touch it even ground up into their food. It's been almost a week now and still no sign. I'll give it a higher rating once I know they're gone for good.Edit",cats,2

"I have had this product for well over a month, and it still works great, so just be aware that the other reviewers might have had faulty products and just needed a return. Maybe their dogs are a little crazy and rough house the collar a bit too much. It is a relatively durable case, but I believe that strong impacts would do some damage to the unit. Some good and bad points now:- The spray is VERY effective for curbing barking- Is not sensitive enough for small barks and whining, so this does not solve those problems. If your dog is smart and figures out that quiet barking is not punished (like mine did), you'll still have a problem barker, but just not as loud.- My dog is not afraid of the collar, but knows to be quiet when it is on- Make sure you say 'no barking' or 'quiet' every time it sprays if you can. The dog will learn your command as well.Overall I highly recommend this product for $40. However I do NOT recommend it if you bought it at the $100 that Petsmart wants to steal out of you (though I do love that company). It is simply not a $100 value anti-bark system, more like $40-$50.",dogs,3

After treatments we tried to put him back on Angel Eyes for the tear stains. He refused to eat it. I left his food down with Angel Eyes sprinkled on it for over 1 day, he would not touch it. I decided to put down a different bowl w/no Angel Eyes and he ate it so fast. We have tried several times to get him to eat it, but he Will NOT touch it! I have heard great things about Angel Eyes, but for some reason, my dog must think it tastes bad. We bought the beef flavor, I understand there is a chicken flavor, but not willing to try it now.

But this toy can keep her entertained for an hour or more. I just keep putting those little squeaky squirrels in, and she loves taking them out one by one. Has recently learned to just tip it over and give a head shake, and I think she knows that's cheating. Sometimes I substitute a tennis ball inside, which can exit from the side holes but not the top hole. Compared to all the other squeaker toys, this one is the most fun for all of us.",dogs,3
I bought this for my 1 year old Pointer pup a few months before Christmas and just the other day she punctured it. It's a great ball! It took about 2 days for her to really get used to it and get the idea that when she pushes it she is rewarded. She now gets kibble in it before I leave for work and as snacks during the day. All I have to ask is &#34;Where's your ball&#34; and she'll go to wherever she left it last and brings it rightover. She's also learned to toss it in my lap if I'm not paying attention to her. I bought one for her sister and one for my daughters cat... (the small version) both love it! It has a nice scent to it too... it lasts a long time. It doesnt smell like a plastic toy or the food you put in it. It's rather pleasent. I highly recommend it!,dogs,3

My dogs are about 13 pounds apiece, and one stick per dog lasts at least one full day.

As long as this product stays as reasonably priced as it is now, I'll keep buying them.",dogs,3
"I bought this filter for my betta's 5 gal tank. It's super quiet at the lowest setting and I can barely hear it. I actually sleep right next to it because it's on my desk and it doesn't bother me at all. In Toothless's tank there is gravel and 2 plants, a hornwort and wisteria. The wisteria is closest to the filter, right in front of it, and even at such a close proximity and with the filter at low power the current that the filter creates is still pretty strong. I placed the filter so that the outflow hits the front wall of glass, instead of letting it flow lengthwise across the tank, and it's also near the bottom; that seemed to do the trick. Hopefully Toothless loves his new home and the current isn't so strong that he can't build his bubble nest.",fish aquatic pets,4

No bugs (or mice!) to be seen, I don't think they even know there's dog food in there.I *was* having a problem opening the Vittles Vault; I'd try to unscrew the lid, but the container would slide on the floor in the direction I was turning, so I'd have to try to brace the container with my feet while turning the lid.... it was kind of a hassle. Turns out I was overtightening the lid when closing the Vittles Vault. The manufacturer says to just spin the lid, and when it stops, it's closed. Oh. Well. Boy, is my face red. Now it's much easier for me to open the lid, and it still keeps out ants.The 1 1/4 cup measurement scoop that's included is the perfect size for a daily ration for my 30 lb sheltie. I feed her a small-sized kibble (Canidae All Life Stages), and this container fits the 40 lb bag with a little room left over.

It is approx. tennis ball sized and good for playing catch. I don't ever use the treat holes but it is a neat feature.

Either our Bissell PROHeat 2X shampooer needs a good cleaning, or this stuff doesn't work as well as I thought it would. Its been approximately 3 weeks since I cleaned the carpets, and the places where Cocoa used the bathroom (urine stains) are coming back. I also still smell an odor, but it is nowhere like it was using other carpet cleaners.To be fair, our Bissell was not picking up the water as well as it usually does, so I'm going to do a thorough cleaning of it and see if that may be the problem. But I gave it a good cleaning approximately 3 months ago and have only used it 2 times since, first at my Mom's when my Great-Aunt had an accident (but at 87, she's entitled to an accident every now and then), and when I received this Simple Solution and used it on our carpet. I also clean the Bissell very well after (and during) use.Bottom line, Simple Solution seems to work on odors pretty good, but the stains are returning. I'll do a follow up review once I figure out what's going on with our Bissell deep cleaner, which has been an excellent machine for over 2 years now. If it was the machine not suctioning up the water as it should, I'll let you know. Either way, for the money, its certainly worth a try for stained and smelly carpets.",cats,2
I have been using these heated buckets for a few years now for our outside dogs. It is nice to know that they will always have water to drink no matter how cold it is. Previously I had 2 of the 10 quart size buckets and they worked well for approx. 3 winters. One developed a split in the bottom and the other one quit heating as well and ice would form when the temps hit the mid to low 20's. We only used them from late November thru late Feb to early March and then stored them the rest of the year. Again they save a lot of trouble of frequently replacing frozen water buckets to the pets and give you peace of mind that your animals will always have water. I was just disappointed in only getting 3 winters out of the first buckets we bought.,cats,2

"This is the greatest thing ever invented. The first time we put it on our dog, he barked, got sprayed and then looked around like, ""what's going on??"". He tried again, and same thing. Wow! He stopped barking. Even when he really wants to bark, he only lets out one quiet little bark and then decides it isn't worth it. He does seem to know that he can bark when it is not on him, but even then, it has definitely cut down on the barking. As soon as he sees me pick it up, he stops. One downfall is that if you happen to be near your dog and yell, you may get sprayed, but it isn't too bad. We have only had to refill it once, and that is only because one of our son's friends decided to try it on to see how it worked so of course my son and the other kids started barking so it sprayed the kid til it ran out of spray. Kind of funny....",dogs,3
"We needed a supportive bed for an old dog previously moaning and groaning while sleeping on the floor at night. This is a great price for a thick, sturdy, comfortable ORTHOPEDIC dog bed. Our dog seems to like her bed, and we don't hear her at night anymore. It's a good buy.",dogs,3

"This works decently as a litter deodorizer--not remarkably better than anything else I've tried, but it does mask poopy smells.

"We got the Full Body & Paw Bath Wipes and they really do have a very nice clean pleasant smell. Even Charlie doesn't mind! And I love that they are enriched with lanolin to replenish your dog's coat. They are ideal for dealing with sensitive skin, and they are pre-moistened which allows them to be soft and gentle while cleaning delicate areas such as between the toes and around the tail. And I can tell you Charlie is very sensitve about his butt area! That little nubby tail will go down in a heartbeat to try and protect that little butt!John Paul Pet provides pet care with a salon pedigree.

They are truly the first wipes that have actually helped with the doggie odor and not just hide it for a few minutes and then come back full force! It really helped me so that Charlie did not have to keep having so many baths like he used to. So, that is a big plus for me!Here he is a happy camper after one of the Full Body Wipes and what we called his ""Wiped Down Bath"".",dogs,3

I wasted an hour going out and buying the drill bits and when, today (Sunday), I take the wrap off the door to begin installation, the instruction manual says that I will need 1/4 inch and 9/64 inch drill bits!!! Not the 1/8 inch and 7/32 inch drill bits as stated on the outer label of the package! Not only that but the 7/64 inch drill bit that is supposed to be included was left out and so did not come with the rest of the door components. What kind of ""quality product"" is this?",cats,2

And don't forget this one, so easy to CLEAN too! Look no more if you need a dog crate/pen for small dogs or puppies. It's open on the top so that puppies don't feel like they are trapped in a cage. Our children go in and out of the crate to greet and play with the puppies. Even I can do it too! We take this crate everywhere we go. The assembly takes only 10 seconds to put it up! And it's portable size that you can put in the trunk and go! I even flew jet blue with our puppies and the crate.

"We use our leashes several times a day for our dogs and they last for years. The nylon cord is very durable and we have never had one wear through or break. Eventually, after many thousands of extensions and retractions, the spring might break inside like ours did. If you felt inclined to repair it yourself or send it off for repair, you could probably do it. We opted to buy new ones and have no complaints. I have seen imitations, but the snap and overall construction looked inferior, so be sure you are getting a Flexi and you won't regret it.",dogs,3

I ordered directly from Amazon and not a third-party seller and received the correct product & would advise others to do the same.",cats,2

I have three now and find them to be very easy to clean (the floor pan slides right out) and secure.I am rescuing stray cats and housing them in the crates. I have the 30""L x 19""W x 21""H, which is just big enough for one cat; a larger size would be even better, if one has the room for it (I do not). I keep the cats crated while I am at work in order to keep them safe and let them out when I am home. This product is an outstanding value for the price; it really works.",dogs,3
"We have had this product for a week now and it has completely changed our lives! I have a 3 year old boxer/beagle mix that I've had since he was 8 weeks old and who would constantly bark and lunge for the door anytime someone would come to it. The first day, he would bark and it would spray and scare the mess out of him! Day two, he was a lot more calm. By day five, he only does a low growl. I even took him to the vet to have his nails clipped, and what would typically be a crazy time of barking and pulling, turned into a pleasant experience. No barking or pulling! Same thing with our walks. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because it is sensitive. Sometimes a low growl will set it off. I take it off of him at night so he can relax or during play time because it will go off when he's barking at his toys. Overall I am very satisfied with this and it's so much better than a shock collar. He seems like a completely different, calm, lovable dog! I just hope the training lasts and he will be able to not bark or lunge when the collar is off!",dogs,3

She asked me what I was using to brush my pup - I proudly told her ""The Furminator!"" She then told me that her coat was all ripped and her hairs broken up. I was mortified! (and also somewhere wondering why her coat was not as soft as I thought it should be!)This *brush* was actually ripping and destroying my puppy's coat! I immediatley stopped using it on my pup - and realized that getting every hair out is not as important aas getting the LOOSE hairs out. Back to the slicker brush.",cats,2

"I really liked the look of this ball. I was super excited to give it to one of my dogs. I stuffed it with treats and gave it to my dachshund mix. He loved it too! He played with it for about 15 minutes after which, my pitty mix decided that it looked interesting. After that, the ball lasted about 2 minutes. No joke, two minutes. I saw her getting a hold of it, I turned around to watch something on tv for a moment, I turned back around and it looked like the insides of a whale.It is perfect for smaller dogs, terrible for big dogs or heavy chewers. I will stick to the Kong when it comes to my pit, she has not yet destroyed that and it has been months.The ball smells really bizarre too. A little bit like vanilla, a little bit like cinnamon. Maybe I should have used it as a fragrance in my closet or in the restroom!All in all, I think this is a really good product and I blame myself for allowing my hippo of a dog to get a hold of it. If you have a smaller dog, it should be perfect for them.",dogs,3

"I found the idea of the product very good and plugged it in immediately. One of my cats took to it immediately. The other was reluctant because of the original low mechanical whir which was barely noticeable. We left up the other box to let her have a chance to use the new one....That wasn't the problem.Within 2days, the low barely noticable whir turned into a clicking noise that was obnoxious. I tried many things, including changing litters and adjusting litter height. Too little litter meant nothing got picked up. Too much meant crunching noises above the clicking noise! Another 3 days and I came in to find that the unit was off. I pushed the top on so that it triggered the start mechanism. Came in several hours later and again it was off.It never worked properly after that and I was forced to get rid of it. Not worth the money I paid for it.",cats,2
"This is a great treat for dogs made from high quality meat (venison). They are half the price of the comparable Wellness Pure Rewards venison snacks, which are impossible to find.

"I think the product works well but probably won't stop my dog from barking. He still barks once or twice, gets sprayed and then barks again a few minutes later.

"I've been using this product for about one month. I installed it myself using a trench digger which I recommend (save yourself a fortune). My dog, a (now) 7 month old Great Dane puppy has, so far, been very receptive to this product. She was shocked several times throughout the learning process, a prospect that I was not thrilled about, but understand is necessary to learn the boundaries. She is now approximately 100 lbs and will not go outside the yard for toys, bikers, walkers, other dogs, etc. I was very surprised how quickly she picked up the concept. I do recommend going to Lowes and buying 14 gauge wire (&lt;$50) as I don't have too much confidence in the small 20g wire it comes with. The last thing I want to have to do is have to try to find a damaged/corroded wire and replace it. So far, I have no regrets about this product.",dogs,3
"This crate was great looking. It felt good. It broke down into an easy to carry thing with a built in handle. However, the little service door in the front door (feeding access) is made of smaller diameter metal than the rest of the kennel. My medium 26 lb. dog broke all the bars off the little door, escaped, chewed down 2 window curtains, one set of mini-blinds, and the back door curtain. Anyway, I figured it would be a hassle to return it and decided to twist 12 guage copper wire into strong bars to replace the now missing door. I haven't had a problem since. Also, I found that if I put the kennel near a window that little Penny could see out of, she calmed down a lot. Lesson learned, I guess.Buy it? Sure. Just make sure your dog doesn't have much anxiety. In addition to the widow thing, I also placed an old shirt in the kennel that I had worn. My scent, I believe, helps keep her calm. She hasn't had an ""accident"" since I did that. She's not a puppy, by the way.I had to replace the door. I'm not sure if that is because of faulty welds (actually, one bar was still attached and came off without much force by me) or my dogs mighty robo-bite. Whatever. The unit is very nice except for the ugly copper repair job...",dogs,3

"The Product Description from the Manufacturer is incorrect. The gate DOES NOT span 28"" to 103"" (the product description under the Manufacturer description IS correct stating that the gate spans from 60"" to 103""). Unfortunately the gap we were trying to span is 58"" (but we did improvise a solution).The wall hooks do seem a bit flimsy but the height is high enough to keep our 17 month old from trying to climb over it but low enough that I, at 5'2"", can step over it. It seems a rather imperfect solution for an awkward opening between our hallway and kitchen, but at least it's not incredibly expensive and it does work.

"This ball's success all depends on your dog. I have two dogs, 1 Lab mix and one Chihuahua mix. Neither of my dogs wanted anything to do with it. I got this for my Chihuahua but it's too big for him (he's 17 lbs). I think I scared him with it too when I first took it out of the box and rolled it on the ground and it bounced first...because it's so hard it was pretty loud and that spooked him and he was leary of it from then on out so don't make that mistake. Use it on plush carpet or outside if you have a dog that spooks over noise.BUT my parents dog (full Lab) love this ball. He will play with it out in the yard until you have to stop him or he wears himself out. Just goes crazy for it and chases it all around the yard. Never gets tired of it.So it just boils down the dog's personality and what they like or what bores them.",dogs,3
"I like this feeder better than the Petsafe feeder. This one has a wider bowl for the cats to eat from. Since I have 4 cats this makes it easier for more than 1cat to eat out of the bowl at the same time. Petsafe feeder has much smaller bowl. This feeder works better than Petsafe in having the food continue to fill the bowl. This one requires some jiggling, but the wider opening for food allows the cats to figure out how to get more food into the bowl. Petsafe doesn't replenish the bowl very effectively. Would have gone with 5 stars if the food replenishment was smoother.",cats,2

She now runs around in the back yard with the younger dog, and can stand up on her hind legs to scratch the patio door when she wants in. The improvement in her agility could be due to the glucosamine-chondroitin tablets she gets twice a day, but I think the salmon oil helps too.",dogs,3
"Our kitty (no longer a kitten, but not quite a cat) is already a very big part of our family, and is as spoiled as you might expect any youngest sibling to be. That said...despite all of her choices (after about a month of play), the Hartz Fish'N Fun Cat Toy is still played with several times each day. I'm not always good about rating items I buy on Amazon, but I HIGHLY recommend this cat toy!!! I only wish the string were a little longer, but I suspect that it's shorter for safety reasons...plus that might make it more difficult for our little Sophie to carry away her ""kill"" (like she so often does). ;-)",cats,2
We've been using this unit with multiple furry cats who like to dip their paws in the water. It has lasted well over a year. You do need to take it apart and clean it once a month or so. Every 3-4 months clean out the pump as well. The submersible pump is fully servicable,cats,2
"Our dog (golden retriever) absolutely loves these treats. He has a grain allergy, and I can certify that these did not cause any problems for his digestive system. They are very easy to rip apart, which we did for training purposes. I think they would be a good size for any dog if you are willing to put in the time to rip them up. Our dog is not picky at all, but he prefers these over some of his other treats.",dogs,3

"Frontline is great for keeping fleas and ticks off your cat or kitten. I use it on my cat. The only downside is that it doesn't dry very quickly. So, you can't really pet your cat in the spot where it's applied for a couple days. Still, it's a lot better than the alternative - a flea-infested feline friend!",cats,2

"Selcon is a cheap and easy way to suppliment your fish food. There's no way you can match their diet in the wild, but selcon helps fill in some of the gaps that normal fish food misses.For example, I buy frozen brine shrimp. The vitamin fortified shrimp are much more expensive that the regular. The only difference is that they have the equivalent to selcon already in the package.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This is a complete waste of money. I've never received less from a $100 item. It jams almost every time it runs. You still need to scoop daily. It is very inconvenient to clean, whereas a simpler litter box can be simply hosed out. The receptacle doesn't close properly, so it needs to be emptied frequently or you'll notice the odor (assuming the LitterMaid ever actually scoopes anything into it).Worst of all, it stopped working completely after about 12 months. I'm not sure what can go wrong with an electronic device that just sits there and doesn't work properly - maybe it was worn out by continuing to run back and forth every time it jammed.Maybe I should have mailed the poopy, non-working litter box back to the manufacturers just to get the small satisfaction of them having to deal with it. However, I'm not sure of the legality of mailing items with attached cat poop, and I didn't want to incur the additional expense of packaging and postage. Anyway, this junk is in the garbage now.I imagine distributor Applica Consumer Products will be facing a class action suit eventually. I look forward to hearing about it and hope I get some of my money back.Don't buy it. Maybe just get a bigger scooper (remembering that you'll still need to scoop even if you buy this item) or get one of those low-tech litter boxes with sifters. There's got to be a better alternative for you and your cat.",cats,2
The concept is great. We adopted an outdoor cat and thought this would be a great way to keep her occupied however she quickly learned where the dot was coming from thereby became bored with the toy. Maybe other cats would do this but something to think about before you purchase.,cats,2

"This is the first time I've written a review for anything I've ever bought online. I felt it was necessary to show the true joy this product has brought me and my roommates. We have a number of obnoxious dogs next door. One is a medium sized mutt named Princess with some chow in it and the others are a pair of pugs. Princess definitely led the incessant barking that went on whenever she even caught a whiff of someone beyond her fence. I feel bad for Princess as her owners give her no time to play outside of her cubicle of a yard. However, I wasn't about to let her ruin my back porch forever. This Pet Agree mutt zapper gets her attention for a good verbal command of ""No Princess!"" She learned within the first day that barking will not be tolerated. Just a quick tap of the button perks her ears up and she no longer goes on barking tirades whenever I go out on my back porch. If you are patient with the training and reinforce good behavior with a treat it should be no problem to shut that dog up. I have a good view of the dog and she is usually within 15 feet so the product rains down high frequency training deliciousness on her. Get this thing if you have a clear shot on your barky dog next door.",dogs,3
"My puppy has been commuting with me to work since he was 3 1/2 months old and when he was a baby, he would get carsick about 30 minutes into the drive each way. I felt horrible that he was so miserable for 2x a day, 5 days a week so I bought this carseat in hopes that it would make him feel more comfortable/secure in the car and thereby reduce his carsickness. The first few weeks were still pretty bad, but at least it contained his vomit (lol). However, when he was about 4 1/2 months old, the frequency of his sickness became less and less, which I'm sure had some to do with age, but I do believe this carseat actually helped him enjoy car rides as it made it easier for him to just relax and look out the window and smell all the wonderful smells. He now enjoys popping his nose out the window instead of curling up into a miserable ball, and gets excited when it's time to go for a ride! I couple the seat with a harness connected to the headrest for extra protection, which I recommend to others considering this purchase. The only real issue I have is that when you take the cover off to wash, it is a pain to put back on. The price made me hesitant at first, but considering how much we've used it the past 6 months, it was definitely worth it. I enjoy the comments I get for having a ""carseat"" for a dog. Haha. 4.5 stars",dogs,3

The male Chi then takes over and chews the hide part and softens it up, at which time the old dogs take a turn. I've never gotten more use out of a dog chew! PERFECT FOR EVEN THE TINIEST DOG.",dogs,3
"I was nervous that my dog wouldn't care about the taste because lets get real, dogs eat much worse things. But he is a 120 lb Rodesian Ridgeback and he hates the stuff.

"BUY THIS! Over the last 15 years we have had 5 cats (no more than 3 at a time---I am NOT the crazy cat lady...yet). We have bought catnip toys, chew toys, lasers, dancers, ect. But, they love, I mean LOVE, this toy! They go CRAZY! When we play with it we play tug-of-war, they growl, try to walk away with it and jump higher then we have ever seen. When we are not playing with it they are dragging it around the house, cuddling and sleeping with it. We had to replace the feathers after 2 days because they had chewed/eaten them. They are not too keen on any other attachments, just the feathers.Additionally, we bought this toy to welcome a new 7 month old. He and our 6 year old girl seem to get along well together when they play with this toy together! Da Bird has brought our cats together!!! BUY THIS!!!!!",cats,2
"I bought this pet fountain in 2010 and used it very reliably for about 2.5 years. Ultimately I ended up having to replace it because I melted the cap to the water reservoir in the dishwasher. The parts are dishwasher safe, but not if the cap falls onto the heating element. I might have been able to buy a part but I decided to get a stainless steel fountain instead.Overall I was happy with the performance of this fountain. This easily supported the water needs to two adult cats in a dry, hot climate. The motor never burned out and my cats were obsessed with the fountain - it was nearly impossible to clean it or fill it without the cats rubbing themselves all over it and getting in my way. It made virtually no noise if clean but it will make sputtering noises if the fountain is not full enough or the motor needs to be cleaned. It does seem to develop a film if you don't clean it every 1-2 weeks, but that seems pretty reasonable to me. I'm not sure how truly effective the ""filters"" are but that wasn't particularly important in my mind. I start with filtered water and am more concerned with keeping water circulating. They definitely seem to grab debris like cat hair. The filters are also easily purchased at nearly any pet store on earth.As mentioned above, I did decide to move on to a stainless steel fountain. It seems slightly more sanitary and durable to me long term, but this is not a bad fountain by any means. It's also easier to find the filters for it than my current fountain. If this fountain fits your price range and works for your needs, I think it's a good buy.",cats,2

"We have both a medium and a large version of this toy. We initially bought the medium for our Presa Canario (Bella) when she was a puppy. She had a great time nibbling and trying to get the treat out but was unable to. We lost the toy and a couple months. Later when we found it, our puppy had grown considerably and could easily pop the treats out and attempt to swallow them whole. As a result, we decided the toy was too small for her and gave it to our Norwegian Elkhound (Nikki) who also loved it. It took her several hours but she was also able to pop the treats out but being a mature dog knew better than to try to swallow them whole.Later, we decided to buy the large one for Bella and she absolutely had a blast with it. After hours she would be able to pop the treat out but we pop it back in and she would have to work at it some more.I would say this is a great toy for dogs that need stimulation and like to chew and rip things up. Although the treat can be popped out by both of our dogs the ball itself has survived several refills and weeks of play. This is not a toy i would leave the dog unattended with. If you do leave them unattended they will probably pop the treat out and eat it the first day you get it. Keep an eye on them and be there to grab the treat and pop it back in and they will get hours of focused play with this toy.It is much more difficult to get the treats out of the large toy so even if you have a smaller dog it is a good idea to go ahead and get the larger version. Bella and Nikki definitely would recommend this toy. They both love it.One small downside other than the treats popping out, the dogs do quite a bit of drooling with this toy. In the case of Bella, we had to establish that it was a toy she could only have while in the kitchen so that she wouldn't drool all over the living room carpet.In addition, the replacement treats are a bit expensive considering the amount of time they take the dog to consume. In short, i gave this 4 stars because although your dog is virtually guaranteed to have a great time with it, it's not every day toy.",dogs,3
"I have a 3yr old golden who has alot of fur between her toes and during our daily walks in the snowy weather would develop ice ball between the pads on her feet. She was stopping every few feet to try and remove them, obviously painful to her. The Muttlucks worked very well to correct this problem. I know she isn't too crazy about them from the look on her face as she sees them, but she has complied nicely. I was quite funny watching her try and walk at first but once she got outside she didn't seem to care. They stay on pretty well, only a few time did they fall off(once she brought it back to me like hey this fell off). You do need to pull the velcro straps pretty tight for them to stay on. I also like the reflective strips, as we do walk in the dark in the early morning on the days I work.",dogs,3

"I have nine cats and I take care of a feral cat I had fixed. He lives on my porch on the swing and it's winter now, so I bought two of these. He seems to really like his but I had to put it under the blanket as he was wary of it. It seems to keep him happier than when he just had the blankets. But my other cats won't use the second one. They just don't like it. Only one time have I ever seen them lying on it. I tried putting it underneath a blanket on the couch and they still laid everywhere but on it. Maybe they're just ornery. I didn't send it back because I figure there will always be other stray cats to use it for. It wasn't very expensive.",cats,2

"I switched to Merrick dog food several years ago (2007) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison - specificlly Aminopterin - and was getting worse by the day.My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed ""scrap"" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to ""re-label"" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the ""smaller"" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at ""perfect levels"" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever! My only regret is that I did not start feeding my little four-legged one Merrick sooner!",dogs,3

It would catch everything!House smell was pretty much eliminated and the dreaded cleaning of the liter was reduced to a simplistic task.

"We have had the product for about three months now. I have four dogs, three Corgi's and a Pomeranian. All four are always outside, they have crates, food and water in a heated garage and can enter and exit as they wish. The dogs love to chase cars and ATV's on the county road and farm equipment in the fields.I have a neighbour who has an ""underground"" fence and his dogs figured out they could run right through it.So, we decided to try this system. Overall I would say it is excellent in that it does what we want it to do. It does keep the dogs by the house and not down on the road or in the fields.We did have some trouble training the dogs. Finding out where to place the flags was a problem. I would walk directly out from the base unit until the collar beeped and then place a flag. Then I would walk back to the house and then walk out again, most times the flag placement was accurate, but some times I could walk 300 feet away and the collar would not beep. We called the help line and they were very helpful and told us to turn the unit down. After that the flag placement (boundary) was reproducible.I would not say I have the smartest dogs but we followed the training schedule and it was way longer than they needed. Now it may sound cruel but the first time they were ""corrected"" they ran flat out for safety.Now maybe I should not tell you this either but I took one of the collars and placed it on my wrist and I started to walk down the driveway. It was set a level 5. About 150 feet from the house I got a good shock. Not a touching an electric fence shock, not a cattle prod shock but a get my attention shock. Now I hope you don't think I am weird, for you see I grew up on a farm and sometimes things happen. You know you were told the fence was off but ...Anyways we take their collars off at night and secure them in their crates(otherwise they will bark at deer in the woods all night long). Now maybe I should not tell you this but there has been a couple of times where we put the collars on in the morning and forgot to turn on the transmitter. So without the collar they will run all over, but with the collar on they stay up by the house. Interestingly it does not seem to matter is the unit is on or off. A conditioned response?Early on I witnessed one of the dogs take off for the road with the system on. Running flat out! It ran through the boundary and then stopped dead, looked at me (like it was my fault) and ran to me as fast as it could. Now maybe they ""try"" the system while I am at work but I have never seen one of the dogs outside the boundary with its collar and the base unit on!One of the dogs has its collar but has lost the sensor, somewhere out in the snow. We have looked everywhere and can not find it. This dog has regressed to its former behavior. A vehicle drives by and it runs down to chase it. So we have ordered a new collar.Maybe the next generation the collar will have GPS and an iPhone app ""Find My Collar.""This summer we are going camping and rather than tie the dogs to a tree we will give this system a test in the campground.So on the upside; I am very impressed for it definitely trains the dogs to stay inside the boundary.On the downside",dogs,3

"we have spent a full year trying to cure 2 cats of sneezing coughing & congestion. vets have told us at various times it was viral, its allergies, not sure learn to live with. since we have other cats who don't have the same symptoms, we didn't know what to do.the congestion was severe - they would cough up huge wads of snot and swallow it back up. they would also vomit up clear snotty liquid. sneezing? 5, 6, 7 times in a row.it was exasperating.we tried antihistamines as directed by our vet. it was a short term solution that would alleviate symptoms for a day at best and the struggle to get the pill down their throat was epic.at wit's end, i ordered a bottle of this stuff. it works. i tested on one of the cats first. 6 drops in his food- the result was almost immediate. symptoms just waned. after the second dosage, they were gone.dosing the cats is painless- i place the drops on their canned food or int he water.

I figured a cage with a great dane pictured on the packaging would be suitable for a great dane, seems logical, right?I locked my dane in here and left the room. she escaped in moments. All that needs to be done to escape is to press with enough force to pop open the front. I went in myself and could easily escape by simply pressing the gate with enough force.The latches are not long enough to stand the force of a dane pushing the door. The next try she grabbed it with her teeth and pulled the front gate, this caused the entire front to come loose from the rest of the crate. Because the front came loose there were sharp edges that cut her nose.I would not buy this again, and DO NOT recommend.

I check it once in the morning and once in the evening and have to change the waste container about once a week. It is so much more convenient to deal with compared to convential pans.

"I have to deal with entertaining three cats in the house, and this toy is by far the one that has maintained their interest the longest.

"This bed is attractive, and apparently comfortable, since our picky dog loved it. But four washings into its short life, the stitching came out around the center section, dumping large amounts of stuffing into the dryer. We followed the care instructions and washed it only in commercial-sized washers without agitators and tumble dried it on low. It fell apart at our dry cleaner--we got tired of waiting the five hours the bed takes to dry on low at the laundromat, another big drawback of a bed without a removable cover. She repaired it for free (no small task), but we aren't allowed to bring it back.I guess it was nice while it lasted, but I expected that something claiming to be ""machine washable"" and ""made of the finest materials available"" would survive more than four trips through the wash. Between the purchase price, shipping, and the cost of washing the thing over its brief stay in our home (about $130 in total), I've learned my lesson. I'm never buying another bed that requires a commercial washer/dryer and that you wash the whole bed. The cost and trouble for something that fell apart quickly was ridiculous. Our dog's next bed will have a removable corner we can wash at home.",dogs,3

"They don't last forever -- one dog chewed one up and the last one wore out after 10 years. I haven't seen anything better, but they are built reasonably and work just fine. The large model seems appropriate for dogs up to about 80 pounds (thinking retriever type body size). I've used these with 4 different dogs and they all learned to use it very quickly. The current dog learned to use it when she was 3 months old and under 20 pounds. Treats, encouragement, and some help make the learning process go quickly.",cats,2
"I purchased this for my always hungry fat cat in hopes to get her to stop constantly begging. So far this product has been great. She has realized that the mysterious black machine is responsible for her food, and not me! I occasionally find her sitting in front of the feeder just staring and waiting. and if she's in another part of the house and hears it dispense a meal she comes RUNNING.When we first set the feeder up she could see and smell the food and thought she could break in and help herself. She has tried everything from scratching, to knawing, to tipping the feeder over and has failed to get it open. She has finally given up trying to outsmart the machine.Score ONE for me - ZERO for my fat little baby!UPDATE - After five months I noticed that fatty had started to claw up the food chute to retrieve a few little kibbles at a time. We had to wrap some thick rubber bands around the opening to the chute so that the opening was less exposed. This probably won't be an issue for most cats, but my cat is very motivated and ALWAYS hungry.",cats,2
My 18-year old maltese-poodle mix has been taking NaturVet Glucosamine DS Time Release with MSM and Chondroitin since she was 14 1/2 years old. It has helped keep her active and comfortable.

I found this on Amazon for under $11 with free shipping. I know this is a great product. Small dogs can have their esophagus/trach area injured and damaged from collars with pulling.

"I own both the CatIt track and the Cat Tracks toys for my kitties. I thought this might be a nice addition to those toys. Firstly, it is too large for the CatIt Track. Secondly it fits the Cat Tracks just fine and is much quieter than their original ball included in the set. My kitties seem to enjoy the flashing lights. Only time will tell how long it lasts. There were no instructions on the packaging so I don't know if anything can be replaced or if you have to buy a new ball when it quits working.I liked this well enough that I purchased an additional one just for them to play without the track.UPDATE",cats,2

This is the best Aquarium glass cleaner I have ever had. Cleans great. You can go around the corners and it floats so you can catch it on the other side.

"An absolute hit with my two cats from day one! I was looking for a scratching post that would not fall over when the cats scratch it and this absolutely delivers! In fact, my cats, both full grown and weighing at least 12 lbs each, have each ""climbed"" it as shown in the photo and the thing has not even started to tip over at all. Very sturdy and they love the height that they can stretch to when scratching. I would also say that as scratching posts go, this one is a nice, attractive design that you would put beside your couch and not feel like it was that distracting. In fact, it would make a decent plant stand as well! (of course, not for a plant in a breakable pot or one that would attract the cats!) All around a great item!",cats,2
"This cat fountain is amazing! It's really quiet, holds alot more water than other fountain models, and is easy to clean.

We found if we run our hands around the globe to break up the static eventually the water will make it's way all the way around.Looking forward to having this fountain a long time.",cats,2

"I bought this litter box because cleaning it is my oldest daughter's chore so it is always a struggle and I have to help out in the end because if she misses a day or two the clumps are hard to remove on our old litter box.As soon as we received the new rollover litter box we assembled it and had to make sure all the clips were secure. After one test ""rollover"" we had a bit of an accident and some of the litter came out from the backside from one of the clips that was not securely locked.We made sure the clip went thru all the way to the locking position and we have had it for a month now, and my daughter loves the ease to it and will not complain about cleaning her pet's litter box anymore.The plastic is thinner around the clips than our old litter box, but I don't think we will have any issues as long as we are not assembling and disassembling the box. The clips look like they might come off if we play with them often so we just try to keep the box with enough kitty litter and cleaning everyday to avoid any clumps sticking to the box.I defenetly recommend this box and I would tamper with the clips when they come off just to keep this litter box, it is really easy to clean.

"I have purchased the small and medium sized kongs for a chihuahua and a shih tzu. I originally purchased it as a way to keep my dogs entertained while I was away from home, but it has proved to help in other ways. I will put a milkbone in it to keep them entertained or freeze something like peanut butter or yogurt. Sometimes they can't get to the food that is stuck at the top of the kong and I have to remove it and clean the kong out, but that usually isn't a big deal. It can get messy on carpet, depending on what you use, so you may want to keep it in a kennel or kitchen if you use something that can melt like peanut butter or yogurt. But my chihuahua is a very picky eater and I've found that, like a little kid, sometimes she eats better when she has a game to play with her food. I put her kibble in the kong and she will carry it to the room she wants to be in, then knock the kong around and when little pieces of kibble fall out, she will eat them. That is sometimes the only way I can get her to eat her food! I'm glad I have a couple kongs around the house.",dogs,3

"These filters work REALLY well. I have 10 2-3.5"" red Belly piranha in a 75 gal set-up and with two of these filters i have no problem. All particles from feeding and the 6"" common pleco and two 2"" albino plecos. The water level does have to be pretty much at the highest level you can keep em to cut down on noise but the front cover also does a lot of sound blocking. My fish tank is in my room and i don't have a problem getting to sleep, the soft sound of running water is actually quite relaxing. I've heard a bunch of comments on the noise it makes when you first put it in, if you prime it before turning it on the noise is there for only 5-10 seconds and then once the cover is on there is nothing but a whiper from the motor and a slight sound of running water. I will definately invest in some more of these when i get my 150 gal tank up and running, get 2-3 more because i plan on having a fairly large amount of red bellies inhabiting it :)",fish aquatic pets,4

Her waste would cake up on the rake, and the waste trap would fill up very fast and I'd have to go in and empty it at least every 4-5 days. Since it has a 90 day guarantee, it was worth a try. But if your cat has soft stools - skip it.",cats,2
"I've always fed my cats ""good"" food, per my vet's recommendations (Royal Canin (sp) or Science Diet). But I made a crazy mistake when my cats turned 7; given Science Diet recommends a switch to a geriatric food at age 7, I changed to the geriatric formula. BAD decision. I have Siamese cats (boy weighed 9# and girl weighed 7#) - over the course of 9 months, they each lost about a pound, which is a LOT for these little guys! Talked to my vet and he said my cats definitely did NOT need a geriatric diet yet. They are extremely active, as are most Orientals.Instead of switching back to their old Science Diet, I asked friends who did rescue work and friends who were breeders for their recommendations",cats,2
"I have tried the Petmate brand fountain, only to throw it out after 6 months. It was too disgusting even to donate. No matter how often I cleaned it, it always seemed to get slimy and gross, especially on the "" ramp"". The next one was the regular Drinkwell fountain. I WISH I would've spent a little more to get the Drinkwell Platinum , because when I travel, with 3 cats at home, in less than 2 days the water level would be low enough where it was loud and sounding like the motor was burning out? So the platinum one is GREAT because it doesn't get yucky, is quiet, and i love that it holds a ton of water, which is a big relief if you travel. You won't regret spending the extra $$ getting the platinum one.",cats,2

"I have two dogs who spend most of their lives in either the back yard or our living room. We bought a new couch and decided that this one, unlike the last, would be off limits to the dogs. This isn't ideal, of course. If you want your dogs off the furniture, it's always best to be consistent with that message right from when they are a puppy. We hoped, however, that the new couch would be different enough so that they wouldn't get confused. It's been about a week and we don't really need the mats anymore. I still leave them on most of the time, but even when they are off the dogs don't even think about jumping on the couch.Now, as for the shock, it's not that bad. We leave ours on high and I've been shocked plenty of times and so has my fianc&eacute;e. It is much more surprising then painful for us, and I would assume for the dogs as well. Though when we first got the new couch our lab, after being shocked while standing on it, came back to sniff this new insult in the middle of his room and got zapped right on the nose. We felt a little bad about that. There was no yelping or anything dramatic though. He just seemed very surprised.I originally thought of a mat that held a charge at it's surface and then released it at the slightest touch. That doesn't seem to be how it works though, which is a good thing, I suppose, if you don't feel like replacing your battery 5 minutes after you lay the mat on something a little too conductive. Just keep this in mind when you first get it and try testing it out. You'll put in the battery, turn it on low, hover your hand over it for 20 seconds while you get up the courage, then quickly tap it ever so lightly and gently. That won't do it though. It somehow notices motion or some other kind of disturbance, then lets out three quick shocks about a half second apart. So just build up a little more courage and put the side of your hand down on it like you mean it.",dogs,3
Thank you to the other customers who suggested that people buy a medium Treat Ball. My little dogs popped the treat out of the small one in a matter of minutes. When I first brought home the medium Treat Ball I was afraid that my three little ten pound dogs couldn't lift it. They had no problem lifting it and they couldn't pop out the treat. I had to buy three so they could each have their own. It was a good investment because they last at least a week and they really enjoy it.A few months after my review....My little dogs destroyed three of these. I still gave the ball four stars because I can't find anything else comparable. I don't like to give them too much rawhide.,dogs,3

"Maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but honestly, I can't understand all the rave reviews. I have a 4-month-old kitten and I am well aware that kittens will use up litter much faster than adult cats, but we're still talking ONE CAT and I am only on day 5 of a fresh cartridge and the smell is already so intolerable that I can't be within 5 feet of the box without retching. It literally smells like someone peed in a leather boot filled with oatmeal and then microwaved it for 15 minutes. Anyone that says they manage with one cartridge for 30 days is either a liar, criminally insane or lost their sense of smell in some freak, manure-huffing accident. To contrast, I had no odor problems with the scooping litter I was originally using (I'm talking a post-poopfest, pre-scoop, completely-thrashed litter box too). Also, even with the hood and the carpet (yes - I'm the sucker that bought all the accessories), the crystals get EVERYWHERE. Then there's the price of the refills. $51.99 for three, or $99.99 for six. The audacity to charge over 15 dollars for a piece of cardboard and a pound of litter is breathtakingly criminal, and that's even if they lasted as long as the company advertises. I bought a 3-pack of litter cartridges. With these, along with the one that comes with the box, I thought I would be set for 4 months of scoop-free bliss... how sorely mistaken I was. I am already on the third cartridge and I'm already about to toss it and pop in the last one.On to the rake system",cats,2

"The Pet Jet is great. Although my Pet Jet came with instructions in French, I didn't even need to read them because it was self-explanatory. The only thing that gave me a panic at first was that it didn't fit my sink faucet. But then I removed 1 of 2 washers, and then it fit perfectly. I later went to M2Pets website & downloaded the instructions in English and I saw that the washer thing was explained. So, depending on your use of the Pet Jet, you may leave both washers in or remove one of the washers.I prefer just to pour the shampoo directly on my dog, so I can't really speak as to how well the shampoo reservoir works. But I can say the sprayer is very powerful & I love how you can make it so that it keeps spraying without you having to hold down the handle. That's very useful.Note--I noticed recently that it says ""Hose not Included"" in the description. I don't know why it says that. That description wasn't there when I bought it & it does have a hose (the one in the picture). So, I'm not sure what's up with that.",cats,2

"This treat ball is probably not for every dog, but our 8 month old Shiba Inu puppy absolutely adores it and so do we. Our trainer recommended that we use a treat ball as a way to challenge our puppy and focus his energy on something ""productive"" (for him, at least). This does the trick better than any other similar product. It is very durable yet (unlike a Buster Cube) soft enough that nothing gets damaged as it rolls into walls, chairs and the like. We use it for half of his kibble at each meal. After about 4 weeks of daily use, our ball is starting to show signs of wear but we have gotten far more use out of this than any other ""toy"" we've purchased.Our puppy is a high energy, very food motivated, tough-chewing, smart little guy who can get treats out of his Kong and open the child gate in under 5 minutes. But while this treat ball requires patience, our normally ""A.D.D."" puppy will persistently push this ball around the kitchen until he gets every last piece of kibble out. That can take 20-30 minutes. The ball does not make a good ""chew toy"" for a tough chewer (like our dog, who can chew off the top of a red Kong), however. We make sure to take it away after he empties it. Otherwise, it would never have lasted this long.",dogs,3

Plus I use it on my horse's mane and tail and it is the quickest way to have them smooth and untangled without pulling half of his tail/mane out with the tangles.,dogs,3
"We started using Dasuquin for our labrador retrievers a few years ago. We used it for about 18 months and weren't sure if it was making any difference. So we stopped giving it. About 6 weeks later, we noticed the dogs were getting stiffer more often. Realized the Dasuquin had helped and started up again. Noticable improvement with this product. Did not see same results with some of the competing products.",dogs,3
This thing is great! It is the manual concept of the litter robot at 1/10th the price and has no moving parts to break! The omega claw does need to be emptied more often (once every 1-2 days) but also smells less than the litter robot did because of this. Get a nice tight lidded trashcan to go beside it for your daily emptying. I have had no problems whatsoever and definitely think anything but the large would be too small.,cats,2
"This device is designed for low output pumps like those used on small tanks but then it takes up too much tank space. It handles about 65 GPH and what I really needed was something that would take care of 2,000 GPH. It actually fell apart into peices as I handled it.",fish aquatic pets,4

"It is about the size of a tennis ball, and seems to be pretty tough. I was a little skeptical because we have a dog that loves to chew, we have only had a few weeks and it has been holding up fine. The food or treats have to be pretty small to get in the hole, but it just takes the dogs that much longer to get out.",dogs,3

"I discovered this leash at my vets and was drawn to it because of the really cute designs. I also really liked the clip which you could just ""slap"" onto the dog collar rather than using the usual thumb-slider clip. The leash also has a padded handle which is very much appreciated when you have 70 pounds of dog pulling against you to get out at that lovely poodle coming your way...What has turned me into a customer for life for Lupine is their replacement guarantee. I originally bought a leash and collar when my dogs were puppies -- fuzzy bundles of chewing teeth. I was crate training them and would leave the collars on while they were in their crates. Don't ask me how but one of my dogs had this incredible talent for chewing the collar off. Lupine replaced it no questions asked. It happened again. They did it again. By this point, I caught a clue and no longer left the collar on my dog while unattended.However, there aren't many companies that will stand behind their product like Lupine does -- even when their customers are not the most clueful people in the world. When I would email them, they were always incredibly friendly and it was a personalized response.In essence, if you buy one Lupine leash, that is the only leash you will ever need to buy because Lupine will stand behind it. However, in reality, because customer service like this is so hard to find (not to mention the leashes and collars are so nice compared to others out there), you want to continue to support the company by purchasing more collars throughout the years.I can't recommend these leashes and the company enough!",dogs,3
"I am really pleased with this product and so are my cats. The Cat Washroom looks beautiful in my bedroom - much better than a plastic litter box. In addition to looking good, the product eliminates odors and cuts back on kitty litter on my hardwood floor. The cats began using it immediately. I highly recommend the Cat Washroom/Night Stand - it is worth the price, in my opinion.",cats,2

We have had our 8 gallon Biorb for almost 3 years so I think I've had enough experience to write an honest review.

Great for training my cane corso. He does both basic training and protection training and he exercises for at least a half hour afterwards so these are great. We do this twice a day and he never gets tired of the treats. The treats are different sizes as some complain but I just tear up the larger treats so I don't mind. The price is great b/c my corso is 70ls now and will get to 140. He can pound through the treats.,dogs,3

"My 2 cats like this catnip but nothing ""crazy"" or weird went on, they just rolled around and rubbed their faces in it (one even ate some). Nothing different from regular catnip. Actually I had another brand that produced crazier reactions like drooling and hyperactivity. Can't remember the brand tho.And I smelled the stuff and it seemed stale, the date on the back said copyright 2004! This is 2008! Maybe if you get a fresher batch it will be craziness all around.",cats,2
"We purchased this collar for our dog who is very dog reactive. It hasn't helped with his out of control lunging, but that could just be our crazy dog.

I would expect longer wear from the product. Disappointing.",dogs,3
"My dog has over 40 toys, but the giraffe is by far her favorite and is played with daily many time. Wears well too, but after 16 months she is due for another. Our minpin & chihuahua mix even got a real puppy after she babied the giraffe. She takes care of both.",dogs,3
"This is one of the larger litter boxes on the market and we needed it because we have two really 'productive' cats. The bottom half is nice and deep and has no platform in it so you can fill it up with a ton of litter if you like. Since female cats don't squat very low, it's also helpful to have the high rim which prevents leakage. The product feels reasonably sturdy and is an overall good value for the cost.",cats,2
"It is a great product. It is very nutritional and our dogs absolutely love them. My only issue is that it is outrageously expensive. It is about four times as expensive as coffee per pound, and coffee is already expensive. Liver is a very cheap meat so why $25 per pound. Our problem is our dogs will do anything to get one of these treats, so were stuck.",dogs,3
My Border Collie really enjoys the stix. My concern is that there is no labeling that tells me exactly what the produce is made of nor is there a nutritional breakdown.,dogs,3
"The bowl definitely works. The dog eats his food much more slowly. The cons of this product are that it is so light weight plastic that it slides too much. To solve the problem, I went to a discount store and bought a cheap metal bowl and took the rubber ring off of the base and put it on this bowl. That helps a lot.The second con is the price. I think the price is outrageous for a piece of molded plastic.",cats,2
"There is no doubt about that, and this cheap little device has been handy. A word of caution however, is that it simply will not train your dog. I looked up how to get my dog to quit jumping and it works. This little contraption however can be used to reinforce those ideas.",dogs,3

"These ducks have been our Jack Russells favorite toy for years. My local pet store doesn't carry them anymore so I have purchased several online to keep a stash. They do have to be washed and occasionally a hole stiched up or a foot sewn back on, (he likes to shake them) but it's worth it. He has a box full of other plush toys but this duck is his preference 9 out of 10 times. I will be sad the day that these ducks are no longer available, the joy they bring my dog is undescribable!!!!!",dogs,3
I have a very aggressive chewer and he has yet to get any kind of hole or chunk off of this ball. It is really tough but yet soft enough for him to get a good grip (it is hollow). A hole in one end lets treats be put inside too. I highly recommend this ball for your happy ball chaser.,dogs,3
"Since getting a dog my house looks like a daycare with all the toys thrown about. This by far is probably one of the cutest. My dog has no interest in getting the bees out of the hive but she likes them on their own. She has been able to rip the fuzz off their heads if she works at it. The hive is a bit big for her but the bees are the right size (she's a Cavalier King Charles). Her nose is smaller so without shoving her entire head in the hive hole she has a hard time trying to get anything out of it and loses interest quickly. She has fun batting the hives and bees around though. We did find she's more willing to try to get her favorite ball out of the hive than the bees - so that's an option if your dog doesn't care for the bees. Another tip someone told us, was to put the bees in your dirty laundry for a few days before giving them to your dog - they'll be more willing (supposedly) to hunt for them because they smell like you.",dogs,3
"The Wizdog concept is a great idea. It has the potential to be perfect for me and my dog.The problem is the grate is made of a hard flimsy crackable plastic with jagged edges! I cannot understand why they've chosen such an inappropriate plastic for the grate. It will bend and crack just by holding it in your hand. It is impossible to clean it daily without it breaking. I have replaced the grate and the same thing happened again. It is actually stressful trying to handle it without it breaking. Even before it breaks, the plastic has jagged edges that can hurt a pups paw. When it cracks it can be downright dangerous. I contacted the company last year and they said they were working on redesigning it. One year later they have not. I wonder how many dogs they have hurt. You will waste your money if you purchase this product prior to them redesigning the grate with a better plastic.",dogs,3

this thing is noisy (from the impeller). Its installed correctly and I went through the troubleshootingsection even though its pretty basic on how to install everything. I have older bio wheel filters and they seemto have cut corners in the quality lately. I emailed the company to see if they will send me a replacementimpeller and they do not even bother to reply.

"I have a 55lb, 11 year old brown mutt of uknown origins who is afraid of thunderstorms. If I give her 3 of these when I know they're coming, it takes the edge off enough so that she just pants a little but is able to just ride out the storm, so to speak. Without these, she is usually hiding under my feet or in my lap. These are also helpful at nighttime for her - she has allergies that make her itch and lick during the night, so 3 of these before bedtime seem to relax her enough so that she sleeps for most of the night without itching.",dogs,3
"Which is not a good thing. I purchased this product as I have a teething puppy who is chewing everything she can fit into her mouth. I was hoping Bitter Yuck would discourage some of the chewing, but I was finding that it wasn't. So to test it further I spayed a healthy puddle of it in the palm of my hand. The puppy went crazy over it and licked my palm clean. I called my adult dog over and the result was the same. He loved it as well. I tried a similar product (also water based) called Phooey. Both dogs went nuts over this product as well licking my palm clean. Lastly I tried some Bitter Apple. This one they didn't like at all, but dogs took a lick and pulled their heads back in disgust.While a nice concept, Bitter Yuck instead is an attractant and a treat. It encourages the exact behaviors it is marketed to prevent. At least with my two dogs, YMMV.",dogs,3

"I bought one of these at the local pet store because the reviews on here we so mixed. It either had 1 star or 5 stars. Also my brothers pit bull has had one for 2 years w/o destroying it.With those in mind, I gave it a chance. My puppy (7 month old Golden) had the entirety of the stuffing out, and a hole my fist could fit inside, in slightly under 2 hours.However I did not get to test the floating aspect of the toy, so I may take it back to Petco (they have 30 day return on everything they sell) and exchange it for one that just becomes a lake toy, where Duke wont have a dedicated chewing session on it. Might be perfect for that.Also, I seem to think as dogs get older their need to destroy may diminish. So that could be why the such polarized reviews. Perhaps in another couple of years my dog will get to enjoy this toy for months instead of minutes.",dogs,3

"I bought these to dose an aquarium with fertilizer and fill small test tubes. They didn't work out, though. After less than two months they started to become rough and eventually bind. I realize that my application isn't conventional, but I think the issues I had also apply to their intended use.The good:-The markings have held up well, though they are starting to fade. Putting packing tape over the cylinder might be a good way to preserve them, but I haven't tried it.-Fairly high capacity.-The tapered tips lets you tailor them to a certain use.The bad:-Although they started out smooth, that didn't last long. In my case their useful life was only two months while being used every one or two days.-The plungers lock when depressed all the way, which makes extracting something difficult because you have to pop it loose. I don't understand why their designed that way, but if someone knows of a reason for it, then feel free to post a comment.",cats,2

"Fish love it but they eat almost anything. I used to use this for my large Jack Dempsey which I did notice a color change with, still waiting for my Pacus to get more color. Reason I bought it from Amazon instead of the fish store is they were closed over the weekend and Prime would allow me to get it faster. It was not cheaper, as it should be, it was one dollar more and I was charged tax.

I still monitor his elimination just in case, though. Amazon really does have the cheapest price, too.",cats,2

"We've been using this for about 6 months now. It sure beats a shovel, clamp type scoop, or the 'hand and glove/bag' method. But there are a few caveats. What you can't see from the picture is that each of those thick wires end in blunt tines. They are rather long too. Those ends get snagged in the grass quite frequently. Now, we live in Florida and the grass here is more like a weed with lots of low growing off-shoots that criss-cross rather than the beautiful carpet like grass that grows elsewhere. So with normal grass that's kept short it may not be so much of a problem. With the type of grass we have, it is. After 6 months it's a little bent out of shape from snagging and then having to be pulled out-- which also sometimes results in poop chunks flying. Yuck. The only other problem we've had with it is occasionally the small bits fall through the wires. Our dog is about 17 lbs so not huge but not a mini-mini either. It would be perfect for a medium to large dog in a sandy yard :) Anything outside of that takes a little finessing. I'd still rather use this than anything else that's available, just not quite perfect. And it stays pretty clean too; not much there to get gunked up.",dogs,3

Obviously that was pretty dangerous, so I decided to try out this product - we love it! The harness is very adjustable so it fits him snugly. The seatbelt works great! If you don't want to use the harness it will snap onto their collar or other harness just fine. Our dog now sits in the backseat with his seatbelt safe and sound - no more running red lights while trying to fight off our dog taking a flying leap into the steering wheel.Driving with our dog is SO much easier now! Definitely give this product a try. You can't go wrong with a price like this!",dogs,3
I really like this product. Does the job it is intended for. Keeps pets away from areas you don't want them to be in. The only drawback from my point of view is the unit has to be in place for the deterrent factor to work...once my cat noticed the can wasn't there he went in the forbidden room. It will work much better if the unit can stay in place but unfortunately my situation would not allow such. The product is just as advertised but it still requires work from the owner.,cats,2
"I expected more from this product. We tried this natural spray at Kaymart that worked even worse. Maybe the Frontline needs several months to work, but based on the results we had with the first application, we are unsatisfied.

It says that it will continue to work for up to three months, but it did not for us. I will try it once more after a month has past but so far, not working too well.",dogs,3

Not realizing that was the culprit for the seizures, she was placed on seizure medication. We completed the class, we stopped with the pup peronis. We just purchased another pup, and began training with him. Because he was getting the pup peronis, so was the 2 year old dog and she began having seizures again.

"This automatic feeder is a great way to allot meals to my cats while I am away. I have a strict, multiple-meal per day feeding schedule (for health reasons) and this feeder takes over that task when I am at work. My cats took to it instantly and now recognize the slight noise it makes when turning to the next portion as meal time.As some reviewers have mentioned, the tray is quite easy to turn manually and animals could sneak into the next portion, but that has not been a problem for my cats. They sure can smell the food and sometimes paw at the tray but haven't tried to turn the tray. The tray is easy to remove and clean. The sidewalls of the portion dishes are slightly slanted to cut down on wasted food stuck in the corners. Programming this unit is extremely easy; you can program feeding at any time AM or PM. There is also an option to suspend feeding if you want to essentially 'pause' the auto-feeding schedule.The only suggestion I have for improvement is to have a compartment under the tray to store an ice pack. I feed only wet food so when I leave meals for the day I have to freeze meal portions for later scheduled feedings.All in all, I am very pleased with this product. I plan to purchase another in the near future.",cats,2

"This design is a good idea, but there are a few drawbacks.Pros:I no longer have to go treasure hunting and can just easily do it all in one swoop.Works as well as all other covered litter boxes in containing litter and smellsCons:First off, the latches on mine don't seem to fit snugly half the time, leaving a small gap on the right side. When I go to roll the box, I get a small pile of litter on the floor from the gap. My solution was to attempt latching that one first. It's the one on the front next to the scoop.Second, clumping litter is really the only kind of litter you should use with this box. However, my cats like to pee in one part of the box and poo everywhere else, so the pee all clumps up in a giant mass on the bottom. When you roll the box, you have to give the bottom a few good whacks to get that stuff off the bottom. Sometimes litter goes flying out the door doing this.Clean the box often, with two cats the box can fill up fast and the scoop drawer can get over full and not fit through the hole very well.Sometimes smaller pieces of poop and pee clumps can fit through the screen. Also some will get caught under the scoop and wont really come out until you do a thorough cleaning.Lastly, the top is clumsy to remove when you need to add/change the litter.Overall, regardless of all the cons, It's a pretty good litter box and I recommend it.",cats,2
"These pads are small, and I did want something smaller than the 24x24 I had. But the puppy is only 10 weeks old and he can 'fill' a pad because it spreads out instead of the 'gel' absorbing of my other pads.

"After dealing with my cat peeing on the dining room floor for months, I bought this product out of desperation. I was impressed with the positive reviews and figured it was worth a shot.

"I am very pleased with this dog stroller. It's just as illustrated and described. Great,sand color with Jeep emblems on the wheels, handle, and pocket. Easy partial assembly...only the wheels to attach. The fabric is durable and the seams appear well stitched. The zippers are large (less likely to break) and require fastening as you would a jacket zipper. The most shocking aspect was the ease with which I was able to fold it! It only required one hand and it was ready to stow away. Now my old, blind, incontinent, grouchy, cuddly dog can ride when he gets too tired to walk. He and I are off to the local farmer's market in the morning thanks to the little storage basket under his new ""Jeep"".",cats,2

"Our 12 yr old shepherd mix has been taking this for about a year. Our vet reccommended it, he thinks that dogs digest it better than pills. I wasn't sure, but figured I would try it.Within a week I saw a difference in our dog. He was a LOT more lively. And he clearly felt better. In fact, he felt good enough that he started stealing food off the kitchen counters again. I was so happy to see that, it represented progress forward (instead of just holding steady, which was my best hope for his arthritis).I reccommend this product to so many of my friend with dogs. It is really amazing what it can do and how well it works. Best of all, the dogs love it. I don't have to smear peanut butter on some pill and hope he'll swallow it. If you have a dog with arthritis or hip dysplasia, this is worth trying.",dogs,3

"We used to spend so much money on cat toys it was absurd. This is the LAST one I will ever buy for a cat. I bought six for Christmas gifts for friends with feline friends, and they all agree - THIS IS THE #1 Cat Toy of the Millenium. Seriously. My cat loves it, drags it around the house and gets the best, healthiest exercise of anything we've ever tried. It has a clear plastic wand that I've stepped on a zillion times and it does not break. The rubber that holds the material on KEEPS the material on it, no matter what. It's sturdy and the colors make it easy to find on the carpets. Turn your adult cat into a kitten again.

She would shake and pant and would want to crawl inside me if she could, now it's just a raise of the head. She's more confident on walks...it's worth a try people, it may not work for everyone, but I'm extremely thankful it worked for me and her!

"My dog had BUN levels in the higher end of the normal range from the time I adopted her. I have her blood tested twice a year because of the many health issues my last dog had -- I always wish I had known about her problems sooner so I could have taken some preventative measures rather than wait until the problem was major.When my current dog's BUN levels finally went above the normal range, I searched for something that could help before permanent kidney problems occurred (my last dog had kidney failure among other things, and I could not go through that again, especially with a dog so young). I give her these Renal Essentials daily, and her BUN level is lower than it was when I first adopted her. I will continue to give this to her daily unless the vet says or the blood work shows that it could cause problems.",dogs,3
"This product is VERY jumbo! I bought this for my kittens, because they love to gather together at feeding time so I thought they'd enjoy having room to drink at the same time. The main problem with this is that sediment gathers at the bottom of the well very easily and the filter isn't strong enough to get it out. So basically every day you have to unplug it, drag the power cord to the nearest sink, and get the whole thing in the sink to rinse it out without spilling water all over the place. I was unhappy with this product and I really couldn't see myself going through all that hassle every day to rinse out the well, so I returned the product.",cats,2

Also, it fits comfortably and is a bit challenging to fit properly to your dog's size but once the size it set, it is secure and also allows comfort. It is well made and lasts forever. I have replaced these perhaps twice in the past but not due to damage but just because they got so dirty. They can be washed but at some point it feels better to just get a clean new one. After one of my dogs flew from the backseat into the front passenger foot area at a sudden red light stop a few years back, I never let my dogs go in the car without seat belts secured through this harness. Very grateful.",dogs,3
"I have 5 cats, and, let's face it, while they are so freakin' sweet & adorable, they can also be messy pigs (like men... no offense!). How high do the sides of a litter box need to be?! No matter how high & even with the lid, one of my sweet, grody kitties manages to pee just high enough that it leaks out the back... EEEWWWW, GROSS!!!! But with this Litter Box, NO LEAKAGE! (They need to invent something like this for me to put on toilets... no wonder that urinals go halfway up the wall! Again, No Offense!) But, I digress... the way the top snaps onto the bottom half, it becomes leak proof and I Love It! I got rid of the husbands, but I would NEVER get rid of my cats (this time offense is meant to my Ex's!). It's a great litter box and if you really want to make the whole disgusting ordeal even better, or should I say, not as disgusting, YOU MUST GET THE LITTER LOCKER, sold here on Amazon!

"I purchased this litter box when it first came out in the 90's and was so absolutely thrilled with the ease and cleanliness of removing clumps that I have recommended it to friends ever since!

Now when her customers and friends come to visit, they smell nothing and see no litter. The kitty is happy because the box gets cleaned much more often too. There are no ""stray"" bowel movements or urine on the porch floor either.I would recommend the larger box for kitties that are big or long, however, because the smaller one may not have enough interior room for larger cats to maneuver.",cats,2

"I've always known catnip had some strange magical hold on the feline population. I have had my cats for about a year and a half now, and after a brief stint with some grocery-bought ""catnip"" toys that didn't elicit a response, I had given up on the catnip miracle. Until, that is, I received this mat for Christmas.Both cats were enamored by this mat. Our female rolled all over it, drooling like a maniac. Our male preferred to try to eat the stuff. They'd both get mad at the idea of sharing and then we decided we needed to buy another...or two.The first night though, I had put the plastic catnip bag inside a larger bag with some other gifts, at the bottom. In the morning it was open and the catnip was strewn all over the floor. Earlier that morning our male was above my head in bed, drooling and kneading. I tried to move him, which usually causes him to jump off the bed but instead he fell next to my boyfriend and I on his back and dozed into a purring ecstasy. We realized why when we finally got up and assumed he ingested a great deal of the stuff, spiraling into the equivalent of a happy kitty overdose.",cats,2

Maybe it worth it at the end but so fur I'm just mad and hurt. Really hard to clean, litter sticks to the plastic and it's just a mess. It's better to pay more for the better quality.",cats,2

"Can't say too much about this cup only that it works as intended! The clamp holds the cup very secure. It doesn't budge once you screw it down tight (but not too tight!). I ordered the 8oz cup to use as my dog's food bowl (I previously bought a 32oz cup that hangs). Having both the clamp and hang-style cups, I must say that either one will work. However, I would advise against getting the large (48oz+) cup in the clamp-style version. That much weight with food or water in it may put a lot of tension on the welds of the clamp over time. Nonetheless, I'm impressed with this cup. Definitely worth purchasing.***12/26/12 Update",dogs,3

I think this is really helping my older cat with kidney issues. I'm using some other supplements but I recently added this and she seems not to mind it as long as I just put a very small bit into her meals (she gets about 3 small meals a day). Her coat is much softer and she seems more alert and energetic - great signs for a short time with the product.Also I had ordered 2 of the product by mistake and the return was easy and the seller quickly gave me a refund.Years ago I used Missing Link for dogs with an abused dog I rescued. She had patchy fur and was just a wreck. Well after giving her the supplement not long after to my horror almost all of her fur fell out. I kept the faith and sure enough it grew back and she developed a beautiful fluffy coat. She regained her well-being and I was able to place her with a forever family :)So I have long been a fan of Missing Link - for some reason I never tried it with my cat and wish i would have been supplementing her diet with this product all along. With a small animal this is a great value and will last a long time - keep refrigerated if possible and remember to go slow to get them used to the extra fiber.,cats,2
"I have now owned this fountain for several years over 3 cats and have to say that it is still going strong. I originally purchased this fountain as I tend to spoil my cats. They originally had a regular stainless steal bowl which they would drink out of but they never really seemed to drink that much. When we initially got the Drinkwell the cats did not know what to do with it so we left both bowls available to them. It was not long until they all got use to the fountain and would not drink out of the standard bowl. I have noticed that they drink considerably more water now then with the original bowl as well, and we have never had any urinary track issues I believe because of this.The unit itself is a sturdy plastic. I would prefer a stainless steel or ceramic but do to the fact that all the parts snap together I think that would make a very expensive fountain. The pump work well and has had no issue in the 2+ years of almost constant operation. The noise that the pump makes is not to loud but can and does change pitch from time to time. Sometimes all you have to do is just push on the fountain and it will be quite again. To be honest I don't even notice the noise and have not since the first day or two of ownership. It is actually kind of relaxing like those water walls they have in hotel lobbies.Cleaning can be tedious but is not to bad. All the parts snap together and are easy to take apart. I try to clean it at least every other week. I take the whole unit apart and use a scrub brush and dish soap to give everything a good cleaning. I also take the pump apart and clean that thoroughly per the included instructions. This is important as even scrubbing the entire fountain clean, if the pump is not cleaned it will allow the mold/other nasty stuff to re-grow faster. After enough time it will grow faster and faster and you will have to clean the fountain more and replace the filters more. Plus you don't want to give your kitty bad water! This would take some time to happen but if you stay on it you never will have this issue.As mentioned previously the cats really like the fountain and prefer to drink from it. Do to the constant movement of the water , the water will stay cooler even in hot summer and will be oxygenated making the water taste better. This equals happy cats! I would defiantly buy this again in a heart beat and recommend it to everyone that has a furry friend that lives with them. While I only have cats I don't see any reason dogs would not love this too!",cats,2

"I'm glad I purchased this water dispenser for the sake of cleaner & aerated water for my cats. They were a little wary of the humming it produced, but I think their thirst overcame their apprehension. Eventually it just becomes another hum like the refrigerator or computer, blending into the background. I think since it's on my tile floor, I could place it on a small piece of thin dense foam (like the ones used in exercise routines) and the hum would be unnoticeable. With the added tank on the backside, the supply is ample, and I'm glad for the charcoal filters to rid their water of slime which was typical of their other water bowl that had stagnant water.

The video and instruction booklet are very easy to understand so don't worry about this too much.It is clear that my dog would rather not have the collar on, however he soon gives up caring because he is so happy that he is on a care free walk. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried obedience training methods to no avail and who would rather not use methods like choke or shock collars.",dogs,3

The price of the ultralight is considerably less, however. Works well on my pomeranian. Seems to give more of a buzz than a shock. Does not have correction levels like the old collar does.

It has 4 levels and it usually has to be put on level 4 to get my dogs attention. It is very unreliable. I would pay 200.00 for a shock collar that would always perform. The units collar and remote battery was DOA and I had to buy a new ones. I put the collar on my arm. You can hear the good/bad tone when you press the button but no shock on 1 or 2 and 3 is so mild until you get to level 4 it is useless. Level 4 will get your dogs attention as it will make him yelp with pain. If you get much beyond 20 to 50 feet it usually will not work. I would not buy this product again. My cars remote will work much farther than this collar.,dogs,3

"The only nice thing about this package is the fabric that goes over the crate. Even that is too small, but it works fairly well. The bumper pad only has tiny place to secure it to the crate, so it slides down and bunches up. The pad that goes at the bottom is way too small, and it bunches up whenever our dog moves around so he ends up just laying on the plastic crate. Very cheaply made, would not recommend. Would have been much better off continuing to use a sheet over the crate instead of wasting money on this.",dogs,3

"It irks me that cat litter made from corn can market itself as environmentally friendly, when we're already facing starvation in many parts of the world, and industrial agriculture is a serious contributor to climate change. I was happy to try a litter that doesn't use corn or nasty clay that's bad for my cat and me. Not only that, but the litter does the job better than any I've tried! No smell at all (after a few minutes) and the litter doesn't get tracked everywhere either. Great stuff.",cats,2

I have been giving these to my german shepherd for over a year. I have never had any issues with them. He loves them!

"Compared to the more expensive dog cooling bed (dont know if I can mention the brand here), this bed is not as good. You get what you pay for.

"We've had the furbinator for over a year now. Before I got the furbinator, we had a problem at home, because my sister is allergic to cats. We were not going to give the cats away, so it was something everyone had to live with. I can safely say with the furbinator we have created a somewhat of a controlled environment for the shedding. With good vacumming and Furbinating, our home is a much more peaceful place.The cats also love it. Especially if I they settle into a box or a sink, than you can furbinate them all you want with ease.",cats,2
"Since we spent almost $1000 on a vet bill for one of our cats, who had the cat form of kidney stones, we decided to try the Petmate bubbler to try to get them to drink more water. At first we thought it was great, easy to fill and not very noisy. After a while we noticed that the tube that provides the ""bubbles"" was becoming slimy and had white stuff inside. After pulling it completely appart and investing in pipe cleaners we were able to get most of the white stuff, a salt like substance, out of the tube. Every time we cleaned the bubbler we had to work on the white stuff, which required taking the tubing apart. After continually doing this for months one of the pieces of hard tubing broke so we took the flexible piece and hooked it to the piece that split the tube into 2 directions. Since the flexible piece was now running through the water it was getting slimy, and it was harder to clean than the other piece, so we would just cut off the end that was slimy and reattatch the freshly cut end. Because of this we had to buy more flexible tubing. We alse ended up having to replace the pump because the original one became very noisy. We have since given up on the bubbler and invested in a Cat It Fresh and Clear drinking fountain, which is much easier to clean and much quieter (unless it runs out of water).",cats,2

"I purchased this shampoo for my german shepherd dog. I wanted a shampoo that was going to be good for his skin and condition his coat at the same time. This product had excellent reviews, so I decided to give it a go. It arrived in a nice sealed bag inside of a cardboard box. Nice packaging. I first used the on my dog when he was only a few months old, and covered in mud. I put him in the tub and used a little bit on him. I really did not have to put too much on his coat to wash the mud off. The stuff just seemed to take the mud right off his coat. In addition to the great shampoo factor and the conditioning, this really left my dog smelling great. I wasn't sure if I would like the smell, but the lavender and mint really smells professional! I will definitely buy another bottle when I run out.Pros:*Smells Great!*Removes all kinds of dirt*Lasts a long time*Conditions the dogs coatCons:*There aren't any",cats,2
"I bought this at my local Petsmart as it was cheaper there and I even made sure that it said it would be safe for acrylic tanks.

Now our kids can walk her and she is a pleasure to take out and about. I definitely recommend this product to all dog owners!!!!",dogs,3
I have had this toy for three months. My big dog loves plastic bottles and will assume every water bottle is meant for her so I was curious about how this toy would go over. It was a definite hit! She loves it and ever after the beagle has tried to destroy it you can hardly see a mark on it! At least as far as dogs are concerned I think this might be indestructible.,dogs,3

It definitely keeps the pad in place and keeps messes from happening on the floor, but unfortunately once the pad is dry, it becomes a toy for my puppy.

"It is so hard to find a product of this type that works but since it worked for more people than average I thought I would give it a try. First off, the product itself feels very cheap. I followed all the directions for optimal placement, adjusted the different settings multiple times and still saw no results in the amount of barking. I wasn't expecting a product that was 100% effective but this didn't even make a dent in the problem.BUYER BEWARE ~ if you are thinking of trying out this product be sure of yourself. If it doesn't work for you either and you need to return it, the company charges a 15% restocking fee and makes you pay for all shipping . . . which almost makes it worth keeping the stupid thing as a paperweight rather than end up getting only a small portion of your money back.",dogs,3
"No cable is a permanent, but this one has done well for the past two months and looks like it will hold up for at least a few more with my dog. The mileage you get out of a tie out depends very much on your dog, their weight, how much they pull and the weather. 'Extreme' hot or cold can make the vinyl covering too soft or too brittle - exposing the cable and shortening the life of the tie out. So far, though, this cable is holding up with only a few cracks and continues to work great even after several days of sub zero temperatures.Pros:* The clips are sturdy, easy to use and work well.* The coating is holding up well to the cold and it's thick enough to resist kinking* The spring is kind to my dog's neck. As he's still a bit playful he occasionally forgets he's on it and tries to run after us or the local wildlife. The spring softens the reality that he's on a cable when he comes to the end of it.No negatives so far",dogs,3
"I bought this for my Cairn terrier for a stocking stuffer for christmas, it just showed up and I am shocked at its size. This toy is smaller then cat toys I have purchased! I am almost afraid to give it to her in fear or her swallowing it because it is that small. I would have expected this from the extra small size but not the small, but thats what I get for not reading the detail product dimensions. All in all, this toy is worth maybe $0.25 at best! It states that this is for dogs between 10-25 pounds, I would say it is for 10lbs and under and even that is pushing it.",dogs,3

This product probably works fine at larger levels but at the small the bottle neck is too narrow to allow anything but crumbs to come through. With this sized rope and the storage available in the bottle the product would work perfectly if it had a larger opening to allow dog to pull out treats. Sadly this is not the case.I'm hesitant to purchase a larger one as I worry the bottle neck-rope width issue will be just as present as it is in the small.,dogs,3

However, the heads of the screws that were included to attach the base are too big to ""sink"", so they protrude on the bottom.

I hope the manufacturer will quickly send new screws to replace these that do not go deep enough into the composite wood base!! Otherwise, sadly, it will have to go back. If you have carpeted floors, this may not be an issue for you.I will update if Amazon/manufacturer sends screws that fit better.",cats,2

Not available on Amazon. It is beautifully made with velvet lining on the chest strap. It is a lot easier to adjust and fit and in my opinion is a better design. It has the pull front ring on the chest and also a martingale pull ring on the back. I walked my dog in it and she did great. I am training my dog to heel and this harness makes it an easier job. For a few extra dollars the Freedom no pull harness is worth it.For those of you who like the Easy Walk Harness.

Big mistake! Within a week, both dogs had loose stools and one dog threw up twice. Back on they went and no problems since.",cats,2

The height provides plenty of room for them to streetch up high, it is so stable that they (we have two cats) jump up and hang off the side, and they love to play on it. I highly recommend it. The cats finally leave our furniture alone. It is tall, but we just tuck it in a closet if we're having a party. Otherwise it is out for them to play on all the time.We also got the little perch that goes on top and, though it took them a couple of weeks to understand they could get up there, they now snooze on there all the time!",cats,2

But no - neither one of our cats likes the Kong Zoom Groom anywhere near their stomach area. And they don't get all excited when they see me get the Zoom groom out either, like some other reviewers said theirs did. Ours just look at us like, &#34;Great, she's coming at me with that thing again...&#34; Maybe they put up with it a little bit better than when we try to groom them with other brushes?

"I bought this aquarium about 4 months ago for my beautiful male beta. The tank is nicely shaped and lightweight. Lighting system is decent, but I did switch the bulb to an LED (I have an LED fetish what can I say). The filter system left many things to be desired. It seems like half the water taken in just washes over top of the mechanical/ chemical rite-sized filter and the biowheel thing just acts like a water wheel nothing else. After three months of frustration, I gave up. I could never get this thing to go through the nitrogen cycle. Only one time did I ever get a reading that nitrites were present, but now I'm just thinking it was a false positive. I used cycle starter and I even took some bio media from my established tank but NO. From now on, this tank will be my quarantine tank for my new guys to hangout till they're ready to go in the big tank. LIVING with ammonia in the water is not living for my little buddies. I shake my fist at you biowheel.",fish aquatic pets,4
"We purchased the wireless pet fence this spring, and don't get me wrong; it worked great at first and the only problems we had were the boundaries being sketchy. It wouldn't shock when we put the collar on in the house, the next day it would. That was a bit of a pain, we never knew if it was going to be okay to put the collar on in the house or not. And it gave her the chance to roam free to a certain degree. Everything I read said that once the collar is out of range of the signal it would start shocking. Even read one review that said when they shut off the transmitter with the collar still turned on, it would shock (it's not recieving a signal so it shocks, obviously). So I was confused when she found out that at times, the perimiter would go a few feet farther than the edge of the house, and she could get in front of the house. And once in front, it blocked the signal and she wouldn't get shocked. And, if you live on top of a hill, once the dog goes down the hill away from the transmitter, it doesn't work, blocking the signal. So ultimately whether it just didn't work or the design flaws allowed to her get through and to the road, it ended in her getting hit by a car and dieing. I highly doubt she was getting shocked while in front of the house, she was less than 20lbs, and it was at the highest setting. (And I can't check at this point as the collar was destroyed when she was hit.) Yes she was persistant, but, if it can't keep a persistant 18lb dog in how would it ever keep a bigger dog whos just as persistant in? Don't get me wrong, if you put the transmitter in the house, and you have flat land with nothing remotely close to the perimeter/boundary, it would probably work well. But there are design flaws that could possibly jeopardize the life of your pet, and I think it should be known.",dogs,3
"I use this spray to clean up any hairballs (after picking up the main deposit of course), and I use it to clean out the litter box - once I have dumped the used litter and rinsed the box I spray it down with Nature's Miracle and then wipe clean with paper towels. I use the spray to keep litter boxes clean between full washings too, if a clump sticks to the side of the box I scrape off with the scoop and move litter away from that side, spray with NM and wipe clean with a paper towel, then smooth the litter back. It helps keep our litter boxes stink free, which is important if you want your cat to continue using it.I also had an incident when we first adopted our third cat, we had her separated from the others in our bedroom, but we did not know she didn't know how to use a litter box. We left her alone all day to allow her to settle in since she was very skittish, and when we checked on her the room stank - she had urinated and defecated on our bed. She didn't know any better, she had tried to cover it with the blankets. But what a mess! OUr mattress was a futon and the time and the urine soaked all the way through (she must have saved it up all day and then went). We stripped the covers and soaked them in the bathtub with some Nature's Miracle in water, and took the futon outside and poured the rest of the gallon of NM onto the urine spot. We alowed the futon to dry gradually as the NM instructions say. We soaked the bedding for a few hours then wrung it out and washed it in the washing machine - again adding Nature's Miracle to the wash. Thankfully, there was no remaining smell at all once the futon and the bedding were dry! I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell and I was able to continue sleeping on the futon (after 2 nights on the sofa while it dried!) and use the bedding. Importantly, our cats never sniffed around on the bed so they did not smell anything either.(By the way, we trained our kitty to use a litter box by putting dirt from outside in the litter - she'd been an outdoor stray cat so she was looking for ""dirt"" and the new litter box we got her smelled too clean! If only we'd known about Dr. Elsey's Cat Attract back then we would have used that.)Nature's Miracle breaks down the proteins in cats urine and feces that cause the smell, so it doesn't cover up the smell, and it doesn't try to ""shampoo out"" the smell like carpet cleaner would - you can never wash away that smell you have to attack it at the molecular level with nature's own way of breaking down proteins. It works!",dogs,3

"I bought the Marineland Eclipse 12 aquarium unit a few months ago. I've kept fish for over 30 years, but thought it would be easier to set up a new tank with the hood and filter attached. Unfortunately, I've not been pleased with this tank. I will say that when I check my ammonia levels that they are generally good and so the biowheel and filter must be doing their job. However, working in the tank itself is VERY difficult because the filter apparatus is in the way. Also, my filter suddenly stopped working and so I guess the biowheel won't be doing its job now will it? I've only had this tank for a few months and the filter must not be very good if is stops working.

"This shampoo was recommended to us by our dog trainer and we love it. It leaves our Bernese Mountain dogs smelling pretty for weeks after their baths.

"We have an indoor kitten. We don't want to live with ordinary litter box in our guest bathroom, as it is quite tiny. We went online and found this piece of furniture/cat washroom. At first we are not totally convinced that it will do the trick but willing to give a try since we have no other solution. It works great. Our cat loves it, used it right away after we move the litter box inside. Our friends come to visit and saw it, wanted to know where to buy it... we think this is a brilliant idea to hide the litter box. Plus, it matches our kitchen cabinet! What else to ask for....",cats,2

"I take in,rescue,re-home,rehabilitate and adopt out parrots - in particular the larger white cockatoos. On occasion I get in a bird with less than normal feathering and these perches make sure they stay nice and warm,although it rarely is very cold here in South Florida.I believe the ones giving this item a low score are the ones who allow their birds access to the wires while playing outside their cage,something this design was not intended for. No birds should have access to any kind of wire at any time! I certainly do hope I have educated my adopters to be smarter bird keepers than to do this,sooner or later these birds will get harmed.I have not used these perches for the largest of the 'Toos such as The U2 or M2,but have not had any problem with the quality of the plastic when used in cages holding SC2's,G2's,African Greys or Macaws.They should - as every item used in a bird environment - be checked for cracks or other sources of potential failure frequently,to avoid harm to the birds.I found the small size to work fine with birds of all sizes as long as it is not used as the birds' main perching spot. If used every day/night there must be other perching options in the cage,preferably made out of a variety of materials such as both hard and soft woods and rope,on different levels and in different areas of the cage.I would buy this again and have already recommended this item for others to purchase and use.",birds,0

Our Springer Spaniel Alex has had skin allergies on his abdomen for approx. 1 yr. Dry skin came along with it also.A combination of meds from the veterinarian alone did not help.

"I was so pumped for this thing! Day one, I woke up to find happy, fed rabbits who finally left me alone while I slept in. Day two, I set it out at night for the following morning. Barely a couple minutes later I heard a noise, looked over, and saw them happily munching away on lettuce. Oh no! I must have not pushed the lid down and set it right.So I reset it, jostled it a bit to make sure it was secure, and set it back down. A minute later, there they were again breaking into the next day's breakfast. I bought the 2 meal version and each tray has a lip that extends down front from under the lid. All they need to do is jimmy that a bit and it pulls right out from the lid. See the user photo with the cat demonstrating to you what your pet will do. If they haven't figured it out yet, it's only a matter of time. Completely useless. My trusty UPS guy came by yesterday with my label to return it. I hope I can find a version of this that actually does its job.",cats,2
"Reading the reviews I was thinking that finally I could buy a toy for my dog that he wouldn't rip up quickly. I even watched the video on this ad, and it all looked so beautiful and made sense. Then the toy came in the mail from Amazon. My dog had no interest in taking the eggs out. He was more interested in making his way to the stuffing inside the Platypus, and proceeded to rip apart the animal- and within 5 minutes the stuffing was pulled out all over the place. My dog, is a sweet 22 lb Cockapoo, a therapy dog, who is gentle and sweet- but just loves taking out the stuffing from toys. Anyway- lesson be learned...a strong chewer will always be a strong chewer. Buyer Beware!",dogs,3

"I love this thing and so does my 17 pound mutt. He took it over from my 65 pound mutt for which I bought this bed. I only gave it 3 stars because you have to take it a laundromat in order to wash it. This bed is so big, to have to lug it out of the house is cumbersome and inconvenient. It would be so much easier if you could take it apart and just wash it at home.",dogs,3
"I wish we had had this collar for our last dog. She was LARGE and STRONG and if she pulled while on a walk there was no stopping her. After starting a family, we ended up giving her away because she was just too much to handle with babies in the house.Now, however, we've rescued another large dog. While he's a bit older (9 years) he can still drag me across the street if he wanted to. So, after recommendations from friends and researching the product, we ordered the Gentle Leader. This thing is great! Any tugging is quickly put to an end, since the act of pulling will turn the dog's head back toward you. He learned quickly what would happen if he pulled, and rarely does anymore. If he gets excited about another dog or anything else while on a walk, a few soft tugs will get his attention and help him refocus. Honestly, there is little to no force needed to redirect his attention. Such a wonderful product for powerful dogs who like to pull on the leash. I can't say that it would work for every dog or every temperament. But if you have a problem with your dog pulling while on the leash, I would recommend giving the Gentle Leader a try. It's reasonably priced and you can hook any leash to it.",dogs,3
This product gets rid of the worms without the costly vet bill! I notice an adult round worm in my puppy's stool. I ran to the store and bought this product until I could get to the vet. I took a stool sample into the vet 2 days later and it was negative for worms! My puppy took it easily. I would recommend this product! I am going to have my puppy take it again in two weeks. I hear that the product only gets the adult worms and not the eggs. I want to make sure they do not come back!,dogs,3

"I found this product to be satisfactory but only a short term solution. I recently purchased a new couch and wanted to prevent my cats from ripping it to shreds like the previous one. I bought 2 packages of these and they did deter my cats, but ultimately I went through both packs in the course of a month. They didn't adhere very tightly to the microfiber, so after a while they would start to bunch up and get stuck to themselves. Additionally, one of my cats has a weird tape thing...meaning she likes to chew it...so she would start chewing these as them came off the couch. I also found that my robe would get stuck to them if I walked by the couch too closely. So they worked...whenever they were actually attached to the furniture!That said, my cats now use the previously unused scratching post, so it did seem to ultimately change their behavior for the better in conjunction with my loud noises and spray bottle. I did get them a rather large cat tree around the same time as the couch in hopes that would help so that may have contributed to their lack of interest in the couch. I'm still not sure they would never try to scratch again though, I ended up buying some clear vinyl covers for the couch edges moving forward just in case since these aren't a good option long term.",cats,2
"There's no doubt that this shampoo has provided my dog with some much needed relief. It does smell very good and it kills a lot of fleas. We've really had a hard time with the bugs this early winter but I think we're starting to see a decline in them. Between this shampoo, Frontline earlier in the battle, flea traps, and a lot of vacuuming and washing I think we're starting to take the upper hand. This stuff probably isn't going to do the job alone but it is a great weapon in an arsenal you'll have to deploy to defeat those nasty creatures.",cats,2

The technique paid off big time when the doodle came home. It's been washed twice since then and does well.,dogs,3

"I have a new cat, a rescue, and for the first few week he was great about the litter box. But then, while he still peed in the box, he started pooping on the rugs.What to do, what to do.Well, I went online to see what to try, and tried several ideas. He is a pretty big boy, so I got him a new larger box, actually a storage box. Changed to an unscented litter. Tried having two boxes, since I read some cat like to pee in one and poop in the other.No good.So, I tries the 'cat attract'. Sprinkled some on each box as directed.First night, no good.Second night, SUCCESS!And so it has continued, fingers crossed. A d he does use both boxes, the new big one to peed in and the smaller, old one to poop. No idea why, but if that is what it takes, so be it. It is not cheap, and hopefully once he gets the idea I will not need to keep adding it with new litter, but so far it seems to work for my Larry.",cats,2

"my cat was having urinary tract problems, so i did everything i could think of to encourage him to drink more. this fountain did absolutely NOTHING to encourage him to drink. in fact, he was more scared by the sound the reservoir made when he drank the water down to where it needed refilling than anything.i found the fountain to be difficult to place on the ground once full. i always made a mess! also, there are so many pieces to take apart and clean that it required a good ten minutes to accomplish. if your cats are like mine and love to get food, litter, or some other foreign objects in their water on a daily basis, you don't have time for this. i decided to go back to a plain old bowl so that i can pick it up and rinse it out on a daily basis. if kitty isn't committed to keeping objects out of his water bowl, this fountain isn't going to do anything to keep the water cleaner, despite the filter! stuff settles in the basin, and you still have to clean!",cats,2

"I purchased the Super Feeder after going through 3 of the LeBistro cat feeders in less than one year. At $70 a pop, that irritated me. My cat is very aggressive when it comes to sticking his paw up the chute and he broke the flimsy plastic rotators inside. I decided on the Super Feeder after about a month of research, reading reviews, and mulling it over.I know this feeder is expensive, but endlessly buying other feeders is far worse. Here are my top reasons to buy this if you have a determined, hungry cat.1. It is absolutely ""theft proof"". My cat is finally defeated.2. You can customize it to dispense virtually any volume of feed and up to 8 meals, including small snacks. We use Science Diet Weight Control and it dispenses perfectly. You can also adjust the roller for bigger kibbles.3. You can pole/post mount it. Get as creative as you want!4. You can buy any internal or external replacement part you need if something ever gives out. Fair prices, too.5. Great customer service. I was emailed back within minutes with answers to my questions.6. American made! American made! No junk from overseas.7. Simply put, this thing rocks. No regrets after several months.Edit.....12/30/12I thought I'd pop back and report that this thing is still working flawlessly. It has been about a year and no problems to report. Cat is still defeated. Take that, cat!",cats,2
"I wanted to find something for my dog (85 lb. Boxer) that was like a zhu zhu pet because he LOVES those, but they are too dangerous for me to let him play with when I'm not around. I was hoping that this toy would last a little bit longer than it did. He loves the noises, but it was broken in 2 days. It was delivered Thursday and today is Friday - not great. First the monkey noises got quieter, now they've disappeared all together. Because it's inexpensive and he loves it so much, I'll probably buy more. That said, yes, he breaks every squeaky thing he comes in contact with. So, if your dog is not big on just gnawing on something, maybe the noises will last longer. He loves the noises part of it, so it's disappointing. I think the toy is genius, I really do. It's like a kid toy. But, there has to be some way to put the noise box in that makes it more durable.But, yes, I'll be buying more, probably, because he loves it.",dogs,3

Perhaps if you lined it with thick plastic you could get more life out it.Many of the parts that appeared to be solid wood are disintegrating and revealing themselves to be MDF or something of that ilk.It did originally look better than most competitive products we have tried.Now it is just falling apart.Looks like it is back to plastic for us.Best of luck in your quest for a stealth litter tray.",cats,2

He used to run to the door and hit the bells to go outside, now he cringes when I want to take him out and will even hide so I can't take him out. When putting it on him, he will stretch his nose upward extending his neck so I have a difficult time closing it. once it is on he seems fine. He does not try to rub it off and he walks great with it. We have been going on nice long walks and he seems to enjoy them. I have mixed feelings about it though. I love how easy it is to walk with him now, but really wish he didn't hate it so much. I'm almost afraid it will affect his house breaking.",dogs,3

"I ordered this power filter for a 35 gallon fish aquarium. It seems to be filtering out most of the waste pretty well. The instructions were difficult to follow, and I think I would have been better off to just put it together using common sense. My only complaint is about the extension tube and how it ""connects"" to the motor. The lid has an slot that allows you to adjust the flow speed of the water by sliding the extension tube from one point to another. Being a smaller aquarium, I like to adjust the flow speed as low as possible. When doing this I start to notice a vibration after a few hours of use. It's really annoying and I have finally given up on adjusting the flow speed down, as I'm sick of going over and moving it around to stop the noise. Other than that I have no complaints.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This filter worked like a charm when I first got, and then once I turned it off it wouldn't start back up. This filter is really hard to work with, sometimes you need to add more water to your aquarium to start it up, and sometimes it just won't start up at all. It isn't worth the money. Save up, and buy something better you won't regret it.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I bought one of these for my two Himalayan cats last summer. I've been SO pleased because they drink at least 3-4 times as much water as they did out of a bowl. Being males and possibly prone to UTI's I feel much better about their water intake, especially since they are dry kibble addicts. Last week I made the mistake of putting the housing parts into the dishwasher, but dummy that I am put them on the bottom rack.

Even when it was working, you'd still have to go down every day and make sure it wasn't caught. The comb that goes through isn't long enough, so sometimes it would pass right over larger clumps. Still nicer than cleaning it by hand though, and being able to dump it right into that little plastic container helped the smell a LOT. Filling it fuller than the line suggests helped a little. Unfortunately, I couldn't find my receipt, so neither PetCo nor LitterMaid would help me when it broke.",cats,2

"The Eclipse Hex 5 is an elegant solution for those who want a very small aquarium to place in a very small space. The in-hoo filter and lght keeps things simple. The system is quiet and works great.But the Hex 5 also has some previously unmentioned design features which are of interest:1. The Filter and Light are on separate power cords.This is a great idea so that you dont have to shut off the light and the filter at the same time, I was worried about this but they cam through!2. The Filter medium can't go anaerobic when shut off.The filter system is an overflow design which exposes the filter to air on all sides. It's not encased in a cannister so it cannot go anaerobic when the filter is turned off. This is important for those who don't want to run the filter all the time.3. Bright light for your plants.The tank hood has a built in 20 watt CF fixture, (4 watts/gal.) so even though the tank is tall and narrow your plants will get plenty of light even at the bottom.4. Little surface agitation.At least when used without the biowheel. this is important for those keepling planted aquaria and trying to preserve the CO2 level.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I buy lots of things through Amazon and for the most part, I'm usually satisfied. However, this has got to be the worst piece of garbage they've sold me to date. I purchased one of these last year from a local pond supply store here on Long Island, N.Y., and it got me through the Winter of 2011. Sounds good but considering it hardly snowed or got very cold last Winter, it's also not saying much. When I placed it into my pond this past December, I noticed it was not working and in fact, the plastic housing began to melt before my eyes. At this point, I removed it from my pond and ordered a new one through Amazon...same manufacturer and model number. I received it the first week in January 2013 and installed it immediately. It apeared to work O.K. for the first few weeks but that's not saying much since there was only a very thin layer (1/4&#34;) of ice on the pond each morning during that time. On February 8, we were hit with a pretty intense snow storm that left about two feet of snow on the ground. The next day, I went out to the pond and brushed the snow away to find the De-icer inoperative and frozen in a 2-3 inch layer of ice. I checked the ground fault outlet and it was working but the heater was not. Now that most of the ice has melted a few days later, I removed the De-icer and noticed the unit has a crack in the plastic housing. Unfortunately for me, I'm about a week beyond the Amazon return policy date so I'll have to write this one off as a total loss and purchase something else quickly before my Koi start dropping like flies. .

"I read one review that the resevoir won't stand up by itself. People, that's why you have hands. :)This thing is perfect. I have 4 cats and a little dog. They definitely drink more water with this than any bowl I've had. The water keeps moving and therefore remains fresh due to the filter. I just cleaned it after a week of having it and it was a breeze. It took maybe 5 minutes. Just disassemble the entire unit, wash, reassemble.There is a slight sound of trickling water, but it's actually kind of calming. It doesn't sound like a faucet running or anything.Obviously, we love it. Make sure you put a rubber mat under it, though, so when you carefully turn over the resevoir, any slight leaking will be caught.Enjoy!",cats,2
Top quality and a grate price! It made the dog vary happy and she enjoyed the clipping vary much. The old clipper did not have enough power.,cats,2
My dog had puppies and they are large outside dogs. I put them in the barn with a heat lamp but it wasn't enough. The puppies lay on the snuggle safe all night. It does stay warm for 12 hours so i only have to heat it twice a day. I want one!,cats,2

"FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch EdgeWho ever invented this, did a fantastic job. This is my second one and it really works. The ads are not a come on.

I fist purchased K&H; Lectro Kennel pet heaters at the local pet store and I asked them if they would be getting any more this year.They really didn't know so I went on line and found that Amazon had them. I've purchased other things from thiscompany and found them to be very wonderful getting the products to you in a very short time. I ordered 2 of theheat pads for my cats (which they love) and was surprised that I received them so quickly. I will be orderingat least 2 more so all of my cats will have their very own heating pads for a place to get warm and comfy for theirnaps. Thanks Amazon - keep up the wonderful quality of your products and timely getting them to the customers.Sally,dogs,3
"My big puppies Cooper and Ellie received this ball as a gift from their ""grandma"" and have had great fun with it ever since! My brother's dog is also a big fan of this toy. Cooper pushes the ball all over the floor with his nose until a treat falls out, then scoops it up before Ellie can get it, grabs the ball in his mouth, moves to another spot and tries again. I've read some negative reviews on this ball which I was surprised at. We put 10-12 half inch size treats (Nutro Natural treats are the favorite) in the ball and the puppies are entertained until all the treats are gone! We are buying another one as a present for a friend's dog who loves to play with the ball when she visits!",dogs,3
"I needed a spill-proof bowl for a road trip, and I had seen one in a pet store before with a lip on the edge, that prevented sloshing water from spilling over the edge. They had none left, in stock, so I got this one instead. BAD DECISION. Any time you start up or stop, water sloshes over the edge. My carpeting has never been so wet. AND, it leaks around the cap also. If you screw it down a little to tight, it leaks around the O-ring. If a little to loose, it also leaks around the O-ring. I ordered a Buddy Bowl to replace this, and it's perfect. Not only does it have a lot more water in the bottom of the bowl so the dog doesn't have to wait after every lap for the bowl to fill up, you can be a speed racer and the water won't slosh out because of the rim.",dogs,3

"When my sister recommended that I buy a Furminator to deshed my two Siberian Huskies, I never believed that it could do better than my old wire dog brush. However, the Furminator is fantastic -- and better than anything I've ever used! You just use it like a brush, but it gets out tons of underfur. Two recommendations -- if you have big hairy dogs, you might go outside on your first use. It gets out SO much fur that you might not want to be in your house on the first use. Second, if you have a big dog, get the 4-inch FURminator. It is a really terrific tool!",cats,2
"We bought the Drinkwell Platinum loved it, but when we got the lab we had to move up in the size. Gator was gulping it down and the Platinum couldn't keep up. Whether you have a large dog or multiple dogs this is the fountain for you. The large resevoir is great for large dogs or a household with multiple pets. Love this item",dogs,3
"Was surprised how much fur came out of my Sheltie. She's already well groomed but has excess fur on what we call her ""pants"" around the back side and tail. The tool really worked through this difficult area and pulled tons of fur out. That being said, she didn't like it and think it wasn't comfortable for her even while trying to be gentle. We took breaks and did a little at a time. Pulling fur out is still ripping fur out so you need to be careful. Not using the jaws of death either- the regular tool was extreme enough and didn't want to torture her.",dogs,3
"I love this crate. I was using a lifestyle crate and this is just like it but lighter. I did not need a heavy duty one as I set it up and leave it and when I am done, it will be cleaned and folded up and stored.

"Purchased this for my 92 year old mother to use on her cats. She hasn't even tried it because she's afraid she'll injure them based on all of the warnings inside the packaging. Can't use it if the hair is tangled, pets may suffer brush burns even with gentle use. We wanted to return it but, as with all plastic packaging, it was impossible to get the item out without damaging the package. Might work well but would like to have seen some of the warnings before opening the package.",cats,2
"I have a 30 lb Aussie who is playful but gentle with her toys. I've never seen her so joyful as when she interacted with this toy; I think she regarded it as the best playmate she'd ever had. LOL. Sadly, the ""babble"" component of this ball quit working after just a few days. I tried replacing the batteries hoping that was the problem (battery replacement is easy to do but expensive, btw). No luck. I can hear something broken/ rattling inside the ball. Normally I would not replace a product that breaks so quickly. However, my little dog has been laying around depressed since the babbling stopped, so I'm going to order another and hope the new one lasts.",dogs,3
"One of our cats really loves to chase the jingly balls. Unfortunately, she would lose most of them under various bits of furniture within a day. This toy lets both of them bat around a ball all day if they so wish. The scratcher is also a great furniture saver. They used to sharpen their claws on the post and on the wicker. Now they just use the post and the cardboard scratcher. Your cats may vary. The cardboard scratch pad seems to last a decent amount of time. Each side seems to last a little over a month with two cats.",cats,2
"My cat has a very thick coat and often despite the fact that I brush with a mitten, I still see tufts of hair hanging around. Sometimes if there was a knot I used another type of cat brush to get it. I just got the FURminator in the mail today so I can't speak for what it will do for my apt cat hair situation weeks ago but I can say how amazing it is right now!My cat has also loved to be brushed so he didn't mind the new tool. He laid down in front of me purring while I used the deshedding tool. It really brought up a lot of hair (like enough to cover the other kitten I have) without much of a mess. I tried it on my kitten but he hadn't be brushed before, ever so he wasn't so sure of it but that isn't to say in the future he won't like it.Yes I had a plastic bag ready to pull the hair off and keep going but it was nothing of a mess compared other tools I have used. It was so easy to clean as well. The hair came off the tool extremely fast and easy which makes for easy storage. The mitten I had to store in a bag so that the cat hair I couldn't get off wouldn't hang around.Is it perfect? No, there is still some hair that is left over on the cat that I couldn't get but you will have that with anything. Despite that I would buy it again - it is worth the price.If you have a cat and a hair problem- this product is worth a try for you :)",cats,2
"I bought Richard's Organics Pet Calm for our Yorkie to calm her down when we travel. My husband and I are long haul truck drivers and at first our youngest Yorkie was okay traveling over the road. However, when we travel over rough roads (and there are a lot of rough roads out there) she starts to pant and shake. She will take Richard's Organics Pet Calm readily enough (it has a sweet taste to it) and does get that ""sleepy eyed"" look, but I didn't see enough of a calming reaction to justify buying it again. However, I haven't tried it under ""normal"" stress circumstances, such as at home during a thunderstorm. I think that for milder stress situations, that Richard's Organics Pet Calm might work.",dogs,3

But that was easy to fix.As for the person whose 9-lb. dog ate through it -- that is quite a feat. I suppose if your dog has reinforced jaws and titanium teeth, this might be possible, but there are cross bars on the the sides if the little piranha can chew through the incredibly tough vinyl. I can't imagine it - perhaps the company came out with a new model after that happened, I don't know. All I know is, I couldn't cut through that stuff with a knife so...",dogs,3

My dogs all love it and lick the bowls clean, since I put it on the bottom of the food bowls,they actually dig for it.I know for certain that my 18 and 19 year old dogs did so much better in the last few years of their lives because of it, and I now give it to my bassets to make them comfortable. Two were on perscribed medication which was difficult on their liver, but have done so much better, act like pups, since switching over to Gold.So thank you NaturVet for the fountain of youth for my pups!",dogs,3
"We got this for our Dachshund and it appears to be very sturdy. If you move it, the legs will twist a little so it is not quite level. However, this can be easily and quickly adjusted. This is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.The bed is a little bigger than I anticipated, so you may want a smaller one if you have a Shihtzu, Dachshund, Schnauzer, etc. My little Pluto gets on it easily and watches his squirrels as he sunbathes. I have already bought a replacement cover, as I was worried one might not be available in 2 years, like with the last outdoor pet bed we bought. Although they are good quality, I doubt any fabric that is comfortable enough to lie on can withstand summer sun and winter ice for too long. The blue is the nicest color in my opinion, but I could only get the replacement in green.",cats,2

"We have two cats that are somewhat petite. Their waste looks pretty normal, but somehow much of it just finds its way through the tines of the rake and remains behind in the box and gets dragged around. I've read that this product doesn't work for cats that don't burry their poo. I have to agree and would be surprised if it worked even if they did burry them.To watch this unit slide the solid waste all the way to the end and then watch the waste slip down back into box rather than get flipped into the bin was frustrating. Watching the waste that slipped though the gap get raked backwards all the way the start and seeing it pinned against the wall was just plain grose! And we turned the unit on manually a good hour after they did their business. There was no reason for it not work. I even ran it three times in a row and it just could pick them all up and actually made matters a little worse each time, ending with the stuff pinned all the way back behind the rakes up against the wall.The tines of the rake are just too short and too flimsy. Why else would solid waste nearly make it up into the bin and drop back down into the litter? After all the years this product has been in existence I'm shocked to see it perform as it does. This unit was returned.I said at first that I was done with this brand, but I have to now retract that statment! I took a chance on the more expensive LitterMaid ELITE MegaLitterMaid Elite LME9000 Mega Advanced Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Boxbecause I wasn't interested in buying the $20 crystal trays that went with an alternate brandScoop Free LB1 Self-Cleaning Litter Boxand I could tell by looking that it was much better made. I'll probably post a separate review but I can tell you that the ELITE Mega has a superior design and so far nothing has slipped past the rake or even gotten stuck.I maintain that the LM 600 is not even worth trying unless perhaps your cat has enormous sized droppings. I personally wouldn't consider any of them that had a flimsy plastic rake, especially now that I've seen the metal rake actually work as one would expect.",dogs,3

"We would prefer not having to crate our pup at all but his energy and mischievous nature gave us no options. He does really well. We've tried other kennels. He either chewed them in a short period of time or outgrew them. He loves his new abode. Sturdy, roomy, easy to wipe down...a quality product. If I had one complaint it would be that the tray on the bottom of the cage moves when the pup steps out. It needs to fit a little more snug. It causes our pup to second guess getting in and out. One suggestion would be to sell a cover for it. Blocking out noise and light could be helpful. Overall very pleased.",dogs,3
"Our 1 year old bassett/bulldog puppy played with this toy for 2 hours straight, the day we got it. She chews a lot and it's hard to find toys that keep her attention. This toy has been great! We put the rawhides on every few days. It keeps the toy interesting. She is getting much faster at eating the rawhide or unscrewing the end of the bone to get it off, but it's still a fun toy for her. It is heavy and good quality, even though she has bite marks on the bone ends. I don't mind buying the replacement rawhides, because it's extending the use of this toy.",dogs,3
"This transaction went well but the scooper is not my favorite. Well made, but the tines are too far apart. They pick up after the basset hounds but not the chihuahua. The little poops just fall through. It's very frustrating! Plus, I'm not crazy about the angle of the whole thing. It makes it hard to dump the poops into a plastic bag. I'll keep looking.",dogs,3
"Timothy Complete is an excellent food for adult rabbits. Adult rabbits should not have alfalfa as a main ingredient in their pellets, the protein level is too high. When I switched my rabbits from an alfalfa based diet to Timothy Complete at the suggestion of my vet, my mini-lop no longer had messy poops! The vet told me the high levels of protein in alfalfa caused the digestive upset.Remember to also give your rabbit unlimited access to Timothy hay and fresh vegtables each day.",small animals,5

"I bought this only about a week ago, so my feedback is limited. However, it works. After slightly tedious but commonsense programming, I have it set up to feed our two cats 8 times a day, in small amounts that they (hopefully, and so far so good) won't throw up. At the proper times, a small amount of food clatters into the bowl, and the cats usually notice the sound and run to grab what they can. However, our cats are feisty! Within 10 minutes of setting it up, one cat got the whole device knocked over, which stops the food from coming out, among other things. The company also said this might break the augur device that delivers the food out the tube. (And while I'm talking about the tube, note that even with the smallest unit, there is now a longish tube that keeps the cats from fishing up the tube with their paws to get extra food out.) So, my first alteration of the unit was to attach fishing line around the base and through the kitchen closet door hinge, which keeps the unit upright no matter what the cats do. But it prevents getting into the closet, so it will need a better solution. Second, the cats don't share very well. Therefore, with the one bowl, there is only one cat getting all the food unless I intervene. Since my getting to do something else at feeding time was the point in buying this unit, I am having a handyman come and cut out two sides of the plastic bowl with an electric saw (alteration number two) so the food will be available to the less aggressive cat. Otherwise, when I go away, he will end up starving. If these alterations end up working, I will be happy. I only will wish there were a small bell that would be programmable for the cat who is getting deaf, so he would know the food is about to be delivered! Because the electronic timer is practically silent, only the sound of the food itself falling into the bowl part can be heard for the deafer cat if he is within range. Maybe they will eventually know and memorize the times that food is coming.",cats,2

"[...]Well, I have had this product for about six months now and have actual experience, so read on [...]A friend gave me a couple of goldfish in one of those one-gallon jars that you'd see at a carnival. So although I knew this tank would be a little small, at least it would be better than that! Upon receiving this tank, I also purchased a few minnows and an algae-eater. Unlike the messages from the flood of PETA-esque negative reviews that have suddenly popped up, my fish have been in this tank for a while now, seem happy, and I haven't lost one yet. There has been no ammonia build-up... there has been no death-by-nitrates... the fish have shown no signs of stress, nor have they died from it.HOWEVER...1. The tank itself is made of plastic, not glass. So where they get the price tag on this is anybody's guess as there's no way that there was $120 worth of product and workmanship on this item (the glue stains on the side would attest to that).2. After a couple of months or so, the tank started to bow in the middle due to the fact that this cheap plastic is holding all of this water weight and eventually starts to buck under the pressure. This has been a MAJOR cause for concern as I'm not sure as to whether or not my tank is suddenly going to explode open and kill everything in it.3. There are two small rings in the middle that I can only suppose is there for giving the tank extra support. Therefore, I used some wire to connect these rings and essentially tie down the middle to prevent the bowing. Unfortunately, these rings are made of the same cheap plastic as the tank, so one ring broke within a week and now the tank bowes more than ever!4. The ACTUAL INTERNAL DIMENSION of the tank (just verified with a ruler) is 20 1/2 inches wide by 13 1/2 inches high by 2 1/2 inches deep! Granted the middle of my tank is now 3 1/2 inches deep, but that's only because it's BOWED IN THE MIDDLE BY NEARLY 50% from the pressure of making the mistake of putting water in it.5. The frame itself (which is what I guess the stated dimensions are based on) is also cheap plastic that you hang from the sides of the tank. You're supposed to snap these pieces into each other, but they don't quite fit both the tank and each other at the same time, so in the end, you have dangling plastic for effect.6. Plan on placing this close to an electrical outlet as the cords are very short and thick. This makes for unsightly huge white and black cords going down your walls (although we've simply painted the cords the same color as the wall as a solution).Bottom Line - We have cats that get at any other type of aquarium, so we figured that having one on the wall and out of their reach would be a nice compromise and if you have small enough fish (and not too many of them), then the dimensions should be fine (despite the cruelty-towards-animals comments below). HOWEVER, note that the actual aquarium dimensions are much smaller than what is advertised for the whole product and that, because it is made of plastic, even though it'll look fine, in six months you'll most likely find yourself in the same situation that I'm in now... out money and having to go get a different aquarium because of this junk.",fish aquatic pets,4
"After I put it away (on the top shelf of the tv cabinet) my cat spends hours looking forlornly up at the top of the cabinet.

"I received this stroller about a week ago and set it up right away (the instructions were pretty clear)- I have 2 kittens ages 16 and 18 weeks and they run and jump into it with out it even wobbling. I set it up and they were curious but a little afraid so I started feeding them treats in it and giving them lots of love while they are in it. Now they jump up into it when they want a treat and take their kitty naps in it. I've zipped it up a few times with no problem and even wheeled it around the house with no howling (lol)- they are Egyptian Maus and we only got them a day or two before we got the stroller so they are still getting use to a lot of new stimuli. But I have never had a problem with tipping or being unsteady - even with them walking around while I'm pushing the stroller. I do wish there was more than on restraint but I'll have to rig something to restrain them both while in the stroller while taking them for walks. I love it and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a stroller for their pet, be it a cat, dog or even a bird (we've thought of using it for our bird).",cats,2

"I was so excited to find the one toy that our dog dearly loves. I found it by going to hartz, searched through the pictures, and clicked on the picture that was an identical match to what he had for many years. He has a boxful of toys, but when we say ""go get your toy"", he only goes to this one particular toy. A few days later, I read the confirmation of the order and that a toy selected from an assortment was being shipped. That is not what I wanted. I even called them on the phone and told them that I was willing to buy a second toy if that toy was the exact copy of what I thought I was ordering. The semi-rude lady from customer service seemed to care less if the customer was happy with his order or not, and that they would not hand select the toy that I wanted to order. On Christmas, I helped the dog to unwrap his toy, squeaked it a couple of times, and tossed it in the air for the dog. The dog was sitting on the couch and just watched it bounce on the floor and never made an effort to jump down to play with it. To this day he has not shown any interest in it. The dog is smart enough to know an inferior product when he sees one. The only way anyone can make me happy (and the dog) is to send the exact toy that I ordered.",dogs,3

My cat is actually always laying on top of the third floor &#34;condo&#34; and he seems to love it up there which is the only reason I even give it one star. He's never touched the hamock and the sisal posts are already starting to unravel after two weeks worth of scratching.The worst cat tree I've ever seen.

I was hopeful when I read the reviews that my two 30 pd dogs wouldn't chew through these immediately. Unfortunately they disemboweled them really quickly and got the squeakers out. So if your dogs are major chewers like mine they will chew right through this in 15 minutes or so.,dogs,3

Get this if your dog likes the feel of wind in her face....mine likes to hide under my shirt.",dogs,3
"The EHEIM Classic filter is a great filter. Had a bit of trouble with the clips falling off when the filter was not on and not under pressure, but once it's up and running it worked like a charm. No leaks have been noted, not a single noise from the filter, often I wonder if its on! I would recommend this filter if you need a canister filter, its cheap and work great!",fish aquatic pets,4

"I have a 6 year old Doberman who is UNBELIEVABLY picky about her food. She would rather go hungry than eat most dog foods - literally, if I try to change her food, she'll refuse to eat. I've used other Nutro products (ONLY various dry foods) before and whe enjoys those as well. I have even reviewed some of the others.About a year ago, I came across this specific product when they were out of the Nutro I normally purchase for her. I brought it home concerned she'd turn her nose up at this as well, but I was stunned when she just went right to it and completely cleaned her bowl. She never does this. It's always a battle to get her to eat, but not with this food. Of course, she would pick one of the most expensive dog foods out there, but if it makes her happy I'm happy.Ultra cuts down on the amount of waste that she leaves outside, which is great because my yard isn't that big. The food obviously tastes good to her. It also cuts way down on her shedding. Her coat is now very shiny and extremely soft. When people see her, they always think she's just been groomed. So far (I've been using it for about a year,) she's maintained her ideal weight as well as plenty of muscle tone. It keeps her energetic without becoming hyper.My doberman is my baby and completely spoiled. I take no chances with her health and well-being. At this point, I've been nothing but thrilled with the results I've gotten from feeding her Nutro Ultra, and to me that's worth the price.My advice, try one of the small 4.5lb bags first. I started to notice a difference in her coat, stool, and energy level in about a week. A small bag SHOULD be enough to see if it's going to work for your dog or not.***NOTE*** FDA RECALL OF NUTRO PET FOOD - APRIL 2009After the hundreds of pet illnesses and deaths attributed to Nutro's canned food in North America, I permanently changed her food to Blue Buffalo. I have a new review posted of that product. I no long recommend ANY Nutro product, nor do I have any plans to purchase anything they produce in the future.",dogs,3
We have a 1 year old male shih-tzu. He absolutely loves his car seat. It took him about 15 mins to get comfortable in it. He is a very well behaved dog so there is no need to use the harness strap. If I tell him to hold on he crouches down and the seat holds him securely. I found the harness to restrict him and he couldnt get comfortable.,dogs,3

"We have 2 Border Terriers, and we've never used the chemical products like Frontline on them. We live in the Northeast so of course ticks are a concern, but I wanted to avoid exposing them or us to poison. I've been using Flea Free for 7 years with success, and want to ensure this great product continues to be available...which is what motivated me to write a review. We've never had fleas or ticks on our dogs. I put 1/4 t in my 10 lb's food and 1/2 t in the 20 lb's food once a day. (Yes, they are both out of the breed standard...our girl was smallest of a large litter, and our boy was the largest of a small litter.) In the past, I've only used it during the warm months when these pests are active; however, I'm planning to begin using it year round going forward as there is an overall benefit to their health as well.I encourage you to give Flea Free a try!",dogs,3
So this crate is much smaller than I anticipated. I have a medium to small dog and he can turn in the crate but there's no standing room.

"I have a (very, very, very) rambunctious Border Collie who just turned 1 in November, and have been through everything with her; Chokers, halters, have tried the dog whisperer crap with having collars high on the neck, NONE of it worked effectively, she still pulled like a bat out of hell.When I got received my package this afternoon, (along with a new Lupine 2ft traffic leash, which I also love!), put this on her, and she changed. Literally, as soon as I snapped this on her, put the loop around her nose, she DID NOT PULL, not even once!Now, taking into consideration the pure wonder that I felt when she actually behaved",dogs,3
"This cat litter box is superior to all others, even the electric kind - which I have tried.Cleaning is just a matter of rolling upside down and then back again and then emptying the cartridge. So simple. The reason why this model is BETTER than my electric models I have owned is that it requires no batteries, my cats aren't afraid of it, it is a private enclosure AND it will NEVER BREAK! my electric one broke after a year and at $100 I feel that the price was just not worth it! This one is a fraction of that price and will never break.The only thing you need to consider is that you will need ample space to ""Roll"" it on it's top and back again. If you buy the large size plan for at least 3 feet.",cats,2
"Great for trips to vet and the removable wire door allows me to keep carrier out for cat to use (and get used to) without worrying he will get locked inside. Easy to assemble and clean. Comes with top ""pocket"" that holds clip-on water/food cup and if using the cup, leash fits nicely into pocket. Has top loop to secure door for airline requirements (you have to provide your own rope or whathaveyou to thread through loop and mesh door).The only drawback is that the opening for the door is narrow--metal door takes up 1.5 inches of 7.25 inch opening and only opens straight out (not flat to side). For a cat who doesn't like carriers, makes it tricky to get him in without hooking a foot or knocking door shut. (I grab carrier between my legs upright and ""drop"" cat in).",cats,2

"I wish I could tell how well these flea preventors really work, but all I can tell by is my dogs itching habbits.

This could also be the downside, though--Our dog doesn't chew them up but our neighbor's dog will, so you might have to keep these frisbees hidden when you're not throwing them around, depending on how your dog treats them. I think the directions say to ""Discourage your dog from using as a chew toy,"" but that may be easier said than done for some dogs. Overall, though, we have no problems and we'll order more in the future.",dogs,3

I love this ball for at night when my pup wants to play but I am busy or tired. This ball is awesome.I think this is a pct ball no problems at all but the price is a little high.

"I bought this pet stroller 7 months ago to transport my large cat with me. I've used it quite a few times now. It makes travel so much easier. I've used it on the train and have been easily able to use this along with my luggage that rolls with no problem. My cat is so much more comfortable and a little less stressed out. I really dislike carrying him in a pet bag, it's too heavy and hurts my shoulder, not mention the stress of trying to get him to go into a pet bag and trying to keep it from bumping into your body as you walk, whereas a pet stroller he goes right into and transport is smooth and easy. The stroller is so cute and when people see it they initially think it's a baby stroller until they hear my cat meow! People who see it ask about it and think it's a great idea.The front wheel swivels and maneuvers in any direction easily. The compartment is large and spacious. My cat is long and weighs 12.5 lbs and has plenty of room and views all around him to see what's going on. The brakes keep it steady on the train when it is stopping and going. It is durable and easily folds down for storage and pops-up to use again. This was a great purchase for me and Chewie :0)",dogs,3

If you don't give her one on demand, she barks and then barks again and then barks again - a single bark each time - as she sits in the kitchen patiently waiting for her dumbbell - and won't accept any other kind of treat. Her mind is fixated on these chicken dumbbells! When you do give it to her, she snatches it in her mouth and runs away like she has the King's ransom!",dogs,3
"Please, please, PLEASE do not ignore these reviews. If you buy this Hartz product, you are playing Russian roulette with your kitten's life. It seems that many kittens cannot digest this crap. My poor baby kitten, which I had been feeding for four days, died because of this stuff. I am almost sure of it. Call it a ""mother's intuition"". When we started feeding her this, she would have the same indications other kittens who died on this stuff had--going into trances, paralyzation, pain, vomiting, greasy poo, bad gas, confusion, lethargy . . . . and she got like this every time we fed her! I was so harried to get nutrition into her that I didn't suspect the food until it was too late. She wasn't able to digest it right, so she wasn't getting the nutrition she needed. She became too weak and was in too much pain. My last memories of her was of her extremely disoriented, trying to go off and hide. She just wandered around aimlessly, very uncomfortable, going into trances and passing out over and over again. I ended up putting her in a box with blankets and she just put her head in the corner while still standing. Then she started intermittently meowing loudly and her tail was twitching oddly. After that, she became unresponsive. She was letting out bad gas (again). I took her to the vet and they put her in an incubator with oxygen (for the second day), and she looked like she wasn't even there anymore. I had been watching her dying all along, and I had to put her to sleep.I am inconsolable about her death, and I don't want any other owner or kitten to go through this again. Look into other alternatives, like PetAg's KMR. There are others as well, but I have read that KMR is the best. I only got this crap because it was the only thing available at Wal-Mart, which was where I happened to be at the time. I wonder how different things would be now if I had gone instead to Petco . . . . She's now buried in my backyard and she will live on in my memories.",cats,2

Whenever I come home from work, one of my cats will carry the cat dancer to me in her mouth, then sit there and meow until I pick it up and play with her. I know, the idea sounds pretty simple - some pieces of cardboard on a piece of wire - but believe me, it is a very effective toy. It's also very easy to use, you basically just have to sit there and wiggle it around a little, and the cats will go nuts.

"This gate was a life saver. It took a good while to find something wide enough for our 47 1/4&#34; opening and this was incredibly reasonably priced, compared to other wide gates. Not only so, it is durable, slides open fairly easily (trick is to push to slide closed from the middle of the gate, not the top), and doesn't pinch my baby's fingers. I hang toys from the gate so he isn't so put out by its presence as a barrier to the kitchen. We don't always have to keep it locked completely, as it stays shut pretty well when opened all the way and somewhat engaged with the closure strip. As my baby gets older, though, and starts shaking it and pulling up on it, we will lock it. It's not too hard to unlock and swing open, fortunately, and can be done with one hand. Also, we attached a magnet to the gate and strip of metal to the side of the cabinet where the retracted gate swings out of the way, to keep it secured and not swinging freely in our way. It works wonderfully. Thanks again!",dogs,3

"I now have purchased two of these pee pad holders. It works very well. We started training our little yorkie to use pee pads only as soon as we got her at 12 weeks of age. (She is now nearly 5 yrs old.) We knew she would not be bigger than 5 pounds and thought this would work well for her and we would not have to take her outside each time she needed to go. One advantage of using this holder over just putting pads on the floor, is the beveled edge all around. If she gets a little too close to the edge, instead of getting our carpet wet, only the edge of the holder gets it. Simple to wipe off. Our original holder is now 5 years old and is like new. It folds up in half so we can easily take it with us when we travel.Suggestion",dogs,3

I purchased this seat cover for a Nissan Rogue and it fits perfectly. It stays on even with a large 110 lb dog sitting on it. Its super easy to install and easy to remove as well. The openings for the seatbelts all line up too except you can't use the middle seat shoulder belt with the seat cover installed. The seat belt openings do allow beach sand to go thru. This means I still have to vacuum the seats after use. But that's so much easier than the husky hair and dirt we would have to clean without the seat cover. I have actually sat in the back seat with the dog and found the cover comfortable to sit on- its not slippery at all. It stays cool even in the sun.,dogs,3

We purchased our Mega Box over 3 years ago for our four cats. The product has worked flawlessly for that entire time, we did not order it direct from the company but purchased it from a large local pet supply retailer. Yes, the cats kick litter all over the place, but that certainly doesn't seem to be caused by the box or it's mechanism. My cats just happen to be enthusiastic excavators. We solved the problem by putting the box in the garage and installing a pet door. It controls odors so well that people don't realize that we have cats until one walks through the room.

"Our pup loves this toy. She loves to swing it around and chew it. It has endured about 5 weeks of enthusiastic puppy chewing. I recently noted that the softer yarn rope was coming apart. I took a heavy scissors and cut it out, then tightened down the other ropes. It now has a smaller center but is otherwise good as new.",dogs,3
"I've used the gentle leader now for a few weeks with my 8 month old dachshund/beagle. He used to run to the door and hit the bells to go outside, now he cringes when I want to take him out and will even hide so I can't take him out. When putting it on him, he will stretch his nose upward extending his neck so I have a difficult time closing it. once it is on he seems fine. He does not try to rub it off and he walks great with it. We have been going on nice long walks and he seems to enjoy them. I have mixed feelings about it though. I love how easy it is to walk with him now, but really wish he didn't hate it so much. I'm almost afraid it will affect his house breaking.",dogs,3
This product at this price is a great deal! It is much nicer than any I've seen in stores and it was $20 cheaper than Doctors Foster and Smith! Lucy (10 mos old) can climb nearly to the top (she could go all the way if she wasn't so fat!) - it is plenty tall - the ad photo does not exaggerate. We are very pleased with the Ultimate Scratch Post.,cats,2
Item arrived quickly and in new condition. Nice selection of colors and the design that I chose have colors that pop. Seems sturdy and it's adjustable. It's my cats first harness and it's been working fine.,cats,2
"Well made, will probably last longer than the cats. Both our cats seem interested in occasionally messing around with the toy box, checking it out to see if anything has changed. Certainly worth the money, just for the entertainment value. Probably better-suited to younger cats (mine are on their last legs.) Here's a warning",cats,2
Good supplement for my dogs. They love the taste and I have definitely seen a change for the better in them! They are healthier!,dogs,3
"Wow, what a great product. We bought it 2 months ago before a Yosemite trip. At first, the noise made them suspicious, now they KNOW what it means. ""time to eat"" You can feed the cats different times up to 8 times a day. We opted for once a day for the trip, and filled it to the brim. Along with 3 kitty litters, and multiple bowls of water, we saved time and money and energy from having a pet sitter (even if it is a friend) ON a daily basis, I set it for 3 times a day, because of their constant ""hounding"" me for food. Has worked perfect so far. Fantastic product.",cats,2
"The gold zinc pen is extremely well made, well constructed and solid. Delivery was prompt. I am very pleased with my purchase.",dogs,3
"You get your money's worth, and if you have a dog that is an aggressive eater this is a must. Stores and extends easily. I highly recommend it.",cats,2
"Love Feliway, it helps with our cat's agressive attitude with his smaller sister, it's just a bit expensive for a Senior or someone on a fixed income...",cats,2
"My 10 month schnoodle (1/2 schnauzer, 1/2 poodle) loves this toy! It's just the right size for her to carry around (she's 17 pounds) and she loves to toss it and retrieve it as well. Sometimes she will go over to her toy basket and just nudge it to hear it talk. Her favorite thing is to smack it with her nose so that it goes careening around the tiled floor, talking to her the whole time, and she merrily chases it. Our cats also are curious about it (in a cautious way) and will stalk it and tentaively bat at it. Or course, once it starts talking, the puppy comes running, and then the cats run for cover! Good times!",dogs,3
"My cat loves to ride in the car and hates being in the carrier. She likes to look around. With this car seat, she can stay in my sight, still be able to look around at all the cars outside, and be close to her Mommy (which is better than her trying to sit on my lap) The only problem is that it fits a little bit weird over racerback seats. Bucket seats would probably be better. Overall, though, I'm glad I bought this product, despite the hilarious comments from my friends.",dogs,3
"Worth every cent. Had a Litter Robot, but sold it because I toilet trained the cat. Then had to go back to litter box because of his injury, so tried Omega Paw (good but smelly and hard to clean the grates) and Pet Safe automatic litter box (hated that one)and now find myself the proud owner of Litter Robot again. It makes your life so much easier. It's quiet, it takes care of itself. It's expensive, but you can get a refurbished one from the website that is just like new at quite a savings. It's big but it is 100% worth it!!",cats,2
"it took a little while for our cat to catch on to the alpine scratcher. he still seems to prefer the cabinet and desk but is using his new scratching ""post"" more frequently.",cats,2

"I purchased this product almost six months ago and have given it time to write this review. As pet owners, we are always looking for a product that entertains and keeps our four-legged friends busy. Especially after a long days work, etc. I have a 38lb. black Spanador (Cocker Spaniel and Lab mix). This breed is high energy and needs to be active much of the time. She is also a CHEWER! I do not recommend this ball for really any dog. No matter if the dog is high or low energy or chews/not chews. In my experience the ball made her more 'spastic' and crazy. I believe it was overstimulating her in a negative way. Also, the ball started to break apart in little pieces after only a few hours. I do not recommend this product. Maybe if the manufacture rubberized it in the tough material that Kongs and other durable products are made out of. I found that walks and fetch still prove to be her favorite past times. They just want to be with us.",dogs,3
"I bought this supplement for 2 of my dogs. The dog that needs it the most, can't stand the smell or taste. The other dog does not mind it at all. I agree the liver smell is quite strong and not very pleasing but the ingredients are good. I wish both dogs would eat it.",dogs,3
my 4 dogs all had allergies and are just fine now that i switched to Wellness.. The fush one smell abit but .. they still love it ..Either the dried orthe canned r terrific flavors..WITH NOOO GRANI!,dogs,3
"Arrived pretty quickly.Almost perfect, would have liked it to be a little wider, my dog has a longer type hair and the collar gets a little lost, being wider would help it stand out and show off the jewels!But very happy with this purchase.Would recommend this to a friend.",dogs,3
"Great product! My dog is a very strong, powerful, athletic girl. (I am not.) She swims, does jump training, plays frisbee and goes on a 1-2 mile walk twice daily. The collar takes some getting used to (for human and canine) but the pleasure of a positive interaction is worth the effort.For 1st time buyers, please purchase a collar that includes the instructional DVD. The information and helpful tips were invaluable.A side note",dogs,3
"I thought the dog would love this (It's the 70s style water bed, but for the pup (just wait a couple of years and dogs be saying their back hurts)), but the dog does't like the fact that it's swishes around (moves) when she steps on it! Won't go on it at all, and it's too little for me :(PROS",dogs,3
"We have 3 cats. Our newest, Buddy, is 2. He sits on top..teetering on the edge, and poops into the hole. Then, he turns around and reaches in with his front paws and covers it. My other cat, Stan, gets in and does his business. Our cat Stella couldn't get out so we had to take the top off. She is really fat. It is hilarious to watch Bud go poo. He does get in to urinate.We love it just for the entertainment value.",cats,2
"Title pretty much says it all. This flake food doesn't make your tank cloudy, It's highly nutritious, and has color enhancing (which DOES work very well-you can tell the difference). Simply the best flake food on the market.",fish aquatic pets,4
My 3 Siberian Huskies love this ball! I purchased the 8'' size. My smallest Husky weighs 45 lbs & my largest Husky weighs 68 lbs. It is the perfect size for ALL 3 of them. Out of all their many toys along with several other balls... this one is their favorite! I am coming back to purchase another one. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE.,dogs,3
"With two Alaskan Malamutes, there is no way I could properly exercise them each day without this product. At a slow pace they can practice proper gait for the show ring and at a faster pace they can burn up some of that extra energy. If you have dogs that love (and were bred) to pull like I do, they can pull to their hearts content. Initially I ran them separately but since the springer allows for switching the unit from one side to the other, I bought a second and now run them together. They enjoy being out together and it saves time.Although some pictures show using the unit without a leash, I would advise against that. If you have a big dog you need to be able to control it if a rabbit or other critter runs out of the brush. I use a short leash about 3 foot long on each dog.Also I was not happy with the method of hooking the dogs up. Instead each dog wears a Distance Harness from Howling Dog Mushing Supplies[...]I use a brass double ended bolt snap to hook from the harnesses to the springer.",dogs,3
"I bought this cat tree for my mother- in-law. After carefully reading all of the reviews that where posted we decided to purchase this one, even though same assembly was required. At first glance the instruction where confusing, but after some though it become clear that the instructions make you assemble the tree from the wrong end. If you are able to read you should be able to assemble this tree it&#8217;s not rocker science. It took us about 20 minutes not an hour like some reviews claimed. If you get pass the assembly the tree itself is nicely maid, the material is very soft and the triangles on top are a perfect resting spot for curious kittens and cats. The tree arrived by UPS with no problems. I would highly recommend this to every cat.",cats,2
"I've wondered why people always give negative reviews for pin brushes that have round pin heads on it insead of straight pins. I can understand for show dogs or if you definitely don't want to cause any hair loss from brushing, then you need a straight pin brush such as a Chris Christensen. I have a CC brush, and oh man it really runs smoothly. But I haven't used it for a long time. Because for me, I DO want to lift and brush out as much as loose hair as I can.If you use any undercoat rakes, Furminator, universal slicker brush, Mars Coat King or alike, chances are you want to get rid of those loose undercoat hair that can get tangled up or spread around your place. If that's the case, you would want to use a brush with rounded pin heads like this one. It'd lift and catch more loose hair than a straight pin brush but cause less skin irritation because of the rounded pin heads. By the way, trust me that you don't want to use those undercoat rakes, Furminator, slicker brush or Mars coat king. They will either hurt your dog or pull/cut some top coat definitely more than a pin brush. You just need to simply brush out all the loose hair before they get tangled up.I found this Millers Forge Pin Brush meets my purpose as stated above. My dog has white undercoat and black top coat. Everytime after I brush I can see white hair on the brush but no black hair, so I know I am brushing out those loose undercoat hair. I only hope the pin area can be a bit bigger for large dogs. It is light and comfortable to hold though. I don't have the brush in front of me now, but I'd say the pin is about 3/4inch long. Many pin brushes I used before the pins will start to sack into the rubber base after about a year of use. I don't know how long this one will last.",dogs,3
I love this puppy play pen. I take my puppies to my office and this contains them well. It folds up easily and is made of quality materials. I also put EZ whelp pad under it so my office floor stays clean and dry. This has worked perfectly!,dogs,3
"This was a great size for my love birds. They did not tear this one apart, the actually used it.",birds,0
"great for slowing down some fast eaters and keeping food time interesting. although one cat definitely has dominance over the toy, my cats will bat and follow this food/treat distributing device around until it's empty. definitely has helped with fewer regurgitations from over-gorging with my cats.",cats,2
"I had to try these treats and are rather impressed with them. I have larger dogs (bullmastiff etc) but they work well for him too. They are square, solid and obviously pretty tasty as all three of my dogs love them. There is a lot in the box and I think for the price, well worth it, being made with good stuff. I recommend to anyone who is the ""treat"" man or lady.",dogs,3
"If you have two cats, this is NOT the right product. I have to change the litter tray once a week instead of once a month, as the ad indicates. The urine soaks through the paper trays and smells. The crystal litter doesn't get the opportunity to help extract the liquid (and thus the smell) from the feces as it is scooped under a paper hood where it is out of sight, but not out of mind (or smell). The trays are incredibly expensive compared to bag litter, even Fresh Step's crystal litter bags. The rake needs to be realigned on a regular basis. It is expensive, annoying and not worth its price.",cats,2
This has lots of room to store your pets stuff when travelling with him and it keeps him safe during the car ride. The fact that the car seat becomes a bed too is extremely convenient when going for a night or more away from home. Also it's easy to put into the car.,dogs,3
We never go without this great product..... Never get ticks or fleas around our house. Our fur babies are so happy.Thank You!,dogs,3
"If you have a dog and you walk her/him, you need this product! These bags are great, so much more useful and convenient to use than regular plastic bags. You can use them to give water to your pooch as well which is great when it's hot or on a long hike. I love this product!",dogs,3
"I feed my cats Weruva cat food -- which they LOVE. When I first started using this gel product, I tried to get my cats to lick it up like they do when I give them petromalt for hair balls. They wouldn't have anything to do with it. Then I mixed it into their wet food, and although they sniffed it suspiciously, they finally ate it. It can be messy to use -- it is easy to squeeze out too much, so you have to waste some of the product wiping the excess off the cap. I just started using it, so I can't yet comment on its effectiveness. If it turns out to be effective, when I run out I think I'll spend a little more and buy the paste formula. You can get it in a pump that dispenses a measured dose which will hopefully eliminate the use of a measuring spoon and over dispensing of product.",cats,2
"This ball is made of soft material. From the picture, it looks like a harder, more durable material. My dog had chewed this to bits in no time.",dogs,3
The Petsafe collar does not work. It keeps shutting off when you most need it. I have tried new batteries. This product does not deliver as promised. I am returning it after 60 days.,dogs,3
"Our Amazon absolutely loves nutriberries, he is not happy in the morning until he gets his nutriberri breakfast, so a couple of months ago, when I saw that this seller was offering them at a great price, (since then they have raised their prices), I ordered several bags of them. I just now opened the first one and realized I was sent Nutriberries for MACAWS AND COCKATOOS, instead of PARROT nutriberries as stated in their product description. These berries are definitely alot larger than the parrot sized berries and my Amazon is having trouble holding onto them. It is too late to return them. I am really disappointed as these berries are pricy!!!! If the seller offers different sizes that should be mentioned in their product description, it was not.",birds,0
The cats and I really like this item. It keeps the bed warm all night. It's hard so we don't like to lie on top of it unless it has a blanket over top. We like it a lot and I've never tried to chew on it even though it looks a little like a frisbee.,cats,2
The order came in fast - however when i opened package i noticed that i did not receive the hanger attachment to go along with bowl.,dogs,3
"After struggling with other clippers, I was so pleased to find a clipper that actually shaves through the many layers of hair my yellow lab has. Shaving time was drastically reduced which was great for myself, but more importantly, my restless dog. I am so happy to finally have found clippers that work... you can't go wrong with these! Warning though, these do cut right down to the skin, so I'd recommend ordering the attachments for a longer cut.",dogs,3
"We have 4 cats so we are constantly scooping poop. I've tried other versions of sifters but they all worked horribly. When I got this it took us 2 weeks to find the correct cat litter that worked without it getting stuck. But, now it is amazing. Make sure you have all of the hinges attached or cat litter will go everywhere. I would rather have some spill out than hand scoop everyday. I would recommend this product to everyone and it's so easy to use!",cats,2
"I can't believe it took me so long to find this. The gate works great to keep our dog out of the basement while allowing the cats to pass through. Construction is solid/sturdy. Installation is easy and instructions are clear. Additional rail (2 sizes)included to work with various opening sizes. The gate has a clean look and is easy to operate. I would definintely recommend this and would purchase another, if needed.",dogs,3
"This is by far the *best* clumping cat litter on the market today. After using big names like Tidy Cat and Fresh Step, I realized (as well as my cats) those brands can't hold a candle to Premium Choice. Superior yet affordable! Amazon packaging could be improved -- had some spills when ordering larger bags in the past -- but if you have more than 1 or 2 cats, Premium Choice is definitely worth every penny.",cats,2
"This spray works! You will have to use it twice,though. Use once as directed, then wait two weeks and do it again. It will eliminate the problem.",dogs,3
I bought this toy for my dog who loves to run and play catch. She loves it so much. It takes a few tries to get used to but once you're comfortable you can throw the ball extremely far.,dogs,3
"I purchased this with alot of apprehension after reading all the negative reviews, but I just couldn't help myself. I really hate cleaning the litter box THAT much. I followed the instructions carefully, using only a little bit of litter, which is where I assume most of the bad reviewers went wrong. I have two very large cats, that really...take care of business in the litter box, so my Littermaid has really been put thru the ultimate test over the last few months of having it. Occasionally, if one of the cats goes directly on the rake, it clumps onto it, but it comes with a tool that easily dislodges it. I empty the recepticle about once a week, reusing the same tray a few times to save money on refills. So all-in-all this was a great purchase, I dont mind occasionally tending to the litterbox when there are clogs, its well worth the exchange of not having to scoop litter every day. Also the ionic filter works wonders, there is almost zero odor!I dont know what the other reviewers were doing wrong or perhaps they just has insanely high expectations..come on people, this is a litterbox.",cats,2
This product was recommended by my vet for her urinary track problems. It is working wonderfully. I sprinkle half a capsule on her food morning and night. Buying it from Amazon is much more economical than from my vet.,cats,2
"Our dog loves her Bad CUZ, but this toy she loves more than any other. She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage. One thing - protect your toes with this toy - it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit. I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick-knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it. Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't broken yet.As far as treats to go into it - remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty...",dogs,3
"As advertised, So simple, definately a design from the KISS method of engineering. I would recommend this to everyone. I hope this helps.",cats,2
"I made sure to do my research first when I bought this item so I didnt end up like those upset and frustrated people who left the one and two star responses. Making sure that this was the proper product for the proper animal (ASH Cat with a really thick undercoat..)I introduced the FURminator to my shedding fuzzball feline... and it was a hit! Lots of purrs and she even tries to nuzzle and rub against it, she loves it so much! The FURminator works much, much better than the last few brushes and grooming tools I bought to help control the fur shedding *everywhere*.This is one of those things that you really need to research and check into to see if your pet would benefit from this. Not all dogs and cats have the kind of fur that would make this tool appropriate, but for the ones who do, this is a magnificent and very useful invention!",cats,2
"Ok..we bought a ""Panic Mouse"" for our cats/kittens. While the older cats walked by it with expressions of indifference. The kittens have a blast with it!It moves and turns randomly so they never know which way it will go..ok..I admit..once in awhile one gets knocked in the head by it...but it's still funny! You can adjust the speed so it goes slower, which we did until they got the hang of it then it was FULL power. It even keeps the kids entertained! Just remember to shut if off or you will be buying batteries left and right.If you buy one buy the extra wand and 3 mice, as the strings are pretty flimsy and break easy. Or go buy some string and a few pom poms and make them yourself.",cats,2
"Yes, this is a bad product. I used new batteries, charged it well and it worked for about 2 minutes and then it stopped working. After recharging it there was no improvement. Waste of $12. Great idea, poor execution!",cats,2
My cat loves playing with this toy. And I think it is so cute that it says green fish.,cats,2

"We HAD to do something about our pets on the furniture before we bought a new couch, and we REALLY needed a new couch, so I did a lot of research and ended up buying these. They are PERFECT. We tested them out on ourselves first and anyone worried about harming their animals is worried for nothing. I even talked about it with my vet as we have two special kitties who sometimes have seizures and both, we think, have cerebellar hypoplasia. But both the kitties did fine when we tested them on it on the floor, and my vet was not concerned. They and our non-special (but still special! hahaha) kitty and the dog learned immediately, took no time at all. I actually over-bought so now I have extra for when we move and buy another chair. Before, the animals were always all over the couch, and the cats would sometimes pee on the couch, which is unfathomably frustrating, especially when it happens over and over. A couch is one of the most annoying things to clean EVER. But this saved us. It worked so well that we could actually buy a leather couch and not have to worry about them clawing it, peeing on it or anything. And we taught them that it's safe when the pads are not on, so they can still snuggle with us when we want them to. The materials are great and do not retain shape-memory, so they unfold flat no matter how long it's been since you used them last. We just roll them up and stick them on our coffee table shelf, they look totally normal there and are easy to whip out in a second. We've had them months and the batteries are still good. We could not be more pleased. WAY easier and simple and cheaper than buying a couch cover, and it's so effortless, it makes all other tactics, like piling things on your couch, or blockading a room with other heavy or bulky things, seem ridiculous. I would recommend that everyone at least try this product, and if you don't like it you can always return it.",dogs,3
MY CHICO LOVES THIS TOY AND HE PLAYS WITH IT EVERYDAY.IT THE FIRST TOY HE ALWAYS PICKS OUT OF HIS TOY BOX. CHICO LOVES RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE WITH THIS TOY!,dogs,3
"I purchased one of these a few years ago, after looking at several options. At that time, the steps were Made in the USA (I assume they still are). The steps are one piece, vacuum-formed (so the shape you see outside is the same shape, but hollow, from the bottom). Due to the one-piece construction, they will hold a LOT of weight. So, these will work for the smallest, or the largest of dogs. The carpet pads are securely attached, and a quick vacuum will clean them. The plastic is easy to clean with a damp towel or sponge. The height of the stairs is perfect for a bed, but might be a little tall for a low-sitting couch. One concern some pet owners may have is the interface with the floor. The plastic ""walls"" touch the floor on the front, and the back corners only. There are no rubber or carpet pads to keep the stairs from skidding around on a hard surface floor. If it's on a carpeted surface, there shouldn't be a problem. In my case, I have a concrete floor, and a beagle. When I first got the stairs, my hyperactive puppy would race into my room and hit the steps full speed, trying to get onto my bed. This would cause the stairs to move around. I finally solved this by shoving a heavy box in the hollow underside, pinning the stairs to the side of the bed. Overall, I love these steps, and my beagle constantly uses them to race on and off the bed.",cats,2
"We've got a few of these. You can put the entire thing in the washer and dryer. So, they can stay clean and smell free. We've got them in the bedroom and the living room so our dogs can be comfortable, and our couch doesn't get covered in hair. They are not very cushy in the middle, but we have them on the carpet, and they dogs seem to like them.",dogs,3

"I have been using Prozyme for over twenty years. I have Great Danes, and they can bloat easily. Prozyme prevents them from farting, which means to me they are producing a lot less gas, so less likely to bloat. Also it is a lot nicer to have them around. It's great to have it available on Amazon. I look for the cheapest way to get it. I use 1/4 teaspoon in each dog's food each meal, that seems to be enough. For a dog under fifty pounds I would use less.",dogs,3
"Good price dog loves not having to scratch himself allday. Fleas were gone soon after aplying, Dogs happy so am I..",dogs,3
I tried everything except surgery which might not work too. The vet said he would need to unclog his tear ducts. I tried everything on the internet that was cheaper than angel eyes and NOTHING worked. Finally I tried Angel Eyes. It was more costly so I saved it for last. It worked!! It took a long time though. Almost a month. I mix it with a little food because he eats dry food and live with another dog. He loves the taste so no problem there. No negative symptoms either. I give it to him now every 3 days and it saves me money and keeps his eyes clean. He was always so sickly looking with long dark drainage from his eyes. Now he looks much happier.,dogs,3

"I was doubtful that this would work as it said it did - but I have been searching for years (yes, years)to find a solution for the excess cat litter that gets all over the house.... I have tried the square ones that all the pet stores sell. But this is just awesome! Most of the litter is caught on the steps - and I have 2 cats - and they took to it without even having to do the ""here it is "" routine. AND I no longer have to vacuum and sweep every day. Not that there are not drawbacks - getting the litter off the steps is a bit of challenge - I am considering a hand held ""whisk"" broom and I had to take the round top off out of the top - so it is open on the top as I have one cat that freaks out in closed spaces. The upside of removing the round top in the top is that you do not have to invest in the filters - as it is open to the air.I can not say enough about it - and have recommended to it several folks already!",cats,2

"This product was recommended when I adopted my dog. I had been buying it at a local pet-supply shop that had only one size package.

The product works well for us and paying less is always popular.",dogs,3
"I have had the Litter Robot a few weeks now and very pleased with it's performance. I did not realize that cats needed to be five lbs. in order to activate the cycle. We have a four month old kitten, so we are using it manually until she matures. She adapted to it within two days. I used the suggestions enclosed---leaving her litter box next to the Litter Robot and not cleaning it, also adding a little of her litter from her box to the Litter Robot. She went in to investigate, but didn't use the Robot until I removed her old litter box and then she took to it immediately! It is wonderful to let the Robot sift and dump----I hated that smelly job! I have added a stick-on deoderizer to the disposal box and empty once a day to keep clean. Expect that a few days to a week would be OK if I were away. Anxious to use the fully automated mode but enjoying the kitten stage. What a wonderful invention!",cats,2

"I have 3 dogs and a huge amount of dirt and mud in my back yard, so I purchased these collars for them hoping they would clean up nicer than traditional collars. I have tried leather, nylon, metal... the list is endless, and all of them end up stained. These collars clean up very well! The only minor drawback I found was the little name plate. It sort of just pops in the window, and one of my dogs promptly popped it right back out and lost it in the yard somewhere on day 2. Not a big deal since the purpose was not really for their ID (we use different collars when we go out and about).

"I love this toy and am looking forward to trying out one of the other animals. My aussie/border collie mix puppy loves his platypus. I put treats in it when i have to go to work, so he doesnt notice me leaving. I dont use the eggs too much. Sometimes i stick one in to block the whole, but all 3 was too much for my little pup. He has had his toy for a couple of months now and he has ripped the egg hole in the belly a bit bigger, but ever with that the toy is still great. The eggs are fun and we use them to play with seperate fromt he platypus as well. They are good squeaker toys. The set come swith extras, which i havent even had to open because they hold up so well. The toy does well in the waser and dryer too. Overall this a graet toy, one of my pups favorites. Great price for such a good toy!",dogs,3

"I got this collar because we had a reflective braided leash (that we got from Walmart) that was the best leash we've ever tried and I thought this reflective braided collar would be great too (even though it wasn't from the same company). However, this collar also has an unbraided portion, which is the weakest link in this case. The braided part is strong enough (although not as strong as the Walmart leash we had) but beyond that, the unbraided portion was flimsy. Not only would the end of the collar beyond the buckle keep slipping out, but the rings on the unbraided portion would break off and that portion would start to fray, so we had to replace it because the collar was slipping off every time our dog pulled hard on it when leashed.I could see this collar lasting longer for a small dog, but we have a strong 60-lb dog that will pull against the leash sometimes and this collar just couldn't withstand that.",dogs,3

Their little lives are too short to not get food that they truly love and my cats ALL love Fancy Feast dry and wet. Indulge your babies in a little junk food on occasion, it won't hurt anything. I have a little junk food myself sometimes cause it makes me happy, too. :)",cats,2
"I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is a chew-maniac. I bought this bear hoping it would last a bit longer than most, based on good things I have heard about the Kong brand. It's been about a month and a half now, and he has ripped out the pouch for the replaceable squeaker (the squeaker itself was the 1st thing to go- in the first week), but the squeaker in the bear's head is still there. Aside from that, the rest of the bear is fully intact. My pup treats it with care, not biting as hard as usual when playing tug of war. He also plays fetch with it, but surprisingly does not chew it. I have seen him licking it and carrying it around though. When I get home from work, he often greets me at the door with a toy already in his mouth, and this bear is definitely one of his favorites.",dogs,3

"I have a ten month old 40 lbs Boarder Collie / Jack Russell mix (yea I know how did that happen). He is a very smart dog and needs work to keep busy. If he does not have work he'll find his own, which is really, REALLY not a good thing. He is quite rough on toys. Any thing soft stuffed only lasts hours before it's shredded. He can empty a Kong in a few minutes. I bought him the large version of this ball at my trainers recommendation and he LOVES it. I load it with about a cup of kibble and that keeps him busy for about an hour. I often give it to him before leaving the home which eliminates separation anxiety barking. I also have the similar Twist and Treat cone which he likes, but he seems to prefer this toy more. The Twist and Treat can be adjusted to make it tough or easy to get the kibble out, but it does not hold as much food. They are both good. The Twist and Treat however stays in place more where he is all over the house with this ball. These two toys and the Kong are the only things he has not destroyed in an afternoon. For smart dogs food puzzle are simple the best toys EVER and this is a very good one.",dogs,3
"Based on customers reviews and recommendations, i did purchase this product. However, i did not find advantage as effective as most others have. In fact, I did not find this product effective AT ALL. I wouldn't waste my money purchasing advantage. I treated three dogs (all under 10lbs like recommended)and also treated my entire house with carpet flea killer (just to make sure). The fleas did die within the first 12 hours, which gave me hope for my pour dogs, then two days later, the fleas are back! This treatment did NOT keep the fleas OFF. It only killed what was already on them. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This was a waste of $32!",dogs,3
"I bought one of these for my dog (now 11 year old Shih-Tzu who is about 12lbs) after she was put on some medication that drastically increased her hunger and thirst. I bought this in the hopes that it would provide some metal and physical stimulation, as well as slowing down her meal time. The first time I gave it to her I had to show her how it worked (she was always given food in her bowl and had never seen a treat dispenser in her life), but she quickly picked up the game of rolling the ball to get kibble. At first it took her almost 30 minutes to empty the ball of 1/4 cup of kibble. She's gotten used to having to work for her food, and now it only takes her 5-10 minutes to empty the ball. Sometimes she'll roll it with her nose, but most of the time she rolls it with one of her paws; either way, she loves the food reward. Overall, I am impressed with the product. My dog is not a chewer at all, so I cannot comment on the durability of the product in the respect, however, the ball did exactly what I was hoping it would do. As a beginner toy, this ball was great. I love the inner lip to keep the kibble from simply falling out immediately, and the ball holds exactly one meal for my dog. After using the ball for over a year, my dog still enjoys it, but I want to challenge her with more difficult toys. I think this is a great option if you have a smaller dog who does not chew everything and who is food driven and you want to stimulate your dog physically and mentally. I recommend this type of treat dispenser to all my friends who have small dogs who eat too quickly. The only reason I give it 4/5 and not 5/5 is because after a year it has become too easy and there is no way to adjust the difficulty for my dog.",dogs,3
"There's a 3 year old tabby that's been staying with me for about two weeks now. She was abandoned when my downstairs neighbor moved out. Her name is Charlie but I call her Galavanting Cat because that's what she is. When you let her out to potty, she stays out for hours, sometimes days. She is fun to have around, though, when she is around. Having her around has obviously caught me off guard so now I'm almost like a pet owner, and with it, new responsibilities. I bought a bag of Friskies Seafood Sensations this afternoon and, when I got back, gave her a handful. I wasn't sure if she'd eat it because her diet up till now has been wet can food and whatever meat I cooked (beef, chicken, etc). She took to the dry stuff right away, crunching to her heart's delight like a diner in a Zagat restaurant. I'm glad she liked it because I know how finicky cats can be. Galavanting Cat loves it, though. It'll be sad losing her when her owner comes back so I'd better not get too close.",cats,2

"I bought two of these balls---one for the 11 month old Rottweiler pup and one for the 12 year old Border Collie. The puppy immediately got the hang of it and spent the next hour chasing it around the house. Unfortunately, the BC is not too keen on it as it represents too much activity, more than her arthritic spine can handle. (She prefers the type of treat dispensing toys that work by simply rolling them around between her paws--no running involved.) I have been using Cheerios, the breakfast cereal, as a low calorie treat and the dogs love them. I have also put part of their kibble ration inside and that works well, too.When you first get the ball, put LOTS of treats inside. That will ensure that the ball dispenses them frequently and your dog will get the hang of it fast. If not enough treats come out in the intial trial, your dog will likely get bored and stop playing or else start to use the ball as a chew toy. All in all, I consider this toy to be a great success and it looks sturdy enough to hold up for a long time. I do, however, remove it between sessions thus assuring that when I do bring it out, it is a special reward.",dogs,3

"I have a friend who has a Littermaid, and has had no problems with it, but mine broke within a couple days. However, I did buy mine used from a yard sale, so that could be part of it. It worked fine at first. One of my cats likes to use the litter box right on the edge of the box, and the Littermaid doesn't clean that area very well. My other cat digs A LOT in the litterbox. Whenever he went, he would pile up all the litter in one big pile. I think that's what killed the motor. He also was used to more litter than what you're required to use for the Littermaid. He likes to dig deep. I have a CatGenie now, and I absolutely LOVE it. I know it's much more expensive than the Littermaid, but it's worth it for me.

The one design issue problem is putting the filter down in the bottle, if you are not careful, the top of the filter will hang up on the top of the bottle lip when you screw the lid on, this will give you a vacuum gap and the system will not work.

She's completely stopped harassing us for food, and now sits and quietly watches the feeder when it's feeding time. She's figured out that the timer has something to do with getting her food, and as it gets closer to feeding time she'll actually sit and stare at the timer!

"I have two large, middle aged male tabbies, and would be soon acquiring a third large, middle aged male tabby. I needed a second, or much larger, litter box, but didn't really have the space for two and didn't want to have to scoop large amounts of poop and pee clumps every single day or sweep up the mess they will inevitably make with the litter. After extensive hemming and hawing about purchasing an automatic litter box, and reading mixed reviews about every single one except for the most expensive one, of course, I came across this gem. I read a large chunk of the reviews on here and other sites and decided it looked like a sound purchase, considering the small price tag. I ordered the large on a Thursday afternoon, and it showed up on my doorstep Saturday morning. I was already quite impressed. I waited until I got my third kitty love and eagerly set it up after he was comfortable with the apartment. It was super easy to assembly and quite large. Even though some of the space inside is occupied by the sifting compartment and waste tray, there was still PLENTY of room inside, more than enough for my 20 pound bear cat. I put about 3 inches of clumping litter inside, placed it in the space where the old box used to be, keeping the old box nearby. After using this thing for a full week, I can safely say I've never taken so much pleasure out of cleaning the cat box, which I have been doing since I was old enough to hold a scooper. I have experienced absolutely NO litter spillage during the flipping of the box, the waste is not sticking to the bottom (just give the bottom a few solid smacks, and everything comes loose), and there is NO SMELL. 100% no cat pee or poop smell, which blew me away. I flip the box once a day and have enough room on the floor of my tiny bathroom to roll it back and forth, so it never has to touch the carpet or leave the bathroom, period. I threw away the old box today, since all three cats have taken to it quite well. Watch the demo video!! I was totally perplexed as to how this thing worked at first until I watched the video. Truly, a genius invention. I told my best friend about it, and she will be purchasing soon for her two cats (and her dog, who loves his ""kitty cookies"" a little too much).",cats,2

She is the first cat I've owned who absolutely does not shed. My vet remarks on how well she's doing and how far she's come, and I attribute it to the love and care...and all the good food. My vet also has told me how important a good diet is for proper brain development and although I cannot claim that Fromm's food made my cat any smarter, it's reasonable to think she has benefited in lots of essential ways. I highly recommend it, and although it is admittedly pricey, it's well worth it. It's much better than anything else I've tried. She ate some of the most expensive supermarket brand for approximately 30 days once, and I could see the difference in the quality of her coat right away. She started shedding, for one thing, something I've never had with Fromm's. I like that it's manufactured by a company who is dedicated to producing a high-quality nutritionally superior pet food. Love your cat? Want a healthy cat? Feed it this food. End of story.",cats,2
Our cats love these toys. We have wood floors so they really get to chase them around the room. The only thing to watch for is if you have a chewing dog. We have one dog who likes to chew these toys so we have to be careful that she doesn't get one.,cats,2
"This costume is cheaply made, but that is not the worst of it. It is definitely not true to size. I bought a size small for my 12-pound dachshund. He fits the measurements for that size according to the official sizing information. This costume is SO BIG that I triple-checked all the tags and packaging, which all say size small! I tried this on my 25-pound Beagle, and it doesn't even fit her! She fell out of it right away as it dragged along the floor. The velcro pieces don't match up either. There is a long strip of velcro on the back that they expect you to attach to a tiny half inch circle of it on the other side.Not worth it unless you plan to do a complete re-fitting and alteration.",dogs,3
"Two Siberian huskies here, and we've tried a number of things--ZoomGrooms, combs, brushes, undercoat rakes, those groovy serrated flexible metal things... none worked particularly well, and the dogs lost interest and patience very quickly. Then our vet-tech recommended the furminator. I was EXTREMELY resistant, not necessarily for the price but just because I couldn't believe it was that much different.I wish I could explain it, but the darn thing works like a champ. Not only did it remove PILES of undercoat without much effort (and even teased out slightly matted hair with a bit of work) but both dogs put up with it MUCH better than with any other method so far; one of them even went so far as to lie down to be groomed, which he NEVER does. In over ten years of owning these guys, they've never looked better with less effort.In short",cats,2
"These puppy snacks are healthy and could be easily broken up so that I could make them last longer, while keeping my puppy interested in obeying my commands for the treat. Stuffing an entire treat into the Small Puppy Kong didn't work out very well though...she could never get it out! I just broke up the treat and put it in there and when she played with it, the treats would easily fall out and she had quite the enjoyable snack!",dogs,3
"Our cats still have the red pom pom and one of our cats will not let it go. These are super fun. If stepped on, they hold up very nicely. Besides, our cats sit on these things and play like crazy.We are very excited to be able to purchase another pack for our indoor cats.",cats,2
"I was able to cut the liner in this cat flap and used it in the aluminum kick plate on my screen door. It installed fine and worked okay at first. Two problems with the unit though. First, the locks are easy to bump with your foot or for your cat to bump going through the door, resulting in a locked door that you don't know about... My poor cat was stuck inside for a day before I figured it out! The second problem is that the magnet in the door came loose and fell out after about 6 months. The door still works but it doesn't shut properly.Okay piece, but for the price I expected higher quality. Not impressed.",cats,2

"This stuff is awesome!!! I put a teaspoon of these cat liter sized granuals into our large cat liter box, and the bad smells were instantly gone, and replaced by a fresh smell... we no longer even know there's a liter box. It lasted all the way up until I did a total cleaning of the liter box.I also sprinkled a very small amount (that's all it takes) in the bottom of my outside garbage cans & a few granuals for the inside garbage cans.I WILL definitely be buying this product forever as a staple for my home, as it works better than baking soda or anything else on the market.This would work wonderful in diaper pails, under your seat in the car.. anyplace!! I love this stuff!!!",cats,2

"I've got a geriatric cat with litter box issues and so far this has been the best box I've used with him. Here's what I like about it:- Low profile entry way with rampMy cat Steve's back legs and hips have been getting progressively weaker (he's over 18) which makes it difficult for him to get up and over the lip of traditional litter boxes. The low entry way and ramp on the Booda are great for him to get in and out of the box easily.- Big deep litter areaSteve also has kidney problems which necessitates subcutaneous fluid treatments to help flush his kidneys. This means he urinates frequently so the litter box fills up quickly. The Booda's litter pan is big and deep so it can handle all the little stops he makes without getting too dirty.- Hooded for cleanlinessWe always kept our litter boxes in the basement, but once Steve was no longer able to navigate stairs easily he started to have accidents on the 1st & 2nd floors of our house. We decided to put a litter box in the dining room but it was always a big ugly mess. Litter would get everywhere and he would sometimes pee just outside the box even tho' he was standing right in it (lots of fun). The Booda solves all this with its hooded design. Steve is fully ""contained"" in there and the dining room smells way, way better.Still, there was one modification I needed to make:- The ramp has undulating ridges with little plastic nodules on it to (theoretically) de-litter-ify cat feet. In practice however, Steve runs down the ramp as fast as possible (uncomfortable on his pads I imagine) and usually ends up slipping a bit. To fix this, I cut out a section of an old bath mat and covered the ramp with it. This gives him soft traction and also rubs the excess litter from his feet. Bath mats are perfect since they have rubber backing on them that grips the ramp and doesn't slip down the incline. Also, when the mat gets dirty I can just throw it in the washer.Altogether the Booda Dome has been a great find for Steve and I. He hasn't thanked me outright, but I can sense he's happier...",cats,2
"I got this automatic water bowl for my 20 pound dachshund, Pickles, because I liked the fact that it said it would circulate the water. It, however, would barely move the water with its weak and basically useless pump.The pump never had the power to produce much of a stream of water and it would randomly make a ton of loud noises.It was a pain to clean and basically needed to be disassembed and reassembled each time to clean it properly.The pump totally stopped working after a little more than 2 months. It would be nice to sell something that does what it says and to a normal standard.My husband always hated it for some reason and said it was 'evil' and 'going to burn down our house one day' I thought that was a little dramatic but it never impressed him.I felt it is a good idea cause I hate to see stagnant water in Pickles' water bowl but they need to redesign the pump with one that actually works since most people are probably buying it for the pump.Be wary and be forewarned!",cats,2
"My Yorkie is neurotic and gets diarrhea when she gets upset or nervous (storms, beeping noises, visitors). She will eat this off my finger or her plate, rather than me having to hold her down and squeeze it down her throat with a syringe like the Diarsanyl the vet gave us (though that also stops the diarrhea). The only thing I don't like is the cost for shipping it (about $8 shipping for a $13 tube); since it must be kept refrigerated it comes packed with ice so I understand the company's cost to ship is more. I can't buy in bulk since I only use about 1 tube every 6 months and I don't want to wind up with expired product I didn't use. But it works and I don't feel bad giving it to my dog so I pay it. My breeder, known for her show dogs, recommended this to me.",dogs,3

"This is the second replacement we've gotten and it seems all of them just go off randomly. Not good when you are trying to train the dogs, but at least it only seems to happen when we're inside. So just make sure that you remove the collars when you let the dogs into the house because they will get zapped for no reason.",dogs,3
We have a GSD and he is a total beast...he can chew through anything! We bought this ball when he was about 6 months old and my husband got the idea to hang it by a longer rope and attach it to our children's swing set. So it hangs down about 3/4 feet from the ground like a tether ball. It's hands down the best form of entertainment for Max. He will jump and clamp down on that ball at just hang from it by his teeth. It's remarkable! The velocity that he hits the ball is a sight to see. He loves it because it satisfies his urge to chew and it has made his hindquarter muscles and shoulder muscles so strong and defined. We get him a new ball about every three months. He looks amazing. This ball is TUFF!,dogs,3
This is by far the best turf saver treat on the market (or was on the market). The last place we were able to purchase this was in Canada. They must have discontinued which is too bad. Every grass saver we have tried does not work. I too would beg Harpers to put this back on the market.,dogs,3
"I got mine here at Amazon and it didn't even come in the hard plastic packaging, just a plastic bag... I think it's a fake, it certainly doesn't work like the company advertised. My dog hates it, and he's normally fine around grooming tools. This is the worst grooming tool ever invented.",cats,2

Our cats weren't sure about this fountain at first but after a few days they seem to really like it. They were used to drinking from the faucet and still need to be reminded of their new fountain.

"If you're looking for a ""no-noise"" filter, I recommend buying a hang-on-back type filter. This canister filter is strong, the motor hums pretty loudly. Been using for 6 months now on a 60 gallon tank with 40 African Cichlids, even with an Aqua Clear 50 as a secondary filter, the xP3 needs bi-weekly cleaning. I have sand substrate and live plants so there is a lot going on. I have to clean it every other week now, the first 3 months it was working flawless without any cleaning. I guess it's time to replace all the media, they're pretty expensive! For the price, it is not worth it! I could have bought 5 x AquaClear 50 and they would have done a way better job!!!",fish aquatic pets,4
I have used the nail grinder 3 or 4 times now on my Boston Terrier and it works great. It is light weight and grinds his nails down in much less time than it would take to cut them. He is not as scared of it as he was of the nail clippers. I love it. I like the fact that it just plugs in too so that I don't have to worry about batteries or the power ever dying down. Great product!,dogs,3
Great thought but product a bit disappointing. As much as you pay for this tiny bit of wax that doesn't even seem to spread smoothly on the paw or stay on- The only good thing going is it has a decent smell compared to the other paw treatments out there.. returned and wouldn't buy again.,dogs,3
"My vet recommended this for my cat (11yr old male - shorthair mix). He's getting pretty old and is starting to have problems with hair balls and sometimes constipation.In the beginning he didn't like the sticky texture and I would have to smear it on his lips to make him eat it, BUT within a week he was hooked on the Tuna flavor and would lick it right off my finger. (The tuna flavor makes it like a ""treat"" for him.) I've tried other types of laxatives but so far this is the only one I can get him to take happily. =)",cats,2

I was skeptical when I first purchased the produce. Now I wouldn't do without it. My 3 cats' behavior is so much better with the Feliway plug ins.

It works great on my gravel 5 gallon tank! the point was not to suck up all the water too fast so I could vacume without changing more than 20% of the water. And it works pretty good. Very good sized hose and good sturdy materials.,fish aquatic pets,4
We got this crate for our great dane puppy. She outgrew the kennel we had and knew we needed something that would accommodate her as she grew to her full size. She is currently 7 months old and this crate is plenty big and should fit her as she reaches full size. She stays in this crate at night so it is good that she has enough room. There is also a tray that is easy to slide out and clean.,dogs,3
"Not only are these bowls durable for rough pets, but they are the perfect size for measuring food. My kids always overfed the dogs and now that almost impossible with these bowls. I also love love love the rubber bottom we can now take this bowl in the boat with us for the dogs to have water and it does not slide from one end of the boat to the other when we are in motion.",dogs,3
The larger quantities are always a better buy. My African Gray loves the Nutri-Berry as a treat and I love the Tropical Fruit mix because the fruit balls don't fly across the room when parrots bite down on them like the non-fruit ones.,birds,0
"This works out perfect for my apt, there wasn't a clear, good place to put a litter box, without seeing everything. So I got this, I was a bit nervous, but it is working out great. She is pretty tiny, like 9 pounds so she fits perfectly, if your cat is bigger than 10lbs, it may be hard for them to squeeze in through the entrance. Definitely works well for me, sits in a corner and you really don't even notice it and I think my cat likes it too because she has her privacy!",cats,2
"My cats can be on a whole different level of the house. I start swinging this thing around and they come running! My cats are both 6 yrs old- every other toy I tried only kept their attention for a minute or two if that... they are very lazy, except with this toy. I wish I could show you a video of two very lazy cats jumping 3 to 5 feet easily when this toy comes out. It is worth every penny. :)",cats,2

"We are buying our third for our dog. (First one was chewed up as our doggie figured out how to get the center piece out!) This purchase is due to the fact that the second one melted in our dishwasher (the interior). IT IS NOT DISHWASHER SAFE. Otherwise, it is a fantastic toy!",dogs,3
I have Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and a couple of them get tear stains badly so I tried this. Two weeks before a dog show we started and by the show they were noticeably faded the almost gone!

"The idea of using recycled newspaper for cat litter is awesome. A great re-use for a used product in ample supply.Unfortunately, as cat litter it falls way short, in my opinion.I've had cats most of my life, usually 2 in the house at the same time since 1988. I've tried both clumping and non-clumping litter for over a decade each. I saw this ""Yesterday's News"" product for the first time about 6 months ago, thought it was a great concept and thought I'd give it a try.The litter is very absorbent, as it claims to be, and also not dusty like clumping litters. But aside from that, it has downsides:--Difficult to find and remove soiled litter. It absorbs but doesn't clump. So getting rid of the urine-soaked pieces versus the non-soiled pieces is a challenge. Ideally you'd like to completely remove the bottom 1/4 inch of litter pieces in the box, but of course that's very difficult. Finding feces pieces is also a bit tough since the litter is similarly-colored.--Very stinky to change. While I did my best to remove used pieces as the box was being used, a lot of them remained and when it came to time change the entire box it was just about the smelliest and most urine-y litter box cleanup job I've ever had to deal with.--Congealed bottom pieces also a challenge. Since it's difficult to remove the used pieces, they would tend to congeal at the bottom of the pan. And for me, trying to scoop that congealed layer would cause the scoop to slip sending litter flying out of the box and all over the floor. Now, I admit there might be better ways to change the whole box, but this was a real bummer for me.So maybe I didn't follow the directions closely enough or maybe I don't *get* it, but no cat litter should be this difficult and unpleasant to use. Therefore I don't recommend this cat litter. It might be good for specific implementations like for folks who truly have bad health problems with other litters' dust or if you have sick cats, but for routine use it doesn't cut the mustard. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because using recycled newspaper is a good concept and it does indeed absorb well. I'll be going back to clumping litters which are easiest and best to use IMHO.",cats,2
"I have had this feeder for years now. I bought it for the same reason others have, because I did not want to be woken up at 5am and because I am away or out fairly often. I could not work out the programming even with the cheat sheet let alone using the instructions actually supplied but my more tech savvy girlfriend got it working in about 30 minutes. Now, when the batteries have run out, which does not happen very often, or when it needs to be reset, say at daylight savings time, I just use the reset button at 12am and only have to adjust the amount of amount per feed, nothing else. That update takes about 3 minutes.Today it started groaning without the wheel turning. Sounds like something was stuck. Luckily I was nearby and have tried cleaning it and rebooting. Hopefully it will keep working but I feel I have my money's worth and will happily buy a new one, if I have to. As I have 2 trips in the next 2 months, it will probably better ensure that it keeps working and my 3 cats are fed...Oh, and one cat can reach in and steal a a piece or two from the next meal every now and then but it has never been a real problem.",cats,2
"On my last visit to the vet, I found out that my cat has tarter on her teeth! I purchased these because the package says that they are a dental treat.

This is the brand I will be purchasing for now on.",cats,2
"This product is amazing! My 11 1/2 yr old great dane had lots of struvite crystals in her urine and a recurring bladder infection. After two rounds of very expensive anti-biotics, my vet wanted to start her on royal canon s/o. But the ingredients looked horrible so I started searching for other options. After reading other reviews, I decided to give it a try. We've been using it as directed for about a month and just had another urinalysis. There were no crystals, no bacteria, the ph was perfect, and it was well concentrated so the vet also reversed her prior assessment that my dog might also have cushings disease! I am soooooo thankful and amazed by how well this product worked!!!",cats,2
"Great for the price. The ""free toy"" included was cute but very cheap and would not stick to the window with the suction-cup provided. My cats were just as happy to play with the feathers once I took them off the pole so it was no loss. The perch itself is very sturdy and comfortable. My cats use it constantly! Highly recommended!",cats,2
"I like the product overall. The buckle and quality is the best that I have seen in hands free leashes - and I have tried several. The elastic leash has quite a bit of give and is wonderful if your dog suddenly goes after something. With most other leashes, the dog can pull you off your feet - but this leash gives enough to allow you time for a correction before the dog can drag you.Would like to see an easier waist adjustment - it is winter now so depending on the size coat I am wearing I have to fiddle each time I use it. The keepers are slightly smaller than the thickness of the belt doubled over so it takes some time to adjust. Because it is difficult to adjust, it isn't snug around my waist which allows it to 'spin' and the leash then interferes with my stride.Would also like an option to adjust the length of the leash - perhaps some D rings or clips at regular intervals down the length. My dog tends to 'wander' as I run, and the longer length allows him to cross directly in front of my path, which always ends nasty. And I am tall...my daughter is shorter and she finds the longer length more annoying. I find myself grabbing the leash and hauling him back along side of me often. I purchased the extension option, thinking it would be smaller and help this, but it is just another leash, and wasn't useful. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have 2 dogs, and then I would consider jusy 'yoking' them together with a split lead at the bottom, versus the extra leash.The phone pouch is nice. Suggest added accessories (like water bottle holder) - as I have a separate belt for that for full-day hikes.Best solution for this type of product that I have seen though.",cats,2
The instructions say to only use on dogs but I figured if it is good for a Yorkie then it is OK for a cat. I hid the wires under the rug so they could not be seen and the cat is limited to the living room and balcony. Do not have to have her get on the dinner table and food counters at any more. A great product.,dogs,3
"These are my favorite water bottles for my birds. Other bottles I have tried with my Quaker Parrots are not as sturdy and the birds find a way to knock the other type bottles off the cage. I think they are not going to have this type available, so I stocked up. I have had my previous purchase of these bottles for a very long time. They work very well for my birds, so I don't know why they decided not to make this type water bottle any more. I guess it is a good thing that they last for a very long time.",birds,0

"This product has been a life saver for me!!! The only reason I rated it as a 4 rather than a 5 is because when we first got it, there was at least 1 time where it didn't turn like it was supposed to in order to feed my cat. But that was only 1 time, about 3-4 weeks ago. Since then, it's been amazing! And it's really easy to use! My cat doesn't bother me about food. Other reviews said their cat broke into it within a few days. We went away for 4 days and when we came back, my cat had tried to claw and bite it to get to his food but was unsuccessful. Occasionally he still bites it because he can smell his food but he can't get into it. I would recommend not putting food in the container or opening it where your cat can see you. I open it up and fill it with food on the counter where he can't see me. My cat is pretty smart and I think if he saw how I opened it, he would be able to get into it.Bottom line",cats,2

"A short summary of our problem cat's life....We have the sweetest, friendliest cat ever. He's part of a multi-cat household. His problems, and ours, began when he was 4 yrs. old. He began showing dominance by chasing our 14 yr old cat until she'd hide from him & he also started marking his territory in our home!! If you're wondering, yes, he was neutered. He's lucky, very lucky, that we are so kind-hearted. Instead of doing away with him, he's been banished to our closed-in porch.Through the years, I tried a couple different enzyme products, but got frustrated with them because I'd have to mix just the right amount of enzyme with just the right amount of warm water, pour on the urine spot, cover with a damp cloth and make sure the urine spot remained wet for a required amount of time. I grew tired of that, and started using white vinegar, but it didn't get all the smell out. Now, 13 years later, I read an article about Anti-Icky-Poo, and decided to go for it. The deciding factor was that it doesn't need to be kept wet. Off and on, in about 6 weeks time, I managed to use a quart of it on some urine spots on our closed in porch. Imagine my surprise when that nasty smell was finally gone from the porch!!! This stuff works! I recently ordered the gallon size & haven't had to use much because I'm also usingFarnam Comfort Zone Feliway Electric Diffuser with 48-Milliliters Imitation Cat Pheromone. My vet sold me some Feliway (75mL) Spray several years ago. I used it a few times but stopped because I wasn't comfortable spraying my furniture and walls with it, & you need to spray often. So, that's when Raskal was banished to our closed-in porch.Using Anti-Icky-Poo and Comfort Zone Feliway Diffuser has almost eliminated our problem...our home is intact and finally our porch doesn't stink. Poor, sweet Raskal is still banished to our porch, which we've made very comfy for him through the years. He even has his own cat house with an incandescent bulb we use to heat it in cold weather. We just can't bring ourselves to trust him in our home any more. Maybe someday I'll be brave, plug in a Feliway diffuser, and give him another chance; after all, I can use Anti-Icky-Poo to clean up his mess. *but I really don't want to be cleaning up that kind of mess in our home**After purchasing Anti-Icky-Poo, I found out that if you have a stubborn or old urine spot, that Anti-Icky-Poo will also work if it's kept wet. So just cover it with plastic, wax paper or tinfoil for a while. You'll use less A-I-P & have quicker results. A.I.P. can also be diluted with up to 3 parts water.Taken from the label",cats,2
"In theory a great idea. I thought my girls would like the privacy of the booda dome, but they won't even go inside it. May be because one small bump (from inside or out) and the dome comes off.

"A friend gave me a sample of this product and I liked it, so I purchased two bags. What a disappointment! The sticks are unevenly sized (some very thin, some very thick, some tall, some short) and smell awful, even through the sealed plastic bag! When my dogs chew them, we can't stand to be in the same room, because the whole room stinks. I don't know why the sticks from the bag I sampled were evenly sized and smelled fine and this order was so different. I will look elsewhere for bully sticks from now on as I need to be able to depend on the quality of the product. My friend also ordered a bag with the same poor results and won't be buying from this company again either.",dogs,3

This Kennel is HUGE!!! We purchased a 48x30x33 for an Akita puppy and to use when he is grown(110-120 pounds). I did not visualize just how large this would be- our 9yr (big guy for his age) 2 yr old son and puppy got in together -said it looked like a playhouse! I really like the divider it has been perfect to house train. The puppy loves it and goes to it to sleep. The kennel is sturdy and easy to assemble -our teenage sons put it together in three minutes. I highly suggest you purchase the casters (3x Midwest Universal Crate casters) so you can move it-we got six(two in a pack) as suggested by other customers with this size kennel- if you don't you will not be able to clean easily around it because it is so large to move. Give it 5 Stars- Great Value!,dogs,3
"We have had our Cat Genie for approximately 5 months now. I have two giant Maine Coons, and their pottying habits match their size. I was forever cleaning two extra large litterboxes before the Cat Genie.We have ours in our laundry room. We had two minor problems, once with the hopper, after 2 months of use. I probably should have cleaned it more often than I have (The company recommends doing so if you have long haired or large cats, both of which mine are guilty as charged.) Secondly, our computer unit never beeped. We didn't realize it should until we were reading the manual again to fix the problem with the hopper.I cannot say enough about the Cat Genie customer service. They are there convenient hours, they answer quickly and are always super helpful. They sent us a new hopper overnight, and when we mentioned the lack of beeping, they sent us a new computer unit overnight too.Structurally, the unit is great, and I love how big the bowl is. My boys have no problems getting in and out. The only thing we can't use is the cover that came with it(I got a combo deal that was on special and included it), because Milo and Connor are too tall for it.If there ever is an issue with the unit, it is easily fixed, and customer service and tech support are right there to help you. For the ease of never having to deal with regular cat litter, and only ocassional dealings with their 'business', I will NEVER EVER not have a cat genie when I have cats.",cats,2

"This harness worked so well in keeping my dog from pulling. He is a very dominant, high-energy lab/Dalmatian mix and even at 13 years wants to run everywhere. I bought this when he was 10, because he gets so excited to walk he just pulls pulls pulls. I combined this with training him to walk back to my side in order to keep from stopping the walk. Unfortunately, though, because this directs the dog to the side, it somehow exacerbated the arthritis in his front left leg. When we used this, he would walk with a pronounced limp not during but after the walk. It's not worth it to cause him pain, so we stopped using it. Other than that, I highly recommend this. I had tried a Halti before this, and the problem with using a Halti on an easily excitable, high energy dog is that he jumps around while using it, and even though he didn't care about the discomfort, I was concerned that he was going to tear up his neck since it pulls on the muzzle, making it easy to turn the head.",dogs,3

"UPDATE:I originally gave this product a glowing review. Not so much this time. When I ordered another one, I received a hanging tunnel with fleece only on the OUTSIDE. The inside is just plastic and is not nearly as pleasing to my rats. They use it sometimes, but they were always in it when it had fleece inside. With the cold weather, this has been a serious disappointment.OLD REVIEW:This hanging tunnel turned out to be much, much better than expected. It has a nice material on the outside, fleece on the inside and some waterproof material between the layers. It is quite soft and washable. My rats like to use it as a tunnel between levels in their cage but also just hang out in it because it's comfortable and high up. Looks like it will last a long time. Highly recommended.It has been six months since I purchased this item. The rats did chew through one of the straps which I was able to change by replacing it with a chain of large paper clips. It took them about two months to do this. They just now started working on the inner fleece. I think the life span of six months for this product is respectable. I am going to reorder now.",bunny rabbit central,1

"This product has worked for me and the people I know who use it. Whether it's for starting a new tank or for use after killing the bacteria bed when medicating a tank. I've seen it cull a nitrite spike and keep new tank syndrome from happening. For larger tanks, a bottle wouldn't last long, but it's definitely worth it. I mean, who wants to wait to start a tank, or who wants to watch their fish die from ammonia or nitrite poisoning. So I would get a 500 mL bottle if you have anything bigger than a 20 or 29 gallon. That way you'll have some to start the tank and some later on, just in case. I've only seen it used for freshwater aquariums.",fish aquatic pets,4

The only flaws were that 2 nails were sticking out. I read in reviews that this could be a problem, so I made sure to check it out before I let my cat play with it. I just put 2 layers of duck tape over the nails to fix that. Other than that, great product. Looks very nice.",cats,2

Within about a minute after dropping the Mag-Float into my tank, the algae on the side of the tank was gone. The product works fantastically, though my fish didn't seem to care for it.Be cautious when cleaning near your rocks at the bottom of the tank. Any particles that get caught in the magnetic pull could scratch the walls. The easiest way to counter this is to pull the portion on the outer wall away from the class and then re-attach it after a few seconds.

She now takes about 20 minutes to eat her food and gets out some of her energy doing it. We fill the ball with her kibble and it fits just fine. The only down side is filling the ball.

"I've had this fountain for about four months now and thought it was going to be great based on the rave reviews. I initially would have left a 5 star review as well until disaster struck.My cat immediately took a liking to the fountain and began drinking from it from day one. No spills, no problems..he simply enjoyed it. I generally changed the fountain one to two times a week and that seemed to do well. One day I went to change it and noticed a lot of algae and tons of WORMS in the reservoir clinging to the filter! It was utterly disgusting and made me want to just throw it all out right then and there. My cat is an indoor cat (he's afraid of the outside!) and worm-free and after looking up several reviews on the filter for this product, I found many other people having the same issue. Here is an example ( http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MH9UQAU4N1GQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm ). I know it's not this brand of filter, but it gives you an idea of what I was experiencing. There is some connection. I don't know where they came from, but some people are saying that the some of the filters may have eggs in it of some sort. I know it sounds like an uncommon problem, but that was enough for me!That night I completely threw away that filter and it took me forever to get rid of the worms that were stuck deep into the crevices that are hard to reach. I even poured rubbing alcohol in there and they were STILL MOVING yuck!I ran it without the filter for the next week. This time around some sort of black mold formed everywhere in this thing. Then, I decided okay, fine one last chance. I began to change it every other day and it's just a pain. No, I did not place it in my dish washer because frankly, I don't believe that will do. Tonight I went to change it and noticed a lot of gunk stuck in the pump (and the water flow is coming out very slowly although I have it set to the max.

"I, like everyone else, heard great stories about this amazing de-shedding tool, so I bought one and have tried it a dozen or so times on my American Eskimo dog. She looks like a giant snowball, an oversized Pomeranian or a miniature Samoyed for those of you who have never seen one - and as you can imagine, she has LOTS of hair and sheds tumbleweeds year round.When I got this brush out of the package, the first thing I did it run it down my own arm to make sure it isn't painful like those pin brushes (which I bet you will stop using once you try them on yourself). It it actually fairly uncomfortable when you test it on yourself, because the blades are very sharp, so even though they are aligned in such a way as to provide a largely flat grooming surface, they still scrape and scratch quite a bit. That being said, dogs have thicker, tougher skin than people (well, most dogs) and can handle a bit more roughness. So I tried it out on my Eskimo.I fully admit that it did work as advertised, for which I'll give it credit. The undercoat comes out little by little, in tiny poofs of wispy hair. If you groom for 15 minutes, you're completely covered in wispy hair that is soft and impossible to gather up and throw away. After 5 minutes she was noticeably uncomfortable,after 10 minutes she was shewing on me and acting fussy, after 15 minutes she started making little whining noises, and after 20 minutes she was practically biting my arm in annoyance. She never likes grooming much, but she really did not care for this tool. It rips the undercoat out in small bits. I wouldn't care for it either if it were me. I did get a lot of hair out of my dog, but she wouldn't come to me for half a day afterward because she appeared to feel mistreated by the grooming session.Each successive session was about the same. I knew I wasn't really hurting her, but rather causing her quite a bit of discomfort, so I made sessions 10 minutes or less after that to minimize the soreness that apparently develops from the tearing out of the fur.",cats,2

The Hamilton Double Thick Nylon Deluxe Collars are quality durable collars that fit my 2 GSD's. The nylon is thick without being overly so and the metal components are heavy duty. The purple and blue colors are very vibrant which I loved. I have purchased similar collars in the past with and without rubberized backing but I prefer the plain ones due to 0 problems with snagging or fraying (I bought these new ones because the old ones don't fit any longer). The kind with rubber-backing just didn't hold up to my dogs rough-housing but they might be ok for more mild mannered or older dogs.,dogs,3
"This is truly a great product. We have bred Rottweilers from quite sometime; however, we decided to add a Mastiff to our family. She is a crier, screamer, etc! For the first 3 days after we got her home, she screamed so much that we contemplated returning her. We were truly at wits end. We have never, in all of our years of breeding, had a dog like her. Then, I remembered from my days as an Operations Manager at Petsmart that they made products with heartbeats in them. I searched every chain and local pet store; no one sold anything like it anymore. I went on to Amazon, and there they were. I paid for next day shipping (my regular 2 day was NOT going to cut it). I set it up, placed it in her cage, and she immediately stopped crying. For the first time since we got her, she slept through the night. I have been contemplating whether I should add this to my puppy sales packs.It included:1. Snuggle Puppy Animal2. 2 sets of batteries (each set last about three days if you leave it on constantly)3. 2 24 heat packs.It only takes a second (with a Phillips screw driver) to set up. The stuffed Snuggle Puppy does tend to get a little smelly; however, you just remove the heart and pop it in the washing machine. No muss, no fuss. After several washes, the Velcro that keeps the ""heart"" inside the Snuggle puppy was completely worn. I decided to buy another puppy. I have also gone to JoAnn and replaced the velcro. It took me a couple of bucks and a little (very little) sewing know-how. Now, we have two. I can wash one, and she has another. This way, she is never without.My only concern is that she is addicted to it. She HAS to sleep with it (she is only 3 months now; however, as a mastiff, she is quite large). When she is sitting in her cage, she sits on snuggle puppy. When she is sleeping, she sleeps on snuggle puppy. I am hoping that, with age, she will become less dependent on him for comfort. In the interim, I don't know what we would have done without him.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WITH A PUPPY WHO IS HAVING A HARD TIME SEPARATING FROM THEIR LITTER/GOING THROUGH CRATE TRAINING/HAS SEPARATION ANXIETY ISSUES!",dogs,3

I have been able to cut down on bathing frequency to 2-3 months from the once a month it used to be. What I really like the most apart from the health benefit of the natural oils is that Mikey and Tony do not have any dog smells anymore. They love to lick the bowl clean after I drop a teaspoon of the oil onto their morning meal once a day.

"Well made, good ventilation and plenty of screening for the pooch to see out of. Took this and our little girl doggie all the way to Puerto Rico and back, she was very comfortable riding around in the Sherpa. Nice feature is the top hatch that can be left open like a sun roof for the pooch to stick her head out of. Very satisfied.",dogs,3
"As the owner of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, I am always trying to locate a feeding/water dish that will work to keep the long ears clean and dry. So I bought these. Tried them one time - and the ears were in the food and water like any regular dish. Also the narrow bowl actually traps the ears closer to the dogs head - ergo - dirty wet ears. Like every other product I have tried for long ears - I won't ever buy again. Actually if you stand by your dog and keep pulling the ears out of the dishes that might work --- but you can do that with regular dishes.......",dogs,3
"I am not sure how people can leave this a bad review. Its a water fountain for your pet, it seems easy to clean and the dog loves it. Its very quiet (i hope it stays that way). I would recommend this to anyone who wants to avoid filling the dogs water bowl every few hours ;)",cats,2

This is a great product. I have a boxer mix. Anyone who owns a boxer knows they usually have loose stool issues and gas issues. My dog has not had either since placing this in her food. I can't promise this will be the case for everyone but I am totally satisfied.,cats,2
"I don't like putting collars around the tiny necks of my dogs, so I like things like this. This is very cute on my little girl and very practical. The only thing is when you wash it, you have to iron it. If you don't mind ironing your dog's clothes, then I would get it.",dogs,3
"This product works great! I use it on my dog's paws so I can walk my dog in the winter without useless doggie boots. The boots never stay on but this product does. It doesn't stain and it is scentless. This is not a product for healing any type of medical condition on dog's paw, pads, etc.! It is a protectant only from hot pavements, salt, ice, snow, and cold conditions.",cats,2
I think it's a great idea. My vet said it really only works in about 60% of dogs and I guess my dog was part of the 40% it didnt work for. Too bad!,dogs,3
As with many cursed shoppers looking at this item I have one or more cats that have been visiting the mulch moat that surrounds my house late at night in order to make their deposits. Aggravating to say the least. I wanted something maintenance free and easy to move around if needed so I tried this. It seemed a bit flimsy and I could not hear its ultrasonic sound at all (too many rock concerts in my youth?) but I gave it a try in a strategic spot. Amazingly it has worked and I have not had to clean up one deposit anywhere on the property. I just hope the cats don't wise up anytime soon. That's when the nuclear option gets chosen!,cats,2

"I bought this for my toy poodle...who promptly chewed the edges into little pieces. The package says that the noise makers have small metal rings, and that your the toy should be taken away from your dog if they start chewing on it...I believe that took about 15 minutes at my house...not worth the price at all! The packaging does not include any guarantee, or phone number to call with a complaint...only purchase this if you dog has no interest in chewing toys.",dogs,3
"My little bulldog puppies love this toy! They usually want to chew on most toys but this one. I am guessing because it is a thick plush. It is well made with good stiching and materials. It machine washes on gentle cycle great. It has been a wonderful toy to interact with pups or to let them have at it alone while watching in amusement. The bellies of the ""squirrels"" is the noise maker which is very easy for the puppies to squeak much to their delight. They have even learned to bring them to me to re-insert them back into the stump for them to take out again.Caution if your pet goes crazy on pulling the squeakers out of toys as there is no stuffing around the noise maker which will make it easy to get to.I have purchased this item for several family and friends (of different breeds) with positive feedback from all.HIGHLY RECOMMEND",dogs,3
"I ordered this for my 95lb Doberman Vito. I thought it would be larger but I suppose I under estimated the size of my own boy. As soon as I took it out of the packaging Vito had to have it. He loves it and all though it's a bit too small for him, he will not give it up. It's of great quality and washes very well. Definately recommend for your puppy.",dogs,3

"The set up was really easy. Now to the issues... We have a cat and a medium sized, 45 pound, Chow Chow. We hoped that this would allow the cat to come and go as he pleases and keep our dog in the appropriate areas of the house. My dog has no problem getting in and out of that tiny door. We were shocked when he waltzed to the other side of the gate. Also, the tension is not strong enough to hold up to my dog jumping on it when we come home and consequently knocking it over without the little cups you have to nail into the wall.",dogs,3

"I really loved this collar - and it worked well with my year old Chocolate lab. But I noticed that where the collar lays on his face - it is rubbing his hair off! He's too cute to have a face with a mark! So, I am going to discontinue using it with the hopes that his hair on his face will grow back! I wish the nylon around the face was made a little softer. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem?",dogs,3
"After trying 3 types of cat window shelves (all fell within minutes of the cat getting on them), decided to get one of these instead--added bonus was the scratching post since their old one came unraveled). It's nicely heavy so the cats can't tip it over, post is 35"" tall so it gives the cats enough length to really go at it, post is covered in sisal not carpet (huge plus for that). Originally after buying got a message that said it'd take about 3 months to get to us, which was fine, but it was suddenly there after only 2 weeks. The only problem is whenever the little female cat gets up on the cradle, the male no matter what else he was comfortably snuggled into has to get up and chase her off. I'd get another one but we don't have any more room. I thought the cats would be uncomfortable in the cradle since it isn't cushioned (just plain carpet) but they don't seem to mind at all. Male is too long for the cradle so part of him stick out--but he doesn't care. Female fits in it tidily. It's well made, well thought out, and we're all very happy with the product.",cats,2
"My puppy enjoyed playing with this toy, chewing on the crinkly flags. However, it did not even endure one week of his baby teeth!At first, I thought, ""Oh well, he has sharp teeth,"" but then I stopped myself--this *is* a teething stick for dogs, after all! Shouldn't it be made more durable?",dogs,3
"Good curry for short hair dogs too-I use it on my boxers head, legs, and bellies. I think this would be a good curry for small short hair breeds like Pugs and Bostons. It grabs loose hair well and has a curved side and flat side-the curved side is good for the legs.",cats,2
"I have ordered many tubes of Viralys gel over this last year and found it made a great base for adding powder supplements to be syringed for my cats. This last order I received of 2 tubes, I noticed immediately that the color has changed to a very pale yellow instead of the orange-y color it used to be and the ""liquidity"" is now like that of thick hair gel! What is even more disturbing is that the ""liquidity"" is DIFFERENT in the 2 tubes I received! This would indicate a lack of quality control and a legit reason to be concerned about the integrity of this product at this time. 05/13/09",cats,2

"When I feed my fish even my turtles nibble at it all the time everyone loves this stuff. This kinda outa the other Tetra fish food provides the most nutritional diet and while feeding the water is much cleaner/clear, no more light amber tint,(amber tint settled after 5mins of the filter being turned back on so it wasn't bad). Also if you have shrimp, not glass bc you wont tell, but you have green or cherry shrimp it makes them pop with color just after 5-7days of eating it makes your aquarium look awesome.

"I purchased this on the advice of my dog trainer. My dog pulls terribly when we walk on a regular collar, but with this he really can't. It takes a lot of patience to size the harness correctly and get your dog used to wearing it. If you're not willing to put in the time, this product probably is not for you. For the first few weeks the dog's instinct is to get it off, but lots of treats and praising got him ready for walks. We've been using it for about 6 weeks and he still will try to get it off his nose if i don't keep him distracted. When something really gets his interest he yanks against me, but quickly figures out it's better to cooperate with me because he can't win in a fight against this harness. Overall it's made our walks much more pleasant and enabled me to teach him to talk with a loose leash, which means eventually we'll be able to phase the harness out.",dogs,3
"Had I read the reviews more carefully I probably wouldn't have ordered this. But I'm glad I did read them before I tossed the hinge out. My glass is 1/8"" thick and there was no way in the world this was going on. When I went back online to find another one to order I did read the reviews and decided to try cutting the ridges out--nothing to lose. I used a razor blade cutting tool and cut off the two ridges on only one side of each half of the hinge. It was a snug fit, but I got the hinge attached without too much difficulty. I could have cut off the other side but I was afraid it might be too loose. I wonder if the ridges are supposed to be softer and more flexible, but whoever is manufacturing them is making the ridges very ""rigid"" instead.",fish aquatic pets,4
"If you have a male dalmatian, please be very cautious in giving this to him. My 14-year-old male developed urinary stones after a few weeks on this supplement. It is made with liver, beans and brewers yeast, all high in purines. Purines and stone formation are a problem for dals and a few other breeds. The supplement worked just as well as the much more expensive anipryl I was giving.",dogs,3
"My cats love it! My little girl (1 yr old) sits there and waits for me to put the oil on her food, otherwise she just isn't interested in eating. She's a picky eater, and would rather not eat than eat something sub-par.I gave a bottle to my parents who have a 19 year old cat. That old girl has problems with just about everything, including keeping her fur clean. Once she started eating her food with salmon oil on it, we noticed that her fur definitely got a healthier sheen to it. While we're not sure if it's actually improving her quality of life, she does get her bouts of playfulness on a more regular basis than before.",cats,2

"We got some samples from a local pet food store after the spoiled chi's had just about trained us that table food was all that they would eat. They all like this duck/sweet potato dry (with some table scrap meat).A couple of days ago we found canned Fromm (various varieties) & started to mix this with the dry. Surprise, surprise--after a few minutes of looking at me with the ""where is the good stuff"" look, they ate it. We change the flavor of the canned (after a can is used up) and mix it with the duck/potato dry and thats all they get now--(well except for some treats every now & then).",dogs,3
its sturdy and has a simple design which makes it economic and affordable it was kind of difficult to assemble as the instructions left too much room for guessing and it make sure you have 2 people assemble it because its extremely hard to keep the sides vertical while adding the top panels. other than difficulty assembling it has been great its huge so any dog bigger than a lab is probably gonna be comfortable in it and even our little shi-tzhu tucker finds himself comfortable in it with tons of extra space can't wait to see how our giant schnauzer takes to it though.,dogs,3
"I purchased a SnuggleSafe for use in my outdoor dog's dog house. She has a pad and a sleeping bag in the house, but some nights get pretty chilly here in Tennessee. I was so pleased with the first SnuggleSafe I bought another. They retain their heat for up to 16 hours (I have found one stays hotter longer, but both stay quite warm from dusk 'till dawn). They're easy to use, and if you tuck them under the animal's blanket or comforter, you'll find the hardness of the SnuggleSafe shouldn't interfere with the animal's comfort. My dog Lady Bug (a Southern Cur, about 65 pounds) loves them and I feel comfortable knowing she has an extra source of safe warmth. I don't think I'd recommend this product for use with puppies as they have a tendency to chew anything, and the SnuggleSafe IS made of plastic. But for an adult dog, an outdoor dog or an animal who needs extra warmth to soothe old joints, I highly recommend this product. Heats in the microwave in about 5 minutes, is easy to clean and store.",cats,2
"When I received this, the inside box containing the item was broken in several places with the metal poking through the box. There was no set-up, which was nice but the legs are quite wobbly. I wish there was a way to fix this but I cannot seem to find one. All in all, the 'diner' will do for us and our dog is much happier now (after her first night with it) that she is not eating off the floor. I really enjoy that this design is not bulky and takes up minimal space. I hope it remains in tact and there are no further issues.",cats,2

With the rep on the phone, I pressed the start cycle and the arm came down but the bowl did not spin. Luckily the rep said it might have gone off alignment during shipping and asked me to help the bowl to spin. I did, and it worked like a charm. To watch it was fascinating. (Note",cats,2

"I have a Jack Russell Terrorist. She's amazing but there is no off switch on the bitch. Fetch is her favorite pastime, and she can literally play ball for a good hour, hour and a half and still be ready for more (and by then I need a cocktail!) I had always used tennis balls which get saturated with dog drool (ew) and get torn into pieces within a few days. At 99 cents a piece I was spending more on tennis balls than I was on said cocktails! So when I saw the Chuckit Ultra Ball at seven bucks I figured, what the hell, let's give it a shot. I bought 6. Guess what - the little Terrorist loves them. I mean, L-O-V-E-love-love-loves them. She actually likes them more than the felt tennis balls... something about their rubbery texture I think. She actually plays with them on her own, it's adorable. And believe it or not, we're three months later and I've still got 6 Ultra Balls!!! And they look like they did on the day I unwrapped them, no holes or marks or scuffs or any sign of distress. We have a winner!!!",dogs,3

They didn't feel very substantial when I received them and I scoffed at their waterproof abilities after inspecting the green underpad but I was elated to discover how absorbant these are and there is no leakage from the bottom.Iris Neat'n Dry always left moisture on the underside, I was lucky because I have hardwood so I could mop after I removed the pad, if I had carpeting this would have been a deal breaker. Now, I feel confident that these particular pads can go from hardwood to carpet without any problems whatsoever.Awesome product, takes about a week or so to be delivered so don't run out and think they'll come like super saver shipping.

"This thing has been invaluable. Others thought that I was being very cruel when purchasing this, but it has proven that our Rat Terrier can be very well behaved if he chooses to! Before, he would not listen at the dog park, and would run across the park, and not come back, ignoring me, and fighting with the larger dogs. He was the ill-behaved one, not them! It only took a few small shocks combined with the tone and me telling him NO, for him to figure out that is unacceptable. Now, if he is getting out of line, I just hit the tone, and he is IMMEDIATELY doing what he is supposed to be doing. The best thing is, is that it has proven that he knows what he is supposed to be doing, and that he just chooses not to do it! I do not use the ""positive tone"" at all. That just confused him. I use praise instead (DUH). I have the setting on ""2"". I used it on myself at that setting, and its just like a little pin-prick. All you have to do, is break the dogs train of thought, IMO.

Just check it every other day or so to empty the waste receptacle and clean the rake.Only problem is, it worked great for about a year (the length of the manufacturer's warranty) and then broke down on me & my felines! The rake would get so far and when it got to the point where it had to lift the waste it would get stuck and make this loud clicking noise until you pushed the rake the rest of the way.

"I originally had a seat cover from Cabella's that sucked. It was so thin and cheap, if your dog had any dirt or sand on it (which, when do they NOT have dirt on them?), it'd just sift through the seat cover onto you cars upholstery. Kinda defeats the purpose of the seat cover. I did a lot of research, including paying $300+ for a custom bench seat cover for my car, but finally decided on the Solvit. I'm very happy with my purchase. So happy, in fact, I'm ordering another one for our 2nd car.It attaches firmly and seems like it'd have a lot of options for different types of bench seats. It's also pretty thick so dirt doesn't go thru it. I have yet to wash it. I also like that it covers the whole seat. My other seat cover only covered 1/2 the back of the seat so hair would sneak it's way down between the seat cover and the cars upholstery.",dogs,3

"My cat loves to chase lasers around, it's actually the only toy she'll play with. I have a hand held one that she loves to chase around, if I even move it she'll come running from wherever she is in the house.This one sucks, all it does is rotate around in a continuous oval pattern, at a speed that makes it look almost like a solid line instead of a pointer. It moves too fast for the cat to stay interested in, and it does the exact same pattern over and over again, stopping once in awhile. If you put it up higher, then you can get a larger pattern, but it still goes around too fast for the cat to stay interested in. This toy was a waste of money. The only time my cat wants to play with it, is when it stops at certain points, then she'll run to that spot, but then it is gone before she can get interested, just when it catches her interest it starts spinning too fast for her to see a pointer, and it is back to almost a solid line again. I would look at the Frolicat bowling pin shaped one, from what I see in the video it seems to move slower and more randomly. It is a little more expensive, but when you consider your cat won't play with this one, then it is cheaper. I am going to try to return this one to Petco, and get the Frolicat one.",cats,2

"I have two huskies that prefer to be outside, and I always worry about them when it gets warmer, but they hate being confined inside the house during the day. I debated on getting this bed because they are 9 and 11 years old and didn't know if they would like a raised bed after all these years, so I only purchased one initially.Set up was very simple, and as soon as I put it down they both climbed on it! I knew right away I needed two beds so I ordered the next the same day. Shipping was incredibly fast too. Now both dogs spend more of the day relaxing on their cot beds, and I'm so happy they seem so comfortable. It's light weight and easy to move as they day progresses as they like to lay in the sun in the morning, and I move them to the shade as it gets warmer.My only concern is the bed material seems like it could snag and tear pretty easily so I will keep an eye on it. There are replacement covers available. The green is more of a darker green than shown in the photo, it goes with landscaping well. It does stretch out with a few uses so my bigger dog has a little sag in his bed.Dallas and Bella are relaxing side by side in their beds now, and I'm a happy mom.

However, none, NONE of my 4 cats will drink from it! It might be the slight sound from the pump, or the vibration, or just the oddity of water sliding down the dome, I don't know. But in all good conscience I wouldn't recommend this product to a cat owner. Dogs would probably do fine with it.",dogs,3

"I just got this LENTEK/KOOLATRON 6 DAY AUTOMATIC PET DISH a couple of days ago & it works great so far. The motor isnt loud enough to scare my cat, it holds plenty of kibbles, looks easy to clean (it was a bit hard to unassemble to put in the battery tho.) The only problems I have with it is that the dish is soooo big (it measures 14.8 x 14.5 x 4.1 inches which is way too big for my apartment kitchen), & my cat has to walk around the dish to eat her kibbles because of the cover rotation.I bought this automatic pet dish (along with an Animal Stuff Lucy cat tree) on the recommendation of my vet who said my chubby kitty needed some exercise. After her spaying she gained a lot of weight & now looks a bit like a basketball lol. The vet said an automatic feeder was a necessity for all cats living in apartments. He told me to somehow anchor the pet dish on the top shelf of the pet tree to make my kitty climb up to her food for exercise.I havent received the cat tree yet, but I highly doubt I can anchor this huge food dish to it.I do wish they made a smaller automatic pet dish for cats tho. Thanks for the good price/free shipping Amazon. :)",cats,2

i have been using this for over two years on my 18 year old terrier dog. the vet told me two years ago that she had maybe one year to live from kidney failure. i've used this along with a kidney diet dog food and have had much success. i can really tell that she feels much better when i use epakitin once in the morning and once in the evening. my dog is now suffering more from age related problems vs. kidney failure. i would highly recommend using this product as soon as you know your dog/cat is having kidney problems....the sooner the better.,cats,2

well I tried this..I hate cleaning the litter box and hat all the litter the cat tracked..and thought this would be the solution for me..it was not. I was able to get her to use it for a little bit..but the flush able litter I bought seemed to make the urine stay we and because it is not deep the urine could not go down but would be a wide wet spot...so the cat would not poo in it if she had already peed...we would put her up at night and shut the door..and just when we thought she was getting it there would be poo in the toilet..after we cut out a ring or 2...we found out she was using the sink to pee in...we just assumed she was peeing in the toilet as well...she began to branch out and pee in the laundry room in the laundry basket on a car seat we took out of the car..in the corners of closets...and the she decided to stop pooing in the toilet..luckily it was on the bathroom floor...well she won! we gave up and I am still doing urine laundry from the basket and hoping they are from before we brought back her litter box...well we spent 20something on the CitiKitty30something on the flush able litter20something on a blacklight that would not show up the urine anyway30 on a gallon of urine cleaner..and we may need moreHarriett please forgive us,cats,2

The bulemic cat was really in bad shape and now he's leaping around like a kitten. Our other cat gets elder-cat Hill's and fools the vet into thinking she's 8. She is 16.

"I have been using frontline plus on my cats for years. Unfortunately, I bought some on Amazon that was packaged in S. Africa. You must read the sellers feedback. Not every seller sells this product packaged in a different country. First of all, the photo of the grey cat on the box was not the ones I received. Mine had a tabby cat. That was my first clue something was different. It was packaged in S. Africa. The ingredients were listed in ml. rather than percentages. I e mailed the seller, who was wonderful, and helped me figure out if the ml. ingredients equaled the percentages on the boxes packaged in U.S. No they weren't! They were off by a little, but I wouldn't take the chance and give my cats the wrong dosage. I returned them and received a refund. Do not be deceived by the photo of the cat on the box being sold. It might not be the same as what you receive. The frontline plus was sent from Australia, even though the seller is in U.S. It also did not have an EPA# on it! If sold in U.S., it must have an EPA#. Your best bet is to check around online.Ask questions! Does it have an EPA# is the first question to ask. You can get good prices on frontline plus from Australia, so why pay more from a regular dealer if it's being shipped from there anyway? The box should say Made In France. I hope this helps a few people. Make sure the ingredients are listed in % not mil.",cats,2

"I was enthralled with the litter robot when I first got it, but it is not without its problems. I am on my second one, and I am getting rid of it, going back to the regular scooping method. The basic design of the Litter Robot is genius, but I think they should develop the Litter Robot 2, or the ""Litter Android"" or something.Firstly, if you have cats, you know that when they scratch around their litter box, some litter gets spilled on the floor. With the litter robot, you don't have to worry about this, because it automatically spills litter all over the floor so your cats don't have to worry about doing it. Every time it rotates, a small amount of litter gets spilled out of the opening. If you don't clean this up everyday, it adds up, leading your cat to believe that it can go on the floor.Also, it doesn't get stuck often but when it does, the lights start blinking, and there doesn't seem to be anything you can do to get it going again. You have to lift the globe up, clean poo and litter out of the gears, and then hope it works. Sometimes it gets stuck when it is half way done rotating, and then it will sit there blinking until you fix it. If this happens while you are getting ready to go to work, its no small task to get it going again, and then you go to work smelling like litter. If your cat gets to it before you have a chance to fix it, he or she is going to go on the floor. If you are buying this so you can handle poo less, this is decidedly inconvenient. You need to have access to a hose to really clean this thing out. Unless you want to get in the tub with it and use the shower head, which sounds pretty gross to me.The biggest problem, and the main reason I am getting rid of mine is that my one of my cats is too big for the litter robot. He can't get in it and turn around inside it, so he sticks his rear end out of the opening and sometimes drops his poo on the little platform, or on the floor next to the box.If the people at Litter Robot are reading, you need to do the following to improve your product. Lengthen the opening into a short tunnel, so that the litter won't spill out all over the floor every time it rotates. Also, the globe itself needs to be a big bigger. Also my first litter robot failed in the following way",cats,2

He walked around for hours with one of the squirrels in his mouth, then finally sat down and proceeded to tear it up and eat the stuffing. It made him terribly sick and was a real mess to clean up. Much to his dismay, I had to take this toy away from him for his own good. I do not recommend this toy, at least not for this breed of dog.",dogs,3
"My dog loves his bed, but it took 6 months before he ever used it. I bought this for my old dog thinking it would be more comfortable on her arthritis, but she didn't use it. She died a month after I got this. I hoped that her younger ""brother"" would use it. After six months, much encouragement and praise every time he would step on it, it has become his favorite bed. When I look outside I can be sure Bear is on his bed (that is when he isn't running and playing). So if you get this bed, it might take encouragement for your dog to use it. But it is worth it! It is easy to clean, and on muddy days it keeps Bear up off the ground, and he stays cleaner. That alone makes it worth every penny, but it is satisfying seeing him laying on it like it is his thrown.",cats,2
"I have a large dog and wanted to provide him with water when he's in his crate. I chose this bottle because of its size. At 1/2 gallon, it will last for about 1 1/2 to 2 days.Some other reviewers have complained about leakage. My experience has been that it will drip for a minute or two when it's just been filled, as it hasn't yet built up enough vacuum to hold the water in. You can help this along by inverting the bottle and squeezing it once or twice prior to attaching it to the crate, which will build up a vacuum. I used to do that, but I don't anymore because (1) it doesn't drip that much water anyway, and (2) my dog sees the dripping and comes right on over and drinks from the bottle and then it doesn't drip anymore.I'm very happy with the product and will buy another when this one wears out.",dogs,3

"This Booda Box is SUPER. I have 4 cats and one of them is fastidious to the point of not wanting to use the litter box after his roommates have; read that as ""too many roommates so I think I will poop on the floor"". So I got the Booda box for him and keep it separate away from the others. As soon as I set it up, he claimed it by rubbing all over the doorway. It is BIG and roomy; with an easy to open top for cleaning. It took me a minute to figure out how to install the filter because there are no instructions, but once I got it together, it made an attractive space age addition to the room. Very nice and I might have to get a few more in different colors. It just so happens the room it's in is PURPLE (not MY choice) so it's decorator approved.The steps make me want to sit down with some toy cars and play like a kid--but, of course, that's just too silly. It's very neat looking; and neat is the operative word. There's no litter being kicked on the floor because it's totally contained. Good invention.",cats,2

I STRONGLY recommend that you wrap the wand in electrical tape to prevent this issue. The manufacturer really should fix it.

"I am raising my third Golden Retriever, and this time, decided to try this product -- had it handy just as my puppy arrived. In the past, I had used a traditional crate for night, and a cage during the day. This pen is just great with the 8 panels, as you can start with few panels, and add them as the puppy grows. Changing the configuration takes just seconds. This product is very well designed and constructed. My puppy is now 5 months old, and at 45 pounds, this pen still works well. While she has more freedom as she is more responsible, the pen is still handy for time outs, when you can't supervise her, and now at night I put this pen around her new dog bed -- to contain her in our bedroom at night. It's fantastic. I have piece of mind that she is safe, and she likes it -- feels secure. I do recommend that as the puppy is being house trained, use fewer panels, to discourage accidents -- I learned that one the hard way. This product will make your life and your puppy's life much easier. It's always a hard slog with a puppy, but at 5 months life is good, and this product helped a lot.",dogs,3

"We own two dogs- each about a year and a half old. One is a boxer/lab mix and the other a lab/hound mix. Both about 50lbs and both love to take each of US for a walk (heavy pullers). We tried a regular harness- but that showed no difference in their pulling (we would always come home frustrated at the dogs insistence to pull throughout our walks). We tried a Gentle Leader with one of our dogs- and while it did make a difference (less pulling) our dog really disliked it (kept trying to paw it off and lots of head shaking)- in addition, the look of a dog on a Gentle Leader sometimes implies the dog may be aggressive (almost has a negative connotation).Finally we tried this product. While skeptical at first (it appears to look exactly like the harnesses we've owned before), we were soon proven wrong. This product is truly incredible. We can now WALK with our dogs- and they seem to be walking comfortably with us. Granted- they will pull when they know we're close to the dog park (or if a squirrel crosses our path)- but that's just excitement, and totally understood. But this product really works and we highly recommend for any dog owners with heavy pullers.",dogs,3
"We used to have a comforter draped over our couch but one of our dogs kept pulling the stuffing out. Now we have one of these. The dogs leave it alone, it is large enough to cover all but about 2 inched of our 9 ft couch, it isn't ugly, it was cheap, and shipping was super fast.",dogs,3

"Coolaroo Large Steel-Framed Pet Bed, Brunswick GreenSold by Amazon.com LLC (Amazon.com)The LARGE is PERFECT for our 100lb Black Lab ""Onax"" I was worried it would be to small for her and she wouldn't be able to stretch out, the pictures online DO NOT do the bed justice, it is PLENTY enough room and then some for her. So if ""Mr.Leo"" our Chichuahua wants to lay with her he can and still will be plenty of room. It says on the box (doesn't online) For Large Dogs- Dalmation, Dobermann, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Rottweiler etc.I didn't find it hard at all to set it up, went together in less than 10 mins and I(female) did it by myself :)I see what some people mentioned in their review, once the bed is put together and all the screws are tight, it ""LOOKS"" like the bed or metal is twisted...it's just from the tension of the material. Once you place the bed on the flat surface, it is fine and it is level. It's perfect :)Very happy with this product!",cats,2

"My two dachshunds are nuts about these lamb lung treats. And I must say that, overall, they are MY favorite dog treats too, because ..... a one pound bag lasts a VERY long time and therefore is very economical, the pieces are easy to break up into any size you need for training, they are a natural lambMerrick Lamb Texas Hold' Ems, 1 lb bagproduct with a genuine aroma of roast lamb, the dogs NEVER get tired of them, you can carry pieces in your pocket and they won't stink or fall apart (but the dogs sure know they're there!).

"I was excited to get this and loved the way it looked however it is made of very thin materials. The walls were like wafer board. Couldn't have been over 1/4"" thick if that much. For the cost, I would have expected better quality. And with it being as thin as it was, my dog had the whole front chewed off in less than a week. :( So, I am looking for a way to salvage this one or in the market for another dog house. Probably better if I get the plans and materials and make myself.",dogs,3

"I received this item very quickly which I was super happy about, but putting it together was a whole different story. First, you definitely need 2 people to assemble this and a word to the wise, MAKE SURE THE CGAE PROPERLY FITS TOGETHER BEFORE YOU BOTHER WITH THE STAND!I learned that the hard way, because after about an hour and a half of taking everything out of the box, trying to understand the picture with no words directions and finally putting the stand together by myself to come to find out the cage doesn't fit AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!! The cage pieces were bent, they didn't fit together to form a cage on the stand or in general. I was so upset that over 2 hours of attempting to put this together, it wouldn't work! I'm sure I got a defective piece and Amazon was willing to replace it, but after this experience I didn't want to chance it. I loved the concept of it and it had the features of everything I was looking for but it didn't work out. Maybe you can take your chances with it and hopefully get a good result, but as for me that was about 3 and a half hours I will never get back.",birds,0

"We have a pug who does not know how to walk on her leash and after trying several products, we've finally found the one that works. I've tried a lot of ""training"" harnesses that she simply does absolutely nothing. Unlike most other dogs, she also has no snout so she cannot wear things like a gentle leader nor training collar or any collar due to the fat that they can easily develop collapsed tracheas. I do admit that this harness is a little bit hard to figure out at first; however, once you get the hang of it, it works very well. Make sure that it is on your dog properly and snug. This is an absolute must for pug owners.",dogs,3

It seems very sturdy and well-made.",dogs,3
This product works as advertised. It seemed kind of expensive until I tried it. It removes an amazing amount of undercoat and will pay for itself easily in grooming bills.

"So I previously had the plastic version of this PetSafe door. We used for several years and it served us well enough, although it probably ended up costing us hundreds in extra energy costs, but at least our cats could get to and from the screened in porch easily.We had a new door installed during a recent home renovation and had to decide whether to keep the old plastic PetSafe or upgrade to something better. I looked around quite a bit, online and at local home improvement stores. To my surprise, I really didn't see anything better.I decided to go ahead and order this Aluminum version, my logic being that an aluminum pet door was probably better than the plastic version I had. Right?So was it better? Well, the plastic door insert that comes with this aluminum door is better because it has a small metal locking mechanism, so it is slightly more secure than the plastic insert of our previous version. I liked the tinted door flap, which makes it more difficult for people outside the door to see light from inside the house. That also seems to offer slightly better security. The aluminum frame is not really that ornate, however, with screws and metal bolts clearly visible. It looks reasonable once installed however.The seal is about the same as the plastic version, but the magnet that keeps it in place is smaller. The stripping on the sides also pick up cat hair like crazy and really need to be cleaned daily. We didn't have this problem with the plastic version side stripping.Others have mentioned this, but let me put this issue to rest",cats,2
"I have 2 cats who would run as soon as they saw a brush! We tried 3 different styles before the furminator. As soon as I started brushing the cats their purrrrr motors started running! They LOVE being brushed now! One of my cats is a short-hair with a thick coat and this brush gets out so much of the undercoat. Our other cat has a medium length, fine coat and sheds terribly. The brush doesn't seem to get quite as much of his undercoat but has still helped tremendously with the shedding. I'm so glad I spent the money on this brush.",cats,2

"I've had this product for awhile, I wanted to wait to really put it to the test before I wrote a review. I trapped a feral barn cat this morning. She needed to be spayed, de-wormed, etc. When I went in the barn and saw the cat in the cage, she was not happy. She was hissing, spitting, rocking the cage, sticking her paws out as best she could to try and scratch me. Typical behavior of a feral cat who had never come into contact with humans. I had the cage covered with a towel. I sprayed this spray on the towel covering the cage, on the cage itself and I think I even got some on her. Within two minutes, this cat was quiet and somewhat calm. She still hissed a little when I was walking with the cage, but her behavior had dramatically improved. I then sprayed a little on the carpet floor of the car and I was able to drive this feral cat in the cage down to my local vet. She didn't make a sound and she hardly moved. I'm sure part of that was fear, but I have to believe the spray helped to keep her calm. If this spray can help to calm a feral barn cat, I think it could help with domesticated cats. And this brand is much cheaper than the typical brand you see in the vet office.",cats,2

"I work nights coming home in the dark hours in the morning. When I take the dog out for a quick walk before going to bed, I want to know where she is.

"I bought the litter locker when they first came out years ago. It reminds me of the product that stores soiled baby diapers. In the same way, it seals away the odor from the clumps of litter and makes it possible to go for a week or more without moving the clumps of litter out to the garbage. The bags don't breathe at all, so once the lid closes, the smell is gone. When you want to take it to the garbage, you cut the bag leaving enough room to tie a knot. I use Fresh Step litter, and it lasts longer than any I've tried, especially when you put the clumps daily into the litter locker. There's no parts to break. Tis wonderful - try it!",cats,2

I had a lot of problems with this product and I ended up returning it anyway.

"I have the large Petmate waterer and I love that one. The pump went out after about four years of continuous use. When I saw the price on the linen colored one, I thought instead of buying another large, I'd try this medium size.Maybe it is the item I have vs. the entire medium size, but the top is extremely hard to take off, the reservoir doesn't empty very quickly, and the water flow seems to be all or very little. Furthermore the depth of the drinking well is so shallow that the water level drops so quickly that I have to check it several times a day to make sure there is enough water for the pump to work efficiently. And as other reviewers have noted, it seems to get dirty faster than it should.The reason I gave it a two star rating rather than a one star is because I took the pump out of it and replaced the nonworking one in my large Petmate which I would give five stars to vs. this highly inefficient medium one! Who knew that there was such a difference between a medium and a large water fountain from the same manufacturer and same line?",cats,2

I ran into this CD in the oddest store ToyRUs and thought I'd give it a try cuz I noticed my dogs *Especially Maggie* goes through Separation Anxiety whenever we leave. So I've heard putting on classical music calms them but I couldn't find a Classical Music radio station. Once I got the CD home and played it ... my dogs instantly calmed down and went into what seemed like a trance like state. They were just laying down in their bed just chillin like a cucumber. I'd recommend this CD to anyone with Hyper dogs or Any dog if that ! It's also soothing to listen to for the owners as well. :D,dogs,3

We got it because Phoenix has always loved running water, and usually stuck her paws in the water bowls to stir it up before drinking, thus getting their water dirty. We figured she'd appreciate the constantly running water, and we were correct -- she and Lenny do love it. WE love the black and steel design, which goes with our master bedroom, and how quietly it runs.

I recently have mixed Tidy Cat Crystals in with it and have found a perfect combination. Half of a small bag of Feline Pine with one third of the jug of Tidy Cat Crystals for one cat for two weeks. It doesn't stick to the feet and track like the scoopables, it swells and turns to sawdust as it's used and the smell is very limited especially if you use a covered litter box with swinging door. I don't scoop or do another thing to it until it's time to dump, rinse, and start all over. You will find some saw dust outside of the litter box at the end of the two weeks but not tracked all through the house. It is the best!",cats,2

It works better than any other brush I've used, and has greatly reduced the animal hair in our home.

It's not as fluffy as when we first got it, because of years of her chewing at the fur, and the stuffing has been pushed to both ends of the toy so that it's just fabric in the middle, but the squeaker still works, there's been no rips in the seams, and the rabbit still has all four legs and both ears!

My dog is still a pup at 6 months and even though he's had some puppy training he remains very stubborn. I've tried a regular collar and an underarm harness and he fights them both. He's strong enough to drag me behind him and our walks weren't pleasant. The Gentle lead has changed how he responds to me when walking. He does pull occasionally but can be corrected when I gently tug on the leash. This is a great training aid to teach him to heel and sit.

"I've used this leash for three dogs now and although I've bought replacements in new colors, the first one still works as well as the most recent purchase. I will recommend keeping the leash shorter if you have a very active dog or if your dog becomes excited or agitated around other people or animals, as they can move very quickly and get away from you. It's also important to be cautious when the leash is extended if the dog runs around people because the leash can actually cut through a body with friction. Once you get comfortable with the button mechanism, your reflexes improve and the walks are more wonderful because the dog can feel more free with the additional space around them. I considered buying another of the very small size but found the handling to not be as comfortable as this. I love all of mine!",dogs,3

I think maybe being off of his leash and free to run around the yard will help him to lose weight. He is sure a CHUB!",dogs,3

"My cats love the Drinkwell. I've had it for almost two weeks now. It took them less than a day to get used to it and drink out of it. The first couple hours after it was set up were hilarious because one cat was so upset about the water he kept trying to hit it with his paw but got wet instead. Anyway, they drink so much water now, I've noticed. My only problem is I have to keep refilling the base every couple of days because the reservoir never empties out. It just stays in the container and sits there. I don't understand why it does that. I even moved it to another portion of carpet to make sure it wasn't an issue with the floor being uneven. Does anyone have suggestions? I've gone through the FAQ at the drinkwell site and there is nothing regarding the reservoir not properly working. Any suggestions are very welcome.",cats,2

These bags are ""welded"" which is amazing. So nothing gets throught these bags. I use two in my 100gal. I love that you can regenerate the Purigen beads. You can only regenerate them a handful of times (I've regenerated them 3 times so far) but you will get your moneys worth. I buy about 4 bags of the 100ml to not have any downtime for filtration.

"Our puppy loves this toy. He sleeps with it in his crate. He has chewed, tugged and dragged it all over the place for 2 weeks and so far no visible damage. He seems proud of himself when he sets off the ""Oooh Nooooo!"" sound. I am going to buy another one as insurance, because eventually even a well made toy like this will come apart.",dogs,3

"Tried this after reading all the rave reviews. Works pretty good until the plastic clips broke off. Now basically useless.I can see why some people like this when it works. I thought the one of the flaws was that there is no way to put plastic lining so clumps of pee would stick to the bottom, requiring frequent cleanings. Thats when my clips broke.I went with the tidy cat breeze and will never go back to these other types of litter boxes.",cats,2
"I was so excited to get this litter box:I have 3 cats and hoped it would be easier than scooping. Was I ever wrong. The litter leaks out, the latches will not stay locked and I spend more time sweeping up litter than I did scooping. Wish I hadn't thrown the box away I would send it back tomorrow. I got it December 22, 2009.",cats,2
"I ran out of Angel's Eyes and bought another brand which was recommended by a groomer. The new brand did not work at all. In fact, it made them look worse. I used it on two Maltese puppies with the same result on each. After starting Angel's Eyes again, I saw a difference immediately. My puppies are looking much better each day and the tear stains are almost gone (again). I'll never buy another brand.",dogs,3
I used to have one of these a few years back and my two older cats loved it. My new kitten took a little time to get used to it but now loves it. the older model had a flow valve and this one doesn't. The charcoal filter is also different and gets slimy (these are the two reasons why it didn't get 5 stars). Otherwise a great deal (much cheaper than in the stores).,cats,2

I didn't realize the batteries had died until someone brought my dogs to the front door. There is a low battery indicator but I hadn't looked in a while.

"I have two elderly dogs (both over the age of 13) that have joint and hip issues. In an effort to alleviate the stiffness, I turned to glucosamine. I tried several brands of tablets and none have met my dogs' approval. When I feed my dogs, these tabs sit at the bottom of their dish. If I have any hope of them being consumed, I have to use a pill cutter or knife to break them in halves and quarters and then I have to cover them with canned dog food. What's more, my dogs need more than 500 mg of glucosamine so doing this several times a day was a tad much. I've since started to useFor Animals-K-9 Level 5000 Glucosamine - 32 oz - Liquid. I place the liquid on top of their food and they don't appear to notice, or at least, have not engaged in any hunger strikes because of its presence.According to the Nutri Vet Hip and Joint Plus container, 1/2 chew is recommended per 40 lbs. of body weight. If you decide to follow the guidelines, prepare to get out the pill cutters. These tablets are a decent size but not easily snapped in half without the use of a supplemental cutting aide. Each tab has 500 mg of glucosamine, which is from a shellfish source. Two-hundred mg of chondroitin sulfate is also provided, which hails from a bovine source.This product has received good reviews and, to be fair, my dogs are older and have poor teeth. This might have played a role in their distaste for the product, which is a little denser than other glucosamine tabs on the market.According to the product labeling, this product may be used with pregnant dogs. This product should not be given to dogs with an allergy to shellfish.This product is made in the United States.",dogs,3
I use these to line the levels in my bunny's cage/condo. He tears them apart eventually (3-5 months) so then I just replace them. I secure them down with zip-ties. They are bunny safe and bunny approved!,bunny rabbit central,1
"Angels' Eyes worked almost immediately on my 6 year old cockapoo. Before using it, i would wipe his eyes everyday but they were still stained. Now, ALL the stain is gone and has not returned. This product is SO superior to other over-the-counter products you can buy at a retail pet store. Plus, he absolutely loves the taste!",dogs,3
"We bought the smaller version and opted to buy another...this larger one. Wow, it's big! Only have to fill this once a week, versus every day for the smaller one. It's surprisingly quiet, and the power cord is sturdy and protected. Pets love it, and the filters aren't very expensive and last awhile. Also provides a nice quiet white noise to break up the silent nights, if that may help you sleep.",dogs,3
"This product has been great for our weimeraner. He was eating Wellness, which he loved. But they kept jacking their prices up- so we had to switch. Our dog food retailer recommended Healthwise as a comparable solution. He has very sensitive skin. With Healthwise, he still doesn't itch and it has no corn or by products.",dogs,3

"The large FURminator is an absolute miracle for anyone with a German Shepherd (and a German Shepherd mix who inherited the undercoat). While I can't explain how it so gently removes the thick undercoat without pulling at the outer coat, I can say it's already saved me hours of grooming and it's done an exponentially more effetive job than I ever could with any of the other dozen or so tools I've tried. Although I'm probably going to have to come up with some other form of upper body workout to replace the long aerobic brushings I used to force upon my dogs, there are a lot fewer furballs rolling across the tile and both dogs come running when I pick it up so it's making everyone happy.",cats,2

"I got my folks a miniature schnauzer a couple of years ago, and gave her this toy hedgehog (which was then bigger than she was!). It was her very first toy, and she quickly pulled out almost all the fur. After some time, I found another, and she glommed onto that one just as quickly. She's got other toys she loves, but her hedgehogs are are absolute favorite go-to toy. I haven't been able to find one anywhere for a long time, so was thrilled to see one here!",dogs,3
"I picked up this crate for my 8 month old great dane. He is already 130 pounds and was outgrowing the next smaller crate. This crate is going to be large enough for my dog to grow into and will be big enough to last the rest of his life. Once you get through the directions the crate is very sturdy. If you have a large (Giant) dog, rest assured that your dog will be safe in this crate.",dogs,3
"After reading all the reviews, I ordered this for our dog with FCE, who is unable to get up on the couch with a pretty lame left rear leg. We tried several times, and she fell off once. we'll be sending it back.",cats,2
Great for a cat or a small dog like a chihuaha. Well thought out for a portable animal transport and fits under airplane seats perfectly.,dogs,3
"Had no appreciable effect on the local feral felines when two units were simultaneously placed at the entry points to my fenced yard. Cats didn't even twitch their ears when walking by and didn't seem at all discouraged from return visits. (And if you're near, the sound they make IS audible to humans - or at least to this one. (Didn't seem to dissuade a foul-tempered possum from entering the yard either.)",cats,2
"This rain cape is generously cut and well-made. My and I husband were amazed at the quality; it also has reflective stripes, which is a prectical idea!If your dog is at the border of two sizes, order the smaller one. (I found this out when I ordered a medium for my daschund mix and my Jack Russell. 'Fit the Jack Russell, but was much too big for the smaller dog.)We are very satisfied with the purchase.",dogs,3

"Like most other products on the market with moving parts, this fountain works well as long as a few simple steps are followed. I have three cats, all drink out of the fountain regularly. I've had this product for almost three years, and so far it has operated flawlessly. I refill the water reservoir daily - even if there is water left in the reservoir I empty it and refill it with fresh water. The entire unit gets taken apart and washed out probably once every 6 weeks to 2 months, and I replace the charcoal filter three or four times a year. The most important thing with this fountain is to keep it clean of fur - the loose fur tends to clump at the inlet of the submersible pump, starving it of water. Rather than taking the pump completely out every month to clean the hair out of it, I used an old pair of my wife's panty-hose to make a bunch of little pre-filters. I put put a small hole near the top of the piece of material, slide the hole over the speed control, and anchor the bottom in place with the removable housing. The home-made screen catches the pet hair and other debris before it enters the pump chamber, and I just scoop it away every couple of days with my fingers (sometimes I use the tines of a fork).",cats,2
"The feeder itself is pretty decent for the price. As for squirrels getting through it, well, you have to fight the squirrels on your own, that's not the feeder's fault. However, it has a wide gutter all around, where the birds perch to eat. The gutter catches all the seed hulls, chaff, and various garbage from teh feeder. The gutter turns to a near solid mass of gunk after the first rain. The drain holes are clogged or bloacked, and all the stuff in teh gutter just sits there wet & soggy, and quickly has 2 negative effects. First, once it builds up to the top of the gutter, it effectively stops the fresh seed from coming out of the dispensing holes. Second, you'll have a nice moldy smelly mess if you don't clean it out often. I am going to try drilling a few larger holes all around, but otherwise, unless you live in a dry climate, you might be better off with a feeder that has perches like wires or sticks for the birds, instead of this solid shelf.",birds,0
"I've been using this product for almost a year. My cat is very food obsessed. Before getting this, he would meow at me and bug me to feed him all of the time. Now, he just continues to paw at the magical giver of food close to meal times. Since the feeding times are consistent, he has a pretty good idea of when it will turn. Originally he pawed at it obsessively all day until he figured that out. He has never once managed to open it despite trying *very* hard. He can spin it backward to the empty compartments, but it never deprives him of his future meals when the time arrives. When it gets very close to meal time, he is often able to push it open to the next slot, but this is only possible about 15-30 minutes before the scheduled time.I would urge anyone who gets this to read the directions carefully and completely. When I first read them, it seemed complicated, but once you understand how it works, it's a breeze. I would also encourage people to use it for awhile in a supervised capacity before relying on it to work while you are away for an extended period. I use mine all of the time, so I have confidence that it is set correctly when I will be out late or am away over night. The battery life also seems very good. I usually change it before vacations for my own peace of mind, but it has never actually gone dead in regular use.This is a very useful product that ensures my cat gets consistent regular meals, despite the twists and turns of my daily life. It has been a dream separating me from the food in my cat's mind.",cats,2
"I love our two Golden Retrievers, but keeping up with the shedding is a never-ending battle. I purchased the large FURminator as well as the FURminator deShedding Shampoo. The FURminator did the best job of pulling out the undercoat I have ever seen as well as doing it with the least amount of effort I've ever used. Terrific invention. The FURminator deShedding Shampoo is unbelievable. It is a coconut base shampoo with plant proteins, herbal extracts, Vitamin E, Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids, aloe vera and plant extracts. From what I can tell, it seems to be formulated with all natural ingredients. The directions say to leave it on for 5-10 minutes before rinsing. I was not thrilled with the prospect of trying to keep shampoo-lathered dogs from shaking lather all over the bathroom while this stuff sat for that amount of time, but both of them did really well. First off, the shampoo smells incredible. The dogs even seemed to like it. Secondly, among the herbal extracts are Calendula, Chamomile and Kava which may explain why they were so calm during their 10 minute wait. Last, but not least, they both looked absolutely beautiful and smelled fantastic when I was finished.I highly recommend both of these products.",cats,2
"i bought this citronella anti-bark collar thinking it would be a perfect solution for ending my pomeranian's constant barking anytime somebody tries to leave or enter our house. the problem with this collar is that it kept spraying citronella no matter what until all this citronella was in every part of our house. we suffered allergy problems of all sorts because of this, from tearing to coughing. however the real question is",dogs,3
"Our German Shorthaired Pointer loved his Huck so much he wouldn't stop chewing--until we had to take it from him because he chewed a piece off. West Paw has a guarantee, though, so we'll be getting another one--which we'll use for fetch instead of as a chew toy. He has a Hurley, too, which he hasn't been able to chew pieces off of yet, so he gets to keep that one. U.S.-made of non-toxic materials--an added bonus. Great toys from a great manufacturer.",dogs,3

"We were doubtful at first when we saw this furminator. It looked the much same as our metal flea comb that the cats don't particularly care for but one that has given us reasonable results. However, I am happy to report that our cats line up to be ferminated. Even the youngest one, who has hated to be combed, is asking for more, more, more. We are certainly glad we bought this because it does what it claims - it digs down deep into the fur and brings up more hair than any other process we have ever tried. Even our little gray cat that sheds very little gave up gobs of hair when we used the furminator.",cats,2

This is my dog's third ball---and his favorite toy. I stuff large dog treats into the holes and he runs around and chews on it until he has all of them. It also helps keep the tartar off his teeth. Occasionally the ball gets away and rolls down the hill and then mysteriously shows up when neighbors find it and return it-and then ask where they can get one for their dog. I keep one in the house and one in the garage-it is the first thing he looks for every morning.,dogs,3

"These are called natural mice, but I'm not sure that my cat would agree. They are still not the ""natural fur"" mice that she really likes, although I thought they were from the description. She enjoys them much more than the mice made of cloth that I bought her before, which she tolerates but in which she has no continued interest. I thought a mouse is a mouse, but what do I know? If you want to know mice, ask a cat!Here is what I want:First I would like a description available on Amazon that would tell me the materials. I don't want cloth or catnip. The Petmate natural mice appear to be fur, and on the box they are called catnip toys. I'm not a big fan of the ""nip"" but these were the closet thing I could find on Amazon since most of the descriptions were lacking detail.Second I want a small natural fur mouse. The last I had were from Boots and Barkley at Target and they don't seem to have them any longer. My cat likes them quick and crunchy. The little, hard, natural fur mice are perfect for batting around the house, but they don't last too long. Maybe the ones that sell in bags of a dozen or more are the ones that the cat really wants. The Petmate soft bite toys are holding up much better than the cheaper ones, but it might just be lack of attention.",cats,2

"I recently purchased a 2nd pet tube because I liked the 1st one so much. I hadn't seen it advertised in the usual pet magazines any longer and liked it so much I decided to purchase the 2nd for a back up. I take 2 Westies on long trips and they travel extremely well in the tube. It's much nicer than using single crates and more comfortable than having to restrain the dogs in harnesses, especially for long trips. Having the tube in the back seat within the passener compartment seems like it would be safer for the dogs than in crates in the back of an SUV.There is a carrying case and the tube compresses into a very small space when folded up, however, I never use the case as I leave the tube in the back seat of the car all the time.The pet tube pillows are a total waste of money and probably not the safest. I can hear the dogs sliding on the hard nylon surface as I drive around a curve when the pillows are in the tube. I have removed the pillows and put Snoozies back in the tube.",dogs,3
It's a very good leash although it has the same circular about amputated fingers as the string leash! But I decided to keep this one b/c it's what I wanted and I just have to avoid grabbing the leash itself instead of setting the built-in &#34;brake&#34;.,dogs,3
"I know people have said that the weak point of this product is that the handle breaks easily, so we're being careful with that. In all other ways this product does exactly what we needed. Our border collie's very thick undercoat came out easily without discomfort for him. On the contrary, he behaves as if he is getting the best massage of his life. It's hilarious! He loves it. We also have long-furred cats for whom spring is usually a misery of shedding and hairballs. One tends to get bad tangles and matts in her fur. Let me tell you--all of them like this rake and it gets the undercoat quickly and easily so they will be cooler, more comfortable, and less prone to that horrible ACKACKACK I'm-gonna-stain-the-carpet announcement all long-fur-cat owners dread. I myself use a CPAP at night and the straps in back of my hair tend to give me tangles in my super-fine hair. I resorted to trying this on myself a couple of days ago. It's a bit embarrassing to admit but it took MY tangles right out without pulling or discomfort. Honestly, if I had to go through raising little girls again, I'd want one of these to get the tangles from their hair. The tears and conflict over hair brushing would be gone. It flat-out works and works quickly and I'd bet it would work on any kind of hair, including any human hair. They should make and market a version for little girls whose mothers do battle every morning on tangled hair and tender scalps.",dogs,3
"Dogs are omnivores, meaning they can survive on a vegetarian diet, but by no means will they thrive without the inclusion of animal proteins. If you are genuinely concerned about the moral implications of a dog's diet and choose to feed this to your dogs, I would STRONGLY suggest supplementing this food with free range eggs, sustainably harvested sardines, or some other source of animal protein that you deem morally acceptable.I have vegetarian friends who feed their dogs this and other formulas, and when compared to my lab, who is fed a high- protein, grain- free dog food, they almost look abused. Literally, they are all very slim and their fur is coarse and patchy, as opposed to my dog, who is muscular, with fur is as soft as cotton, and as happy as can be.If you want an all- inclusive dog food that will handle your dog's nutritional needs, this is not the dog food for you. That said, if your morals won't allow you to use a dog food with named meat products as the top ingredients (and there are organic varieties), then this may be a good option for you. Please, just remember to supplement with some form of animal protein every time you feed.",dogs,3

"I have owned this filter for 3 months now,installed on a 75 gallon fresh-water tank set up for discus. Water quality,and clarity is perfect,(I do regular partial water changes as recommended as well). I do use ""chemi-pure Elite"" instead of carbon, for chemical filtration. The filter itself does demand that you assemble it carefully. Flow is excellent. It is absolutely silent, had to pull up the tube to see if it was even running-it was shooting out ! I have had cannister filters clear back to the original Hills-Kordon 3 stage filter 20+ years ago. It was good but not big enough. This one is great. Not for a casual hobbyist really though. If you just want to hang a filter on the back, install some filter media and go-get an external power filter. I do see how if not assembled carefully, this could leak, or if a hose came off. However, this is a fairly serious piece of equipment and does what it is advertised to do. Discus are completely unforgiving, mine are healthy and happy, with this and multiple power head undergravel filtration to augment it. I am putting one on my ""altum"" wild angel tank next. I would not hesitate to use it on a marine tank either.",fish aquatic pets,4
Easy to clean and works good for food. Not so good with water. The dish is too shallow for my large pooch so he just makes a big wet mess. I use a big stainless steel bowl for his water now.

"This product seems to work well in the tank. During the summer my tank starts getting overrun my algae, I tried cleaning regularly, but could not keep up and the algae kept coming back. I tried the liquid algae killer, but it did not work either. I saw these at Walmart and tried these (they are a kind of high, so I thought they better work). After a water cycle I dropped one in the tank near the bubbler (figured it would disperse into the tank). It quickly dissolved. I came back the next day and found the tank to be clean. The algae was gone and the ornaments that I could not clean (algae in crevices and could not scrub out) were clean. I came to Amazon and bought some more, I want to point out that it is a box of tablets (individually wrapped like effervescent tablets) and not a bottle like pictured.I am not sure what these tables are, but they have crazy warnings! It states that if you just get this on your skin you should call poison control, so be careful and do not let kids deal with it. I hold the tablet packet on the end and snip off the top over a trash can, than just drop it into the tank, and throw the rest of the packaging away. I am very careful with these, I do not know what is in them that is so bad to humans, but the fact that is states that if you just come in contact (even skin) you should call poison control immediately...In the end these seem to work, I put one in each tank (my tanks are each 10 gallons ; one has tetras [black, neon, and red, this tank has salt added for disease prevention] and the other is split with two male bettas) after each water change and I have not had a problem with algae like I did before I got these. I still see some in areas of direct sunlight, but not as bad as before. I will keep using these and so far these are the only thing that works in my tanks.",fish aquatic pets,4

I researched Emu oil products and it makes your hair grow faster (eyelashes and eyebrows too!) plus stops it from falling out. If you have fine or permed hair i would not suggest this type shampoo as it doesn't add any body but if you need softness, shine,strength and overall "" hair everyone wants to pet"" buy this one!!

"Just put together 2 beds. They seem sturdy and look good but the dogs have not used them yet. This post is to add to the assembly instructions. Putting it together with two people will make it easier. Took us about 5 minutes per bed. (You certainly can put it together by yourself.) The instructions that came with my beds showed slightly different parts than came in the box. Mine had 2 side tubes (the long side) and 4 legs. The instructions show 2 types of sidebar/leg tubes that join in the middle. There was no comment in the instructions as to which side of the tube should be to the outside. While the bed will go together either way, if you put the flatter side (where the bolt goes) towards the fabric, the bolt will not extend past the side bar. As others have said, to get the final bolt in, put in 3 bolts and leave them loose. This will let you twist the frame, without bending any tubes, and easily put in the last bolt.",cats,2

"Before getting a HALTI, we described walking our dog as ""going for a drag"". We had to fight the whole time, tugging back the dog. Even with a choke style collar, the dog would pull while coughing and wheezing. When he wanted to stop to sniff a spot on the ground, he'd brace his body for the tug, and keep on sniffing. Not fun, and not the kind of exercise I had hoped for when walking the dog. Instead of a nice brisk walk, I had shoulder pain...About 5 years too late, we bought a Halti for our English Springer. At first, he bucked and tried to paw it off. That didn't take too long though. You'll quicky find that when the dog sees it, they'll lift their nose for you to put it on without any problem. It is wonderful! I've recommended it to others with both large and smaller breeds, and they've all had the same wonderful results. Make sure that the HALTI fits correctly. If you get one that is too big, and your dog lunges back suddenly, it will come off.Also, if you do stop to talk to a neighbor for too long, the dog may start to paw at the Halti or chew on it in an effort to get it off. Don't let the dog chew on it, it is fabric, and our dog did chew through one.",dogs,3

"This product satisfies about 95% of what I wanted it to. It accomplishes the purpose - keeping the dog from jumping into the backseat. However, the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you don't secure them. I also had a little trouble keeping the horizontal bar parts from slipping downward. Overall, this product was worth the $26 or so dollars I paid for it!",dogs,3
"My dog is an escape artist. She's a hound dog, so she's very slender and can slip out of ALL of the 15 or so harness styles we've purchased... except for this one. It is a life saver!When she tugs, as others have described, it flips her around to face you. So naturally, my escape artist puppy, when turned around to face me- starts backing up to slip the harness. As she does this, the band across her chest tightens, and she ends up just making herself very uncomfortable. Over a year and a half of terrible leash behaviors, and it only took her about 10 minutes in this new harness to realize that if she wanted to enjoy her walk, she'd have to be good.I am so ecstatic to have found this! Her ability to get off the leash was getting very dangerous, as she's difficult to catch. And at this price! Gosh. We have paid top dollar for a lot of the more expensive harnesses to have them just fail at what they boasted.I'll be purchasing the other colors, as now that I know it works, I dont mind paying more for the girly colors that match her leashes - and I'm sure we'll want to have plenty of spares.",dogs,3
"I purchased this food because it's a larger bag at a cheaper price compared to the California Naturals I usually buy. The only real drawback to this cat food is it contains more grains, I believe. And it would be preferable for it to just have whole grain brown rice over white. But it does have a variety of meat sources, which makes it unique.The bag I got had a bit of an unpleasant smell when I opened it. It smelled more like grocery store cat food than other high-end kibbles I've bought. The cats seem to like it fine, though not all of them were crazy about it. I think part of that is because this food is crunchier than what they had before. They are all used to it now, but I think they may prefer their other food. This is a pretty good deal, though, so I will probably alternate this with other brands.If you're looking for a higher-end, nutritious cat kibble at a pretty good price this definitely isn't a bad choice. How many cat foods have chicken, salmon, turkey, duck, flax, kelp, and herbs with no byproducts or low grade ingredients?",cats,2
"I have a 110 pound mutt who really is pretty smart. Most of the time. Unfortunately, once we go a on walk, he forgets that he is smart, and pulls like crazy. Of course, I'm sure I ultimately could have trained him not to pull, but after many tries, I got frustrated, he got frustrated, and we never got to enjoy our walks. The gentle leader works very well. He complained a little about it when we first got it, but I just had him wear it for a few minutes longer each day while giving him treats (he's very food motivated, except when it comes to not pulling my arm out of socket everytime he sees a bird when we are walking), so after about 4 days, he tolerated wearing it and our walks are delightful now.You do need to be careful how you use it. You can't jerk the leash at all, but you don't need to, really.I am a believer, and recommend the GL to anyone with a large dog who pulls.",dogs,3
"This product is awesome! I tried it out officially yesterday and it took my puppy a bit to get used to the idea, but then he loved it and really enjoyed it! If I can post a picture of him, I will, he's adorable and such a good dog. I would highly recommend this for people and their pets, because it has a great secure way to attach to a seatbelt as well as his harness to the seatbelt for added safety. I highly recommend this product! I'm so happy it went on sale and I got it! I also purchased the medium size, as to give him room to grow and that way I wouldn't have to upgrade, if I had gotten the small size. I also love that it's lightweight and fits just perfect in the front seat of my car (which is a small sedan). No more carrier crate for my dog!",dogs,3

"If the regular Chuckit is good, the Ultra Grip is great.Much like the regular Chuckit, you can throw the ball farther, faster and longer than you can with your arm, while also enjoying the benefit of a Saliva-free Dog run session.The main difference between the Ultra Grip and the regular Chuckit is the soft, synthetic grip that coats the inside of the Chuckit, providing a far more comfortable throwing experience.Additionally, it is quite durable, handling cold temperatures and thousands of repetitions without fail.",dogs,3
"My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing. I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide. The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes. The description calls these ""edible chews,"" so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied. I wouldn't call these bones ""chewy"" either. They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry. I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember. I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).",dogs,3
"It arrives big and overstuffed, but the dogs had it squashed down in short order. They loved it. One thing to note, which is quite nice- the rim edge of the top cover top has some sort of plastic or metal rod, that keeps the top of the ""cave"" open. We own a different brand of ""tee-pee,"" and the dogs must burrow and dig to get into the bed itself. The top falls down around the bed like a blanket or such. This one does not, which they seem to like. It is different. If you spoil your dogs, this is a nifty item.",cats,2

"I happen to own a dog who is very prone to allergy problems. He cannot tolerate most additives, but I was able to add Linatone Plus to his diet without a problem.

"We recently got a maltese/yorkie mix puppy, who chews EVERYTHING. He also bites and chases feet, which has become a major issue and is PAINFUL! Bought this stuff hoping the feet chasing would end- sprayed my shoes and bottoms of pants. He immediately sniffed the air and kind of backed away, however, after this stuff dried (which was in seconds), he continued to bite my feet/chase my pant legs. So in short, for me it worked when wet, but once this stuff dries, nothing. The search for a method to end my puppy's biting continues!",dogs,3
I would expect it would be as the name implies. I have 2 new ones. One of them powers 2 sponge filters in a 29gal and the other powers a bubble wand in the 75gal.

"What a great grooming tool! I bought it because I have three long-haired cats and always seem to be vacumming up hair. The Shed Ender got down to the undercoat, just like it claimed. I was absolutely amazed at how much fur I pulled out of their coats! I had brushed them with a regular brush before I started, and gotten very little hair off. The Shed Ender removed piles and piles of hair - in fact, the pile of hair was almost as big as my cat! It took a little practice to get the hang of how to use it, but I was very impressed with the results. It takes some time to go through the animal's whole coat, but it's toally worth it!Other reviewers said they liked the Furminator better, but it costs quite a bit more. I went to a local pet store to check out the prices of the Furminator, and the least expensive one (the smallest) was $34.95 (versus the same size Shed Ender at $9.99!). I say, try the Shed Ender first - you'll love it!",dogs,3

"My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages. My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us! Seriously, you will be impressed with the ingredients list on these foods.",cats,2

"I have a cat that loves to urinate on my favorite lazy-boy chair. I read some bad reviews of this product before buying, I just wasn't smart enough to pay attention to them. I felt sure this would do the trick. It just sounded like such a wonderful idea, and believed it would work. But unfortunately, it just doesn't. After putting this on the chair, I admit I didn't sit and watch for hours or anything, but I used it faithfully for about a week. I saw my cat jump up a few times, and the alarm didn't even go off. Perhaps it did, when I wasn't around, but it must not have scared her. It's not very loud, or scary sounding. She continued to pee on the chair, right beside the Tattle Tale device. I continue to wonder if this product might have potential, if they improve on the idea by making it much louder, and much more sensitive to movement. But as it is, this is a total, and complete waste of money. Don't order it. I ended up buying a Scat-Mat, which cost a bundle, but was well worth every penny. But if you buy a Scat-Mat, just try to remember not to sit on it yourself! It hurts!",dogs,3

It kept the baby's attention much longer than most of her other toys, and she loved trying to pull out the ball and scratch at the cardboard (I think she was fascinated by the texture). The cat plays with it in pretty much the same way, except she also likes to lay on it for long periods of time as well as bite it. Definitely worth the $17 we paid for it and we honestly would have paid even more if we had to. It's that good of a toy.

"I bought this fountain last summer and it worked very well. The filter that arrived with the fountain lasted 4 weeks and worked wonderfully. When I replaced the filter, I noticed that there was black residue at the bottom of the reservoir. The new filter was bleeding into the water. So I called the company and the young lady who answered was very nice and recommended I rinse the filter in cold water before using it (she also sent me a pack of replacement filters gratis, she didn't have to do this). I replaced the water and tried another filter after rinsing it and again it bled into the water. I then used the fountain without a filter and it worked fine this way for a while but I noticed the mildew occurred a lot faster than with the filter.Also, After several months of use the motor began to stick and was very difficult to remove during disassembly. Basically, I have mixed feelings about this fountain. It works well, but that filter has some issues. I've stopped using the fountain for everyday, its just too much trouble.",dogs,3
"I bought 2 36"" crates for my 50 lb dogs. They were shipped in the original boxes, which were beat up a little during delivery, but the crates were not damaged at all. It took me less than 5 minutes to set up the crates. It was a bit like a puzzle, but not difficult to do. Just to give you a little background, I'm a 5'1"" 118lb female and yes, the crates are heavy, but that's the point. HEAVY duty wires will be heavy. It was awkward moving them when they were set up but hey, the crates are larger than I am and it was easy enough for me to do! Folded up, I can certainly carry them and put them in the trunk by myself (not to be mean, but maybe some people should lift some weights). I like that both of them fit easily into the trunk of our Altima. I am thinking of taking the two side doors off and sandwiching the two crates together. My dogs like to sleep together and they can go back and forth if they want some space. I actually wanted to get one large crate for both of them, but it wouldn't fit into the trunk and my husband wanted the dogs to have more room.PROS",dogs,3
"I have been using this pet feeder everyday for about a month and it has done a very good job. It has consistently fed pre-measured meals at the appropriate times and is completely silent unless it is dispensing food. I had previously purchased another automatic feeder that sounded like a kitchen timer whenever it was in use and it drove me crazy. The instructions that accompany this feeder are not very intuitive and it was fairly difficult to program until I found another reviewers ""cheat sheet"" on here. I printed that out and filed it away because there is no way I would remember all of the steps. My only other problem with it is that I wish it could feed in increments smaller than 1/4 of a cup. I realize most people don't need that small of a measurement, but it would have been nice for me because my cat is on a fairly strict renal diet.",cats,2

"These collars are great. I have used one for my 38 pound Boston Terrier. They almost immediately correct leash pulling, and can be used as a quick and effective &#34;no&#34; with a tiny tug. They're not cruel, though people who don't know them may assume they are. The one I use for my Boston is a bit beefier than the one I just purchased here for my Chiweenie (Chihuahua - Dachshund mix).The Guardian Gear 14 Inch dog collar is a great value for the price. The rubbery nibs for the prongs are a little annoying, but they seem to stay on. However, if you don't put on/take off the collar by sliding over the dog's head, you have to remove two of the rubber nibs as you slide the prongs off the adjacent link. The more substantial collar that I have doesn't seem to need the nibs neither to keep the collar together nor to cushion the prongs. However, this other collar cost about $30 more.Other than that, the collar works great. It may take a moment to get used to this type of collar if you are new to them, but they are an invaluable training tool and can save relationships between overzealous dogs and frustrated owners. Or they can just teach your dog to loose-leash walk.I am very pleased with the collar; the quality is good, and the value is exceptional.",dogs,3

Without the ball, he eats in under a minute. This way he pushes the ball with his nose or feet, up onto the throw rugs to get more kibbles out, and it has withstood his biting.

They moved out and a new dog moved next door and ignores the device completely. This dog has a very high pitched bark that borders on a squeak and I don't think the microphone picks up the frequency, that or this dog doesn't mind the noise. I even put both devices in the same yard and there is no difference in this dog's barking.

"I wish I had a video to post of my two little dogs being scatted off this mat, but I've never actually seen them get on the mats. We bought a new furniture set for the outdoor patio to replace a futon couch that our min pin and fox terrier/pom loved to nap on (and thus rendered un-guest-friendly), and we were determined to keep them off the new couch. We placed two of these, end-to-end, on the couch, but only after testing it on ourselves at the lowest setting. The &#34;shock&#34; is more surprising than it is actually painful, so we had no qualms about using it for the dogs after the people test. And though we haven't seen our boys get shocked by the mats, they must have at some point, because they do not go on the couch whatsoever. In fact, we noticed that they were so averse to even glancing at the couch, we haven't bothered to turn on the mats for about a month now, and they still avoid the couch like the plague. That's the best part, since we no longer need to keep batteries in the mat and don't get shocked ourselves when we forget the mat it still on.",dogs,3

He has an undercoat and fur that gets long, about 2-3 inches, that gets matted so easily, and its a wonderful transport for outside grass into my home. I bought this brush along with another brush to try out and this one has by far been the most useful. I will pick a section of his fur and start gently brushing at it little by little and the fine teeth start to undo the mats and pull out any lingering grass... You can't press on it too hard or it will easily get to his skin so you have to be careful about that, those teeth are sharp! My dog is such an attention err..hog and he loves his brushings. When he has no mats, this just slide through his fur and he loves it. I imagine it feels like light scratching. I pull out tons of fur but it comes off the brush easily enough.",cats,2

"Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20. Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction. One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day. I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans. The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each. But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it. Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.",cats,2

"First off, this thing is huge. A normal person will easily fit through the opening. I knew this of course, but I needed enough space for a 150 lb dog to fit. Overall, install is pretty easy. The hardest part for me was to get the screws through. If you don't drill the holes perfectly level, you'll have a hard time lining up the two sides of the dog door. There's a piece that goes outside and one inside and they bolt together. I know people complained about the plastic bolt, but if you're not perfectly lined up, the plastic bolts will allow some movement. I found them to be plenty sturdy, and I'm not worried about someone forcing them off. As stated earlier, the person could easily just come through the dog door itself. The way I look at it, do you really want to sneak into a house with a dog big enough to require a door this big???The only negative that I see, hence the 4 stars, is that with very little wind, the sides of the flap bellow, letting air in. The bottom has a magnetic strip so it stays put, but there is enough flexibility in the flap for it to bulge out and let air through. Other than that, it's great.",cats,2

"I have four cats - two 2-year olds and two 3-year olds. They have tons of toys, and each cat has his or her preference as to which types of toys they prefer (one likes crinkle toys, one likes to play with plastic caps from water bottles, one likes to chase balls) but this carrot is now the new favorite toy of ALL of them!They can get pretty aggressive with their toys, and we've gone through many that weren't as durable as they should have been. I was sure that the feathers on this carrot wouldn't last long, but surprisingly, after a few weeks now, they're still holding on strong! Also... we have a stray cat that hangs around our home, and he's usually too skittish to play, but I tossed him this carrot and he went at it right away... he loved it! I would DEFINITELY recommend this cat toy!",cats,2
"We ordered the 40"" Bagel Donut bed (black sherpa). Here is my feedback.Overall",dogs,3
I was encouraged to buy Nupro Joint Support and Glucosamine for my dogs when I recently adopted a dog from a high kill shelter. My other dog is 12 years old. I figured it couldn't hurt. They like the taste because when you add a little warm water it makes a thin gravy. I am hoping the more I use this product I will see a difference in my older dog. He has arthritis I have noticed he is starting to jump back up on the bed....,dogs,3
"My dog loves this toy. The squeeking noise gets him going but he is more interested in destroying the house that the toy squirrels reside in than the squirrels themselves! It's not indestructible, though, that's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. I have a dachshund and I will have to watch him carefully when I get the toy out for him to play with because he will tear it to shreds! I have already heard one rip. But, dachshunds are notorious for destroying toys, I just was hoping this one was tougher. :)",dogs,3
"This tool does an excellent job on our 80-pound yellow lab. He sheds constantly, and this tool seems to cut down on the amount of hair that accumulates around the house.I have discovered, however, that the tool only works on dogs with that kind of bristle-like coat. We have two beagles, for example, one of whom has a much smoother (and more correct) coat than the other. The Furminator does almost nothing on the one with the correct coat. The other beagle, who has a field beagle heritage, has a more bristle-like coat, and the Furminator does pick up a fair amount from her.The medium-size tool seems right for a dog the size of our lab. It doesn't take very long to go over him with that size of tool. I think the large size would be too big, and make it difficult to engage the full width of the blade on the contours of his body. Thus, the medium turned out to be a good choice.All in all, a good tool as long as the dog has the right kind of coat for it.",cats,2
"This elevated pet feeder w/storage is perfect for my German Shepherd puppy. I thought about getting the smaller one, but figured I might as well spend the extra money to get her something she could grow into, and I'm glad I did!The box arrived pretty trashed and beat up. I don't know if that is what the ""free shipping"" entailed; however, it was also still in its Castelmere packaging, which definitely saved it from the UPS guy(s). Needless to say there were still minor bumps and scratches on it. Assembly was super easy and the bowls are really nice, too. Beatrix Kiddo loves her new feeding station and I definitely plan on getting one for my older German Shepherd Dog. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a stylish, yet inexpensive, feeder/storage box for their dog(s).",cats,2
"I could not believe this item existed. I thought it was a life saver as both of my dogs fear nail clipping, actually I fear it more than they do as I have cut a quick in the past and felt guilty for years. Followed the simple instructions, but the green light would turn green too early, any common sense person would know that this would be wrong, but what about if it was someone's first dog and did not know better about the quick, they would cut the nail too short and hurt the dog. The light would turn red where there was no quick.in brief",cats,2
"My fur child, Adobe, is a very finicky eater; will eat nothing but one brand of cat food and ""people tuna."" Lax'Aire has been a lifesaver for his digestive system, but on our travels we have occasionally landed in a place where the local vets and pet stores do not carry Lax'Aire. Adobe will not accept other brands. I think it is the addition of cod liver oil that appeals to him - it must have a fishy taste - and he LOVES it. Lax'Aire helps him expel the hair in his digestive tract and eliminates the throwing up that otherwise occurs. I am so happy to be able to buy it online at a reasonable price.",cats,2

"I purchased this item to fence in a six-month old puppy who weighs about forty pounds and is a calm-mannered sweetheart. I read reviews before purchasing, and while one stood out as alarming (the dog who was strangled in the gap at the door) the rest seemed fairly positive, and I knew I could adjust the height of the door to prevent it from being lifted up enough to squeeze a head into.I've worked construction before, and wasn't impressed with the quality of the chain link, which was already in a state of unraveling and had to be rewoven in places. I was even less confident in the metal ties provided to secure the chain link to the frame, and so after attaching them all at the recommended intervals (every five diamonds on the bottom) went through with security grade zip ties and secured in between all of those as well.Best estimates put it at fifteen minutes after I left, my dog escaped. The horrible quality chain link was a cinch for her to unravel and create a hole almost large enough to slip through unharmed. I say almost, even though she did slip through, because she sliced open a large gash about five millimeters from her eye. Fortunately, our backyard is fenced in, so she just hung out there all day until my wife got home, and is now recuperating with some neosporin.I want to send this back for a refund, but I'll need to wait until this weekend to disassemble it completely, and then since it weighs 165 pounds and is a giant awkward mess, it's going to be an enormous hassle to return. I'm extremely disappointed in this product. The other option would be to line the entire inside with chicken wire and cinder blocks, which is going to add a considerable additional expense to this already overpriced piece of junk.",dogs,3

"My 20lb (at the time) terrier mix had to curl up VERY tightly to uncomfortably fit in it. He filled it up completely, but the website we ordered from (not amazon) charged a high restocking price so we gave it to my brother for his 15lb dog. She fits perfectly. She isn't able to stretch out and still has to curl up but for shorter car rides it works just fine. She definitely enjoys seeing everything go by from the window. Now at 25lbs, my own dog still likes to jump in it when he gets a chance. Having said that, the sides are not too sturdy if your dog leans on them and can tip the seat or fall out. It is also difficult to clean. Somehow, fur gets under the cover and since the seat is made of foam, it attracts fur and is hard to remove. The cover is also hard to get back on and after about one year of regular use (maybe once every two weeks), it has really worn down. It would be a good idea to use a blanket or some additional cover on top of the original cover. It is still a good car seat and the foam has held up pretty well. It really is overpriced, being that it is just a large piece of foam with a small drawer and cover on it; however, if the sides were sturdier and the seat were easier to clean I could give this 5 stars because the dogs do seem to enjoy it.",dogs,3
"Having gone through many filters to sustain a 25 and 55 gallon tank, this has been the best filter I have tried as far as aesthetics and noise. Most filters I have tried produce a terrible vibration or rattle despite ad hoc washers used between the tank and filter to diffuse some of the vibration. In addition, from a fish's perspective, the vibration can be disturbing, unsettling, constantly evoking as stressful state and condition. This filter is silent mechanically with no vibration or rattling. However, the water flow is louder which I do not mind; it creates a tranquil trickling water-sound that can be heard and monitored around the house. If you are looking for a completely silent filter and are lazy about tank maintenance, this may not be the filter for you unless you enjoy the falling sound of water. However, if you are looking for a silent filter and are meticulous about tank maintenance, this filter would be ideal. It is low profile, the bio-wheel is a great, practical feature, and by maintaining a high water level, this filter will be soundless and sufficient. Another feature I did not realize until use, was there are two filter slots in each unit. Having purchased two 20-30 gallon filters to use on each side of the tank, this allows for 4 total filters to be used at once plus the additional bio-wheel on each filter.The size of unit is smaller than I anticipated as well. Considering I am pushing 300 Gph with two of these in a 55 gallon tank, I will opt to further purchase two of the 50 gallon filters with a push of 200 Gph for a total push of 400 Gph while requiring no additional room; the sizes are relatively similar. This will be optimal for my tank set-up, waste filtration, and fish health. Anything to be a little lazier in tank maintenance; environment disruption should be created only when absolutely necessary. An ideal tank will be self-sustaining requiring minimal owner conditioning and maintenance once acclimated and properly configured.",fish aquatic pets,4

"When the platypus arrived, none of us fully understood it. I didn't get why a dog would enjoy removing squeaky toys from a stuffed cavity. This was her first plush toy and I imagined her shredding the platypus and possibly eating the eggs. For about a month, my dog didn't remove any eggs, but she loved the platypus and gently carried it around, squeaking its belly. Then, after about a three-week incubation period, the platypus patient received a slight C-section and my dog extracted the eggs.She still loves her platypus. She loves digging the eggs out and carying them proudly around the house. This dog is not a strong chewer and the platypus and her offspring have held up pretty well over the months, with mild wear, like the aforementioned C-section and some tears to the eggs. The eggs are also fun to put in other toys like her hollow rubber lattice ball. Dogs just like pulling stuff out of stuff, apparently. We recently got the Hide-a-Squirrel and she loves that, too.Great toy!",dogs,3

I tried one of the new ones...no good. It was much harder to clean and fill. This one is just lift the top and add water, or just pour it directly into the bowl. I clean mine once per week and that seems just fine, it would depend on how dusty your home is and how furry your cat is. I also like the sound of the lightly bubbling water.",cats,2

"At least I have tried for 15 weeks. We have two 8 month-old kitties. I had thought as long as they were still kittens, it would be easy to toilet train them, but I was wrong. The major reasons appeared to be as follows:1. One cat was dominant over the other, and whenever the other one was trying to use CitiKitty, the dominant one disturbed him, such as holding his back legs to get him off of the CitiKitty. (Territorial issue)2. Our cats spend several hours a day in our backyard (w/harness), and are not completely indoor cats. They definitely preferred going potty outdoor to indoor as long as they can find some dirt there.Actually, the dominant one almost mastered CitiKitty, but because of the recessive one, who had to poop on the floor all the time, the dominant one also started to poop on the floor, seemingly so that he could territorialize the whole bathroom. By the time, the recessive one got totally scared of the dominant one, and without my help, he wouldn't go potty anymore. That's pretty much when I began to doubt about the whole process.I put a litter box back in the bathroom now, but I also kept the CitiKitty on the toilet seat hoping that at least one cat would keep using it. I was wrong again. Both cats now jumped back in the litter box, seemingly very happy not having to use CitiKitty anymore. I wonder if they realize that they don't get any more treats for not using CitiKitty.",cats,2

"These are apparently a slightly updated version of some Solvit steps that I've had for at least five years at the foot of my bed. I ""promoted"" that set to use with my new compact SUV that replaced a station wagon with a much lower step-up. That meant I needed something new for the foot of the bed. Since they're identical for all practical purposes, these work perfectly.These are for larger dogs but I can see where small dogs in good health could use them with no problem. They are about the same height as regular human stairs, so if your pet is too small or too infirm to use steps of that size, these are probably not for you. If your dog can use stairs in your house and weighs less than 250#, these will work.I noticed that my two dogs were reluctant to use the old steps to get in the new car, even though they were perfectly happy using them to get on the bed. I think it's because anything at all new to a dog is all-new, so my exhortations of ""oh come on Buford, they're the same steps!!"" didn't work. Expect to spend some time training and acclimating your pet(s) whether you're trying to get them in a bed, porch, car, couch, camper, whatever.These are very durable, sturdy and stable...you'd have to try hard to damage them. Mine arrived after an Amazon-advised ""unexpected delay beyond our control"" via UPS in a box that had been punctured on two sides, crushed at the top and taped back together. The steps were perfect. They come completely assembled and ready for use. Another reviewer thought that was a bad thing and I am still scratching my head over that.One minor complaint",dogs,3

"This bed is probably best for breeds 75 lbs or less. I have a 110-115lb greater swiss mountain dog. She has been laying on this bed for 2 weeks now (some during the day and sleeps on it at night). First of all the bed fabric is already stretched enough that she sinks down in the bed. I am hoping it does not stretch too much more but for only 2 weeks I am afraid this fabric will not last more than 3 months. Luckily the fabric can be replaced and is not expensive so I guess it is not so bad. The other problem is the one side keeps coming loose. The side and two legs are attached to the cross bars by a single screw (2 screws total for each side). The two screws on the one side of the bed keep coming loose. In the two weeks she has been using the bed I have had to tighten them two times. Luckily I know when they need to be tightened because all the sudden she will stop using the bed. I guess she can feel that it is not right. I believe the fabric and the frame is just not made for a dog this heavy. I will say that my dog is very gentle with the bed. She is a bit of a scaredy cat and very gingerly gets on and off it. It actually took some time to get her to stay on the bed because she was afraid of it at first. When she would get off the bed it would tip a bit and it made her really nervous. So, if you have a extra large dog that is not as gentle I cannot imagine it would last very long without having to be tightened and the fabric replaced. The last thing is my dog does not like the fabric. It is rough and until I put a blanket on it she would not touch it.In all I think the bed design is good if you have a lighter dog. The fabric is a bit rough but I would rather have rough fabric that can be easily cleaned. It is not a big deal to throw a blanket, crate bed or towel on top of it. I like having the bed raised up so much better then the dog beds laying on the ground. I find it so much easier to clean.",cats,2

"At 25 pounds, Wandrdog falls on the cusp between small and medium sized dogs. I prefer to describe her as a large small dog. She wears a 15 "" collar and many collars either go up to 14"" or start at 16"" and are either too tight or too large.Most of the time, I have to take her shopping to find the correct fit. Pet stores within dog walking distance of me don't carry the full variety of sizes and styles and colors to satisfy both dog and dog owner. We are both quite discriminating. When it came time to replace Wandrdog's old martingale collar and well-gnawed and patched leash, I spotted a chic black and metallic silver, woven nylon leopard pattern leash by Lupine but alas, there were no coordinating collars in the local store.Luckily, Lupine offers a good selection directly from Amazon and with some searching, I was able to locate a martingale collar and matching leashLupine 3/4-Inch Wild Thing 6 -Foot Leadin ""Wild Thing"", the pattern I wanted. This ""combo collar"" works both as a martingale and a standard collar. It fits over the heard as does a standard martingale but instead of round or D-shaped rings, the smaller martingale loop passes through narrow, squared rings. The leash can either be attached to a D ring on the small loop for use as a martingale, or to a D ring on the large loop when used as a standard collar. I don't plan to use this as a standard collar but as a martingale, it works extremely well. I purchased the ""w; 14-20"" neck size and it was easily adjustable to a perfect fit for Wandrdog's 15 "" neck.The collar is extremely well made from tightly woven, jacquard nylon webbing. Unlike other manufacturers, Lupine's designs are woven into the webbing and never printed or sewn on top. The rings are made of welded metal and are strong and secure as is the plastic buckle that adjusts the size. Lupine manufactures its products in Conway, New Hampshire and offers a life time guarantee.....even if chewed.Wandrdog is so pleased with her new collar and leash that she promises that she will never, never chew them!

"StarMark Every Flavor Treats / B0009YF43UMy puppy is in treat training, so we have plenty of different treats on hand. I slice them thinly for training, so that he doesn't get too satiated in training and so that his weight won't become unhealthy. I really didn't need any new treats for training, and certainly not these treats that work out to almost a dollar an ounce! But we recently bought the Everlasting Fun Treat Ball and found out, after it arrived, that our regular treats would not fit in the new ball. These treats were recommended for filling the ball. I hate to throw good money after bad, but I thought maybe these would be a fun enough diversion that it would be a worthwhile treat for the puppy, so I went ahead and bought some.The good news is that these treats do fit in the Everlasting Fun ball - almost as if the ball were made with these treats in mind! The treats slide in between the ""teeth"" of the ball opening easily, and the teeth don't catch at the treat (and my fingers) as they had in previous attempts to fill the ball. The treats are also very pretty, the different colors and flavors are neat for us humans to look at. The bad news is that the colors and flavors seem lost on my puppy, who much prefers his Omega ball, with its puppy kibble and occasional freeze-dried liver piece. He'll play with the Everlasting Fun treat ball and these treats if I give it directly to him, but when left to his own devices, he'll go back to his liver-laced kibble. I was expecting these treats to be exciting enough to hold his interest, but he seems kind of bored with them, and he seems to eat the treats more because they are there and less because they entice him - definitely not like the four or five other types of treats we use.This 5 oz. bag will fill our Everlasting Fun ball at least twice and maybe three times, but the ball is small enough that this isn't terribly impressive. Since he doesn't seem terribly interested in the treats, I'm thinking about slicing them up and adding them to his food, just to keep them from going to waste.~ Ana Mardoll",dogs,3

"My lab puppy has shredded everything I've left in her crate -- blankets, pillows, towels, cushions, etc. But for some reason, she's never attacked this bed -- just curls up and zonks out. I've always had to lure her into her crate with treats, but with this new dog bed, she actually goes in there on her own. Fantastic purchase.",dogs,3
"Can't recommend this box highly enough. I used to have a major litter kicker and tried all the fancy purple domed booda boxes without success. I recently got one cat and 3 foster kittens. The new cat came with this box which he used and the kittens took to it immediately. They much preferred it to the open boxes they had been using. They feel safer hidden inside.There is very little litter tracked out, no kicking, or anything slopping over the sides because there are no sides. I think it smells less too.I have a litter box-obsessed dog and it's not dog-proof. He's a clever, motivated retriever. I would think it would be safe with smaller dogs. I've tried putting clips on the sides but that hasn't worked so far.I thought of just making my own by buying a rubber maid type container and cutting a hole in it but you need a really solid lid, not a flexible one like most of the storage containers come with. Otherwise the cat can't jump up on it without feeling unstable and might get frightened.I ended up buying 4 of these for the 4 cats. They are pricy but I have about 5 other litter boxes which I've had for up to 20 years, left from my previous cat. You spread $32 dollars over 20 years and it's nothing.I bought mine at Petsmart for less than they are listing here.",cats,2
This product arrived so fast. Fits my dog perfectly. I love the Gentle Leader!! It's made walking a 90 pound dog such a breeze. Definitely recommend the product and the seller!!!,dogs,3
I have five cats but made a mistake...I only ordered one of these for them for Christmas! One of my cats has claimed this as her own so looks like I'll be buying four more. She plays until she literally starts panting! It's the best toy I've ever bought them and there have been quite a few toys it has beaten.I have found it very helpful to store the toy in the box it came in as then the cats can chew on neither the feathers or the pole when we aren't playing with it.,cats,2

"I bought this item for my english mastiff when we had a flea nest in our yard this summer. The fleas were not only on him but also in his bedding and in my house because of him. Within a few days of using our first treatment, his fleas were gone and even with him going outside daily, we did not have any additional problems for the rest of the summer when I used this as directed.It was well worth any price and the product delivered as promised.",dogs,3
When I bought this product I was beyond skeptical. I didn't believe it. However it does work and it works like they say. Odor is decreased in both waste and general. Yeah it works. But what's the price on health.I was leery about continued use due to the fact that I could not find enough research of alleviate my concerns about health. Then my little ferrets seemed to start having intestinal problems. They all seemed to have problems with cramping and stomach pain. I stopped use when my littlest started having problems walking with the arch to her back. Almost immediately the smell came back and the pain went away. I don't want to think about what else this stuff can to a ferret. I wouldn't use it and I don't.,bunny rabbit central,1
"I've used Litter Maid for almost seven years and finally got fed up with their inadequacy. I took a gamble and purchased Omega Paw, largely because of the good reviews and the price. I love it! I have two cats and one is always thirsty and leaves quite the mess in the litter box. The large size accommodates them both and I only have to change it twice a week. I gave it four stars because of two reasons:1. You probably need about a foot or so of space on each side of the box for the tilting, but other than that there's minimal maintenance; and2. The hooks to attach the lid can be somewhat cumbersome to attach.That said, I'd purchase it again.",cats,2
I have a Blue/White one but it's the same model. I Love how it has a Styptic powder included cuz we all cut it a wee bit too short sometimes. But I've used the guillotine type cutters and they never cut cleanly. But this one cut cleanly and my dogs didn't even flinch. I think I'm gonna be using this one for a LONG time. At I bought mine at Target for like $9.99 so the price and quality is excellent. I'd recommend it !!,dogs,3
"I can't say enough good things about this product. I adopted a 3 month old kittie from a rescue group 3 years ago. They had been treating him for an upper respiratory infection according to the group. Within a week he was at the vet with a raging case of feline herpes. It didn't take him long to infect the other 2 cats. My vet recommended Viralys. At $31.00 for the small container, it was a little pricey but they're worth it. Thank God for Amazon! The price for the 600 gram container is barely twice that of the small size from the vet. I have been using it on all the cats morning and night with no more episodes of herpes or any other illness. I add it to their morning/night wet food and they snarf it right up. It does smell pretty bad but they don't seem to mind. This stuff is truly awesome.",cats,2

"I bought this product to make my kitten eat slower. The product does just that. It also seems to entertain him and makes him work for his food. The ability to adjust the number of openings and the size really helps. (I use it with wellness core food.)

"I haven't had any issues of malfunction with my watering system. It's easy to assemble and set up. I clean it about once a week. It's not loud, in fact the bubbling is kind of pleasant. I know one of my cats enjoys watching it, and I ASSUME they are drinking from it because the water level goes down after awhile, but I have not actually SEEN them drink from it, and I'm not sure if it encourages hydration as I hoped it would.",cats,2
"It worked very well, he ties to bark and then stops right away. He'll stat as soon as I take it off for the night though because he's excited to get his bark back, but it'll be super helpful when I have my baby in a month for nap times.",dogs,3
"I bought this after my vet told us that our 9 week old kitten had roundworms. He tried to sell us a prescription wormer for $26 with only 2 doses but I knew there were better cheaper alternatives out there. I first tried an over the counter medication with piperazine but that was a disaster. It obviously tasted horrible and our kitten would not eat anything with the medicine. Next I tried wiping it on his legs so he would lick it off but that was equally disasterous. He kept flicking his paws trying to get rid of the medication and refused to lick anywhere near the foul tasting areas. He must've gotten some in him though because he vomited a few hours later. I did some more research on the web and found Nemex 2 was supposed to be safe and effective in dogs and puppies and was often used off label for kittens, cats and many other animals. I decided to give it a shot. I waited a few days to be sure the previous medication was out of my kitty's system and then mixed this with a little milk. He drank down every drop of the medicine and the next day I found evidence it had worked. Excellent product and it didn't seem to make him ill like the piperazine.",dogs,3
"I bought two of these carriers, size small, and they are perfect for a large cat. I love the peacock blue color and it is pretty darn close to what is pictured - a rich blue - very nice! I put rubber feet on one carrier so they can be stacked and not slide apart.The only complaint I have about this carrier is that there is no rear vent as stated in the description; maybe there is a rear vent in the larger sizes? It didn't matter for my particular use, but a more accurate description is definitely needed for those to whom it does matter.",cats,2

"This product is good if you want to go away and leave the cat for a week or a few days without spending money on a cat sitter. You can leave this with clean scoopable litter, ample water and food and feel confident the cat's basic needs are being met. If you have more than one cat, don't count on leaving this for a week without attention, you'll have to empty the bin every couple of days. The waste will pile up in the bin and it will not work anymore. Cleaning it is a bit of a problem but it can be done, just be careful not to get electrical parts wet. If you hate coming home from work to smelly litter boxes, this solves that problem.",cats,2

"I give these to my shar-pei instead of rawhide and he enjoys them a lot. They are dehydrated cow tails, so there are little crunchy bones inside of them. If your dog tends to gobble up things quickly or if you have a smaller type dog, I would probably opt for something else. I have had no problems giving them to my dogs (I also have a Doberman) who chew them slowly though. I like these because they do not contain four, corn, or other junk typical dog treats have.",dogs,3
"I have two American Bulldogs (60bs & 75lbs) that I place in this pen from time to time. The dogs can easily move the pen and can also change it's shape causing it to collapse and fall over. I went to the local hypen-mart and bought several 4-inch, dual-sided leash snaps to place in between the panels midway up on the pen. The leash snaps easily clip to the panels to prevent two panels from folding in towards one another. You'll need several 4-inch snaps to maintain the pens shape. 3-inch snaps are a little small and still allow the pen to change shape. I recommend doing this if your dogs jump up or are willing to push things with their noses. All in all, the pen works well, should hold up for years of use and is great for taking camping.",dogs,3

"The Kong Jump 'N Jack is a great product for the pet who likes to chase things. When tossed, it will bounce around irregularly, which engages your dog in a wonderful game of ""is it alive?""

"I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. It also doesn't have any breath freshening ingredients. I think the only reason why they are ""dental"" treats is because they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. These are MUCH better than the pounce soft and chewy varieties or any soft and chewy treat that can stick to cat teeth and cause bad breath and tooth decay. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. This treat may not help cat teeth, but they definitely won't hurt them. Also there are vitamins in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as ""dental,"" they really should have at least one dental ingredient. If your looking for a true dental treat, I recommend Crunch n' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have many beneficial dental ingredients either, but they are another pretty good one as they too contain vitamins but with a little bit of added breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are slightly better than these.",cats,2
"We have two cats, and both of them seem to like this toy the best. And that's saying something, because we spoil them so they have a lot of toys.

They love it, so we love it. Very good purchase. :)(That being said, we only use the original 'pointer' laser as that seems to give most results rather than the smiley/butterfly/etc. ones)A must buy!",cats,2

"I was desperate to get my white toy poodle's stained eyes to stay away. He was so cute except for these ugly stains around his eyes. He had stains so bad, kids on the street always asked me what was wrong with his eyes. I purchased different products but it was always a waste of money. I heard about different things from Tums to organic dog food to help it. Nothing worked. Cleaning the stains with peroxide on a Q-tip helped a little, but it made me so nervous.I was afraid it would get in his eyes. Finally we tried Angel eyes and it worked. He's been on it for a couple months and so far so good. I hope it doesn't stop working suddenly because he looks beautiful. His eyes are clear and stain free. I mix it in his food and he eats it with no problem. We tried a small bottle first and after good results we ordered the bigger bottle which winds up being more affordable. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to clear up those nasty stains from their white dog's eyes.",dogs,3
"The leash is a thin tape (1/2 an inch wide & as thick as a dime)on a retractable spring. It extends 26 feet, and self-retracts as the dog gets closer, or as you catch up to him. I was initially concerned the leash would break after being vigorously rubbed against trees, gates, walls, corners, etc, but it is strong material. Think of the stuff seat belts are made from, only thinner and narrower. This leash has been used for an 80-85 pound pit bull mix. It holds up just fine, even when he spots walking cheeseburgers (cats) in the vicinity and tries to sprint after them. I've dropped it a few times without any problems. I have several other leashes (a cord leash instead of a tape leash, a double leash for two dogs, and another tape leash) and this is the best. The other tape leash has failed after less than a month. This one has over 700 hours of use on it, and seems to have at least that much more. (roughly 6 months times 4-6 walks per day times 45-90 minutes per walk.)(edit",dogs,3

"My white german shepard pup was getting ticks like crazy and it was annoying having to her lay down as i search her entire body for those blood sucking creatures everyday. I tried other things for ticks but they didn't work. I looked around the internet and came across this collar that seemed to get plenty of good reviews. I was skeptical only because I'm not a fan of flea and tick collars. After getting it in the mail i bathed my baby, let her dry and i put the collar on her. She still had ticks for 3 days and I thought it wasn't working but then after a week she was completely tick free. Yay.",dogs,3
My vet told me I had to give my cat anti-biotics for 21 days! I felt crazy at this thought. My calico hates it when I try to shove a pill down her throat. I tried using the pill injectors but still it was high truama for my cat. Then I discovered pill pockets. They are a drean come true for me as my cat LOVES them and doesn't noticew that there's a pill inside. She just very happily gobbles it up and wants more! I was almost sorry that I was through giving her the pills but now I use them are treats and rewards just as they are.,cats,2
"I know my review is not really all that useful, but here goes...My package arrived sopping wet and smelling of eucalyptus and lemon or something. The bottle had busted open during shipping and all the contents had drained out before it got to me.

My cats now have a pleasing herbal smell, and seem to be high as a kite.",dogs,3
"Reasons why this is the best cat litter1) No more urine smell or ammonia at all! You know how when you get near a litter box it usually smells like urine? Using Worlds best cat litter, there is no more urine smell!2) Clumping is the best. Clumps do not get stuck to the bottom or sides. Most cat litters get urine clumps that stick to the sides and bottoms of the litter box, not with Worlds best cat litter.These reasons alone make Worlds best catter litter the best, I use a lot less litter as well since I am not constantly changing the entire litter box to get rid of the urine smell like I was using regular clumping litter.",cats,2
I bought this for my 1 year old Pointer pup a few months before Christmas and just the other day she punctured it. It's a great ball! It took about 2 days for her to really get used to it and get the idea that when she pushes it she is rewarded. She now gets kibble in it before I leave for work and as snacks during the day. All I have to ask is &#34;Where's your ball&#34; and she'll go to wherever she left it last and brings it rightover. She's also learned to toss it in my lap if I'm not paying attention to her. I bought one for her sister and one for my daughters cat... (the small version) both love it! It has a nice scent to it too... it lasts a long time. It doesnt smell like a plastic toy or the food you put in it. It's rather pleasent. I highly recommend it!,dogs,3

Until then, it is just a decorative fountain.",cats,2

"I LOVE this leash. I have purchased tons of stuff from Amazon and this is just the second review I have written. That says a lot. I have two small dogs (15 lbs each). They are good about walking next to me, but if you give them an inch they'll take the whole leash. I was tired of winding the leash around my hands to have it be the right length and have been looking for a short leash. I couldn't find anything shorter than 4 ft at the local stores. This one is perfect! I love the padded handle and the seat belt attachment option is a great bonus. I will say it's slightly heavier than a typical leash, but that doesn't outweigh the benefits of this leash (pun intended). Just so you know, the black pouch you see in the picture wraps around the seat belt attachment, it's not just flapping around while you walk. Now that I know how great it is, I will be ordering a second one for my other dog, and maybe a couple extra to give as gifts or to have as spares. My only complaint is about Amazon. The shipped it in a box big enough for 40 leashes. Crazy waste of a huge box. Not to mention the yards of air filled packing plastic.",cats,2

Most of all, I think my dog is grateful for this product.The only problem I see is if you have a car with no rear headrests or other ""attachment"". My car has those child seat attachment things in the back, so I just attach the hammock to those. I have added an extra set of buckles to my back straps so I dont have to keep feeding the straps through my child seat hooks.If I need to have human passengers in the back, it just takes a minute to remove the hammock, fold it up, and put it in the trunk.Love it!

It is always clean and it is so easy to empty. I use Everclean extra strength litter with it. I think the raters that had trouble with it picking up everything probably used cheap litters that didn't clump hard enough or quick enough. Great Product... I recommend this to all cat lovers.

The cats do kick some litter out, but I put a bathroom rug [that I cut to fit around the semi circle] in front of it and shake it out when needed.)",cats,2

Enter the Furminator, with spectacular results! The first comb-through on Stitch produced an staggering amount of fur and cat dander, and nearly the same amount on the 2nd combing. He was suspicious at first, but absolutely LOVES it now - comes running towards me as soon as I pick up the Furminator. The less hirsute kitties like it too, and there is a significant reduction in hairball production and free-flying fur in general. Usually, washing our brushed cotton blanket results in a lint trap FULL of cat fur, but with yesterday's washing, the fur barely covered the screen - I was genuinely surprised. So all in all, our household gives the Furminator a big thumbs up, and we would highly recommend it.",cats,2
Very good product. It does what it says it does. After 2 months using it our Coton de Tulear got perfectly clean eyes. We stoped giving it about 6 months ago and eyes still clean.,dogs,3

"I purchased this fountain approximately three years ago, and it shows no signs of necessitating a replacement. Longevity was one of my priorities when deciding to purchase a fountain for our three cats, so mission accomplished. Briefly:Pros:- My cats DO drink much more water than they have with a stagnant water dish. Cats do not naturally have a very strong thirst drive, so enticing them with running water undoubtedly enables their proper hydration (which prevents a host of health issues later on down the road).- Sound of running water is nice. I don't know what people were complaining about, as you can adjust how fast the fountain spouts water - it will be quieter if it's running faster, as there's less splashing.- Holds enough water for several days. When we go on vacation, I only have to instruct my pet sitter to check to make sure the fountain hasn't magically tipped over or something and that nothing has fallen into it, which is a relief. It puts me at ease knowing my cats aren't thirsty because they knocked over a flimsy water bowl.- The filter WORKS. We have very hard water where we live, so about every 1-2 weeks the filter needs to be changed because it develops a disgusting orange color and ceases to do its job. All that junk is not entering my cats' systems thanks to this fountain.- Lasts a long time. Three years and counting!Cons:- IRRITATING to clean, but it still only takes about 15 minutes to do a thorough job. There are a variety of tubes, edges, and corners that will consistently need to be disinfected. I normally make it a weekend chore, but depending on your pets/environment you might be able to only clean it every other week and still maintain the quality of the water.- Buying more extras... to even clean the fountain properly, you need to buy the Drinkwell kit designed for the job. And if you'd rather not have the occasional water splash on your floor, you also need to buy their water tray designed to keep the fountain grounded. When I tried to purchase this, the company was out of stock and had horrible communication, creating a very irritating ordeal, so good luck with that.- Motor is noisy? I have read people complaining about that, but a noisy motor only means you need to change the filter because it is too plugged up to allow the fountain to function as it should. Clean the fountain, change the filter, and you'll be good to go.All in all, I would definitely recommend the investment to any pet owner who is willing to maintain the upkeep of this fountain, as like others have said, not taking care of it renders it completely useless.",cats,2

"I will start out by saying, the only reason I did not give this product five stars is for the alcohol smell. It's not the best. Other than that, fabulous product! I bought this so that my German Shorthaired Pointer would stop thinking she was a woodchuck. Every time I turned around she was licking the buffet or gnawing on a table leg. That's not even mentioning the destroyed wicker chair and rug that now looks like a few pieces of thread. A few squirts around the edges of whatever she loved to chew did the trick. At first she would lick it, sniff it, lick again, and then make this horrible face and smack her lips. Then, she would walk away. Now, all she has to do is see me point the spray at something, and she will not touch it. It is a really great product. I highly recommend it. Also, it does not stain, so you can use it anywhere you need to. The alcohol smell fades as well.",dogs,3
This coat does not fit the head of the dogs good and I was not happy because the coat it self is great quality but they just don't make the hood large enough. So the dogs heads get wet. These coats are probably good for small dogs not medium dogs like mine I even ordered a larger size. I had to ship back the size that they say would fit my dogs. Not to happy with them.,dogs,3
Product works great. My cat is over 15 years old and has a hard time jumping on the bed and chair in the living room. I bought one for each of these locations and now my cat walks up the stairs very easily with no problems. The steps are very sturdy for a small pet and fold easily for storage. I don't know how secure they would be for a big dog but I would definitely recommend them for small pets. Thanks for a good product.Eric,dogs,3
"I have purchased at least 3 or 4 of these for my dog. She absolutely loves them, and lays on it every night. However, after 6 months or so, every one of them has started to leak at the seam, and we have to throw it away. The leak starts slowly at first, and then suddenly one day the carpet is really wet. They are a pain to move around too since they are heavy, if you buy the large one. Very hard to fix, too. I don't know if getting a bed sheet would help or not. Maybe we should reinforce the seams with duct tape before we even put water in it?But my dog (70 pound border collie mix) does really love this, summer or winter. So... I suppose I will get another one. I am a sucker for her sweet black and white face. :)",dogs,3

"My dog is a 4 year old maltese (10lbs) and I've been struggling with his marking/little accidents for pretty much as long as I've had him. I've tried other (larger) pens, belly bands, and couldn't crate him because I'm out of the house for so many hours in the day. This pen is the ONLY thing that has worked!! Its the perfect size for a small bed, a wee wee pad, and bowl of water/food, with walking room to spare. My dog actually loves hanging out in there too. It's enclosed enough to be his ""safe place"" and large enough so that I don't feel bad keeping him in there. The door is a great touch and allow easy entry and exit, most pens don't have doors. Its also really easy to take the pen apart for storage, which I have to do due to the lack of space in my small apartment. Excellent price too, can't say enough about this item.Only minor issue is that its pretty light and some days I find that my dog has moved the whole pen half way across the room. This is a small issue, which I'm sure can be easily solved by weighting the pen down.",dogs,3

"I am very happy with this feeder. I work full time and attend school some nights right after work, leaving my poor kitty alone and hungry all day (you do NOT leave a tortie with an empty plate or you will definitely hear about it when you get home!)My cat also used to start meowing as soon as my alarm clock goes off at 5:30 am, and if you are like me, you like to press ""Snooze"" a few more times before getting out of bed...wellll that doesn't fly when kitty wants her food first thing in the morning! I set this feeder to start dispensing at 6, so now she doesn't cry for me to feed her because she's fed before I'm even out of bed :)A bit on the expensive side, but it's really really worth it. I love that it plugs in/has an ac adapter as opposed to some battery operated feeders. Timer is very easy to set, just make sure you are properly measuring how much food comes out per how many seconds depending on kibble size, so as not to overfeed. My tortie would eat her weight in food and more if she could, even though she's a little thing.Most importantly, if I am staying at my bf's or my parents' house overnight, I don't have to rely on someone to come feed my cat anymore. This feeder has made life so much easier! I recently got a second kitty, and I saw how some reviewers made a dividing tube to dispense into two dishes...I may be doing that in the near future to ensure that they both get fed after the kitten comes off of kitten food. The only problem is making sure my older cat, who is only a year and a half, doesn't eat the kitten's share before he gets to.",cats,2
Has nice material though haven't washed as yet so don't know how that will go. My wife is a short person & has removed the back seat headrests so that she can see out the back & the straps are supposed to loop around the headrest poles.

Right now I have used some string to tie thru the gromets and have wrapped that around the plastic rings where the headrests should be. So far so good but definitely make do.,dogs,3
"Feeder works great! Cat no longer associates me with the feeding process alleviating the constant need for him to follow me every time I stand up to leave a room. The only thing I would say is that the directions supplied with the kit are fairly weak.

"we got this for our 85 lb, one year old american bulldog who had a habit of getting into all of the trash cans while we were gone and turning the house into a dump. she would also steal food off of our grandfather's (he lives with us) table every time he went to the bathroom. we got this e collar in hopes that it would put an end to her garbage rampages...and it has! i wasn't sure if it would even affect her at her size...but like other reviews have said, it gives a pretty good zap (of course i tried it on myself before putting it on my baby girl). she completely avoids all of the trash cans now! we haven't had to worry about coming home to a mess since we got this product!",dogs,3

"This is definitely a ""buyer beware"" item. As pictured (burgandy with carrying handles), it is the 16"" (smallest) model. we needed a 24"" carrier with handles. When we clicked on the item, and selected the size, we did not notice that the handles disappeared from the picture of the item we were buying. In addition, the color changed from burgandy to tan. The carrying handles are only available on the smallest model. Definitely deceptive. If you don't notice it, there's nothing you can do once you open the package. Since we had to open it to put it together, and then discover the lack of carrying handles (and th ecolor change), we cannot return the product according to Amazon's buying policy. We just spent $40 on a crate that can't be easily transported......However, it appears to be well constructed, and roomy enough....it's just not foing to fufill the purpose for which we bought it.

"This product is great for the lighter chewing dogs (5 stars), but would not recommend for strong chewers (3 stars). Thus a rating of 4 stars.I have 3 dogs at home (Tibetan Spaniel/King Charles Cavalier mix -10 lbs, Beagle/Terrier 45 lbs and Pitbull/Boxer 75 lbs). I have been trying to find an alternative to giving them bones or rawhide and this is a decent product for the two smaller dogs as they chew on this consistently. However for the Pitbull mix unfortunately as a strong chewer he can demolish it in one sitting as the plastic starts to break off into little pieces.So for dog owners that are not strong chewers I highly recommend this product (5 stars) but for dogs with strong jaws I would find something else.",dogs,3

I had been getting them at Trader Joe's (under their own label) and I was distraught when they were discontinued (fortunately I did not tell my dog, because she would have been inconsolable). A quick Google search brought me to Amazon and these biscuits--which had been packaged under private label for TJ.Now I no longer have to worry about reproachful looks when she doesn't get her favorite cookies.Reasonably priced, they are easy to break in half or in quarters and great for dogs that cannot chew hard biscuits--or to hide a pill inside.",dogs,3

I purchased this for a cat. We needed to keep her closed in at nights. It is nice and roomy for her. It took her about 5 days to get used to it. The crate went together fairly easy. It is sturdy.

"Tapeworms are easiest to prevent if you know their lifecycle. Tapes are caused by cats ingesting fleas usually from prey that they have eaten like a mouse or rat. They could also ingest a flea from grooming themselves if they have fleas. So, in addition to getting rid of the tapes you must also get rid of the fleas if possible. Tapes are not passed from cat to cat unless the fleas are passed. Any new pet should be treated for fleas before it is introduced to another pet so the fleas are not passed.PRaziquantel is one way to worm for tapes. It is very effective as long as you can get the cat to eat it which is best accomplished by putting it in chicken baby food or some treat the cat REALLY likes. Also, the cat needs to be isolated so that they get all the medicine especially if there are multiple cats in the house.The BEST way is to go to a vet you have a client-patient relationship with and get topical Profender. It is amazing and is great especially for cats that are difficult to treat orally.",cats,2

Only the lettering wore off (no big deal). However, this weekend I accidentally threw it into a very deep pond. Come to find out it doesn't float.

So, I ordered the platinum, and I'm SO happy that I did.The first thing I noticed was how much quieter the platinum is over the original. I can hardly even hear the water splashing, and that annoying hum of the motor is gone. Most importantly to me, this one holds quite a bit more water. I had a clip-on extra reservoir for my old fountain, yet I was still having to fill it every day. I do have a lot of cats, but that was annoying. The platinum stayed full so long after I first filled it that I thought it wasn't working properly. Now I can go 2-3 days before I have to add water.

"When I discovered the Litter Locker I was thrilled. Living in an upstairs apartment, and a far walk to the trash dumpster, I used to scoop my cat's litter into a brown bag, then place it in a plastic bag, and then toss it in the trash can, and every time I entered the room again (my litter box was in my master bathroom), I would smell that horrible cat urine smell. Then I started putting the brown bags in another trash can in the closet in an effort to hide the smell, but every time I opened the closet door that smell would hit me like a ton of bricks, so eventually I just ended up running it out to the trash dumpster just to get rid of the odor. Drove me nuts. Now that I have the Litter Locker, I place it in the corner next to the toilet, and I swear, they must have used magic when making the plastic used in the refill cartridges, because I cannot smell anything at all, even when sittting right next to it. It's a wonderful product, and so convenient. Now I only empty the cartridge about every two weeks, and I just change it on trash day so it goes from the Litter Locker right to the dumpster. You will love this product.",cats,2

"I owned two of the older LitterMaids for several years. While not perfect, at least they worked. Recently, one stopped working and wasn't worth fixing. So I thought I'd replace it with the new LME model. WRONG MOVE.First, much of the plastic on the LME model is flexible. Unfortunately, flexible isn't always good. Second, there are no latches on this so the top just sits on the pan portion. Third, the slope where the rake sits in ""home"" position means that stuff gets trapped behind the rake until you scoop it out yourself. Fourth, the rake no longer moves far enough over the receptacle to properly work; much of what's raked up falls right back into the pan. Fifth, mine stopped working after just a few months; the rake/motor unit gets stuck and just sits in the same place, making a clicking sound. Taking the unit apart, cleaning it, adjusting the position of the rake/motor did nothing. So now I've got what amounts to a manual box.I recently replaced this dud with the older LM920 box. Am buying a couple more of those just in case.",cats,2
"I've only written one review before, but am compelled to write one for this ball. It's designed to be just big enough to not fit in the back of a dog's mouth, so it won't get destroyed because the back teeth can never chew it. After one year of their old 'model' (not recycled material), my dog finally got a little crack in the ball by one of the two holes the ball has in it. The ball is still going strong (it even survived going down a storm drain and showing up in a nearby riverbank 2 months later), but I got him a new one for Christmas for the heck of it.The printed graphic will wear off in a matter of minutes, and then the ball is just one color after that (I got a nice blue one). My dog goes nuts for this ball - so much we can't even let him have it inside because he'll just chew on it all day long. And he instantly runs to this ball over all the ones we have when we go outside - it's in an entirely different class of toy, apparently. If he can't find it, he won't even look at his other balls, and he'll just stare at me like the world is going to end unless I find this particular ball.I haven't noticed any wear (other than the graphic) or odor. The only issue you may have is that it squeaks a little as they chew it (not a squeaker toy, but just the material sliding in their mouth), and because it's hollow, it makes a kind of popping noise once in a while if the dog is really chewing hard on it as it snaps back into place.Planet Dog makes other balls, but I really like this one because there's no little plastic bits on it that the dog can grab onto - it's just a smooth ball.",dogs,3

After a few weeks of wearing it and working with it though she has become less responsive to my correcting her with a gentle yes constant tug on the leash to get her to heel.

Time for the ""common sense test."" What do you think is the better bargain? Anyway, this medication works wonderfully and now our pom is no longer wheezing and panting on those hazy, lazy spring/summer days. If you have any doubts, do yourself a favor and just buy this product here. You will not be disappointed.",cats,2

"can not go wrong. It keeps the guinea pig hay off the floor of the cage, and the hay waist has been cut by 90%. It holds the hay in place, and therefor the guinea pig is able to pull a piece without a ton falling to the floor. I have 2 cages and was able to see 1st hand how much hay was being eaten with the use of the hay ball, to how much was being thrown away due to being on the floor of the cage (might add my pigs will not eat hay that is on the floor of their cage) from not using the hay ball. So u know it, I bought #2 for the other guinea pig cage. They also have learned that playing with the bell gets them more hay.up date, it is now Aug and I am still loving the hay ball, I have save money by using them, there is very little waist, I find it easy to fill, and u can really pack the hay in, u just have to as stated, pack it in. My pigs do just fine with pulling the hay out no matter how much and tight I pack it in. Before the hay ball I bought hay every month, now I am buying hay every 3 months. Very pleased.",bunny rabbit central,1

"I bought the Lazy Pet Plush Condo for my three cats - all are between 9 & 13 lbs. The two larger cats could not fit comfortably in this, but none of them were interested anyways. They tried it once or twice and then it sat in the house for months never to be touched again. I gave it to my mom for her cats. Again, they looked at it a few times and lost interest. We finally donated it to charity. Besides the lack of interest from the cats, the design is rather flimsy. I suspect this is why my cats didn't like it. When they tried to sit on top of it, it would shake unsteadily. When they leaned against it to scratch, it wobbled. I think for the money you could find a much better product.",cats,2

"We've been using this product for years and feel it is the best of its kind on the market. We initially purchased it for occasional pet stains but discovered it does much more. It is great for a variety of stains on carpets, clothing, etc. So even though out current pets never have ""accidents,"" we still use this regularly for other things.Other stains we use it for include mud, coffee/tea, grass stains, food stains such as mustard and catsup, food coloring, and more. For particularly bad stains on clothing and linens, we first clean the spot directly, then add about half a cup or so to the washing machine (amount depends on the size of the load). We've always been pleased with the results.We do not buy it through Amazon, however, because we found it at a considerably lower price at a local discount retailer. So unless you need home delivery or simply prefer online shopping, you might want to price-shop for this.But regardless of how or where purchased, this product really works. It gets stains and odors out, including those from pet ""accidents."" In terms of pet stains, it works best (easiest) if you're lucky enough to catch the stain while it is still damp. But we've also had good luck with older stains by cleaning a spot multiple times with this product. On older stains, the odor didn't always go away completely, but the improvement was significant and ""livable.""In our experience, Kids N Pets works much better than Natures Miracle and a couple of other enzyme cleaners we tried.",cats,2

The dog is usually about 5 feet from our bedroom window and barks all day and night, the owner not caring.This device arrived in the mail about a week ago. A few clicks of this device when it barks and it shuts up. It took a few days for the dog to associate bark with the unpleasant noise, however, by the end of the first day the dog's barking was reduced 75% or more. The number of times it starts to bark is down from about 20 a day to, maybe, 5... if that. It takes one to two clicks of the button now to shut it up.This device will not work without consistency. The dog has to associate barking with the noise. Click it only when the dog barks",dogs,3

"I can't say enough good things about this fence. After months of chasing our dogs down at the neighbors, and fretting over the cost of a fence for over a 1/2 acre of yard, we settled on this. With this fences low low cost, we were able to fence in the entire acre instead of just half and they have a bunch more room to run.We have been using this fence for well over two months now.It is a wonderful thing to not have a fence blocking our views (lake) and not having the upkeep of a wooden or metal fence. Not to mention we'd have to weed eat all along a conventional fence, with this, you can mow right over it.At first I was worried our dogs wouldn't venture in the yard to play and run as they were SO obedient of the fence they stayed really close to the back door. But after some additional training/playing with them in the yard and feeding them treats all over the yard, they finally got the full idea of the boundaries. I am sure some of that was our training abilities, or maybe that they are such sensitive dogs. Now they run for hours and we never worry, and when they come inside they are tired and have a good sleep!I have the collars set on 2, the lowest correction and it's more than enough for our Standard Poodles to get the idea that once the collar starts to buzz and beep that a static correction is not far behind.SUCCESSFUL TESTING:Our dogs have been tested with many birds, squirrels on the property edge, horseback riders on the road, cats walking the perimeter of the yard, people walking by...you name it, and they have never ventured as far as getting shocked. Only once (with the cat) did they even get close enough for the collar to beep, and that turned them right back around to stay in the yard.THIS FENCE IS WONDERFUL and only about 5-8% of the cost of an above ground fence (for us) even with the additional collar we had to buy.I love that is takes NORMAL BATTERIES; it will be a breeze to change them out.Careful with the collars and the sensitivity of your pets neck. Once they were fully trained, I loosened up the collar and now I believe just the weight of it is enough for them and the contacts don't need to be touching their skin.Totally recommended!",cats,2

I found this, and then attached the pieces together...However, two weeks later, the lead broke in another place...I tried to fix it, and it broke again. This was all while the dog was in the yard, being supervised. He did not chew it...It might have gotten tangled in a twig, but that is about all. I still have a another lead that I bought..Paid a bit more for it, and it is still intact after 6 months.",dogs,3
These little springs are great! My cat loves to fling them and chase them. They are very light and skid across the floor so easily they are easy for a cat to chase around the room. I do wish they were just a little larger only because they go under my stove and other little places. If they made them just a little bigger they would be perfect! I highly recommend these and highly recommend that you supervise your cat playing with these. I actually have a toy chest for my cat and I pick up all of his toys when I am not able to watch him play with them.,cats,2
"I did not measure the size of the mussle, but took it from the chart based on a breed (irish setter). We decided to get a muzzle to keep him from eating poop of other animals when he is off leash in the park. The muzzle fits perfectly, we are very happy about that. It took him about two weeks to adjust; I was putting some peanut butter in the muzzle, keeping the muzzle on for several seconds at the beginning and up to a minute or two by the second week. Every time he had a muzzle on, we would play and have fun; after the muzzle is off do not pay attention to the dog, he should feel bored for a while. By the end of second week he was able to wear the muzzle for 10-15 min, and during the third week he was happily running in it for two hours. Sometimes he wants to remove the muzzle and struggles with it for thirty seconds, but it stays on, never became loose. Our dog is very hyper by breed, he was not able to adjust to ""gentle leader"" head leash (just hates it), but OK with this muzzle. He also swims in it if near the water and able to drink while swimming. He is still trying to eat poop, muzzle becomes dirty,(easy to clean) but at least this stuff is not in his mouth.",dogs,3

And every day since they love taking all the little squirrels out and squeaking them. The squirrels are kind of small, so I was worried at first, but they have held up very well. No rips or tears in the squirrels or stump home. If you have a toy shredder, the dog that intentionally rips everything up in 2 minutes, it's kind of expensive for that, but just awesome for a dog that loves to play and not destroy.",dogs,3

He truly enjoys riding in his pack, and has gone as long as an all-day hike comfortably (with stretching/walking breaks, of course). I like the clip attachment and tie security for extra protection. That being said, I would love to see a sturdier design for this product. The straps are flimsy, the snap buckles plastic, and the base folds up. Stronger straps and back design would help hold up a heavier dog. Still, this product has helped my little pack bond on a favorite activity. This medium size is good for Finn--he's 5 lbs, 10 inches long. A small size would be uncomfortable. He has room for a blanket and sweater for cooler weather.",dogs,3

But that's the way of cats.I give it 3 stars because it does indeed work as promised. And even after a week the water appears clean. I can't say the same happens with the other two namebrand cat fountains that I have.There was no plastic smell except for a rather strong one in the soft plastic tube that runs from the pump to the connection on the bowl. But it didn't seem to alter the water any. But I don't have the nose of a cat.UPDATE 01/05/2009It's two years later and my Drinkwell pump died. To tide over my cat (who desperately misses his Drinkwell) until the replacement pump arrives, I pulled this out of the closet. It's been nearly 2 weeks and guess what? He still finds this entertaining and will sit an stare at it every so often, but has yet to take a drink. He even goes over an smells around it, and seems to want to take a drink sometimes, but doesn't.My guess is that he finds the bubbles/rush of air disturbing?",cats,2

"Searched long to find the right filter. These Bio filters with multiple chambers for media is the way to go with turtles. We have a female red ear slider about 7 inches front to back of shell (she was about the size of a silver dollar when we got her two years ago). She is very messy and the in tank filter was just not handling it. This filter with fresh water and a good shell scrubbing of our baby has worked fine. We used to have to clean her tank and change water every week to keep her water from getting too filthy. This filter in a forty gallon aquarium has been set up for three months now and other than adding water as it evaporates and cleaning her rocks we haven't had to do anything else except feed her. We did clean out the filter once because she made a mess of some fresh aquatic plants we bought for her. She chewed up fifteen dollars worth of plants in just two days. She probably ate some but most of them were chewed and left floating. The filter clogged from all the plant material. But I can't blame the filter for that. The water is always crystal clear. She seems to love her environment now.There is a couple of things to keep in mind when using the filter for turtles. The intake tubing inside the tank comes in sections that have to be pushed together. They tend to loose prime at the connections because turtle tanks are only about half full and some of the connections are above the water level. I had to glue them together to keep the prime. The filter has to absolutely be at least 16 inches below the tank bottom. I set ours on the floor and the tank on the top of a 29 inch high credenza. When priming remember to fill the tube with water with the filter hose valve in the off position (the instructions will explain). Make sure there are no air leaks and screw on the cap tightly on the prime hole when you are done priming. With no air leaks in the intake hose, the tank about half full or more and the top of the filter about 16 inches below the bottom of the tank when you lock the hoses in place which opens the valves the weight of the water in the intake hose should pull water through the intake tube to fill the filter and you should at this point have a prime. This should now let you turn the filter on without loosing prime and your tank should stay clean like ours for months. This filter has three cannisters and each cannister has two chambers. We are using the foam layers as they came with the filter, two large pore followed by two small pore foams filters in the first cannister (this is from the bottom of the filter to the top). The water moves around the cannisters to the bottom of the filter and is pulled up to the top. So the set up is from the bottom up. The second cannister we used for the biomass. We used the round pellets in the first (bottom) chamber with a mesh top (included), followed by the star biomass media in the second chamber (top). In the third cannister we used nitrate/nitrite (white amonia media) in the first chamber followed by a mesh and then charcoal media in the second chamber with a micron filter on top followed by another mesh. Then we placed the top on that and closed it. After about a month and a half we had the plant incident and had to clean the filter. I just rinsed everything out real good except for the biomass media which I lightly rinsed (you want to keep the bacteria that collects on the media because this helps eat the chemicals in the water and solids). I then replaced everything again and it has been working great since. They recommend changing the carbon every month but we haven't yet. They also recommend changing the nitrate/nitrite media every ten months, so we have a while to go. The micron filter needs to be changed also after a few months. I wouldn't change the foam unless it is clogged to the point were I can't get it cleaned out. It is only to collect solids and retain them till they decompose and are absorbed by the bacteria.I think any multiple chamber filter would work as well. I am skeptical about anything below three chambers for turtles. One large turtle I think is the equivalent of a thousand fish in feces and pee (that's just my guess). This filter is rated for a much bigger tank but I think a smaller filter would not have worked for a turtle as large as ours. Turtles do grow fast and keep growing. They also live for forty years so get a large filter that will handle larger tanks. If you can afford it I would go for the XP4 which is bigger and rated for larger aquariums. For turtles I think multiple chambers are really important because they do not need oxygen in the water since they do not have gills but they do need clean water to stay healthy and they are super, super, mega super messy.The biggest complaints I have read from turtle owners about filters is getting a prime. Remember, you can not have any air leaks in the intake tube or hosing. We are going to look for a solid tube that we can cut to use for our intake so we do not have connections above the water.Cons",fish aquatic pets,4

"My dogs never had a negative reaction to Advantix in 5 years. It is very effective at controlling fleas and ticks and not nearly as smelly as other products.

Buy the medications specific to your situation, use the medications exactly as directed, don't mix meds, and the first time you use any chemical product watch for signs of distress, especially in pets and children who don't easily communicate discomfort. With those considerations, I think you can use this product with confidence.The pet owner whose animal had a bad reaction to Advantix and left the negative review is understandably upset, but remember, NO CHEMICAL PRODUCT is without it's risks.. none is 100% safe.

"I gave this thing the benefit of the doubt after reading some of the reviews on here, like how the turtles will start chowing down on the dock. My turtles are extreme wimps. They won't even eat the tiny goldfishes that I had in the tank. This brings me to exactly how horrible this dock is. I don't know if they did something new or found a new way to make this thing, but the minute I took it out of the box, I felt this weird oil and it was extremely sandy, like the styrofoam was disintegrating in my hand. Maybe it was just extra parts of it. I can't tell. The dock was also very dark, almost black, with spots of green, I guess to look like algae or grass or something, but it wasn't pretty. It didn't look like the picture on the box at all! I thought I had received someone's used one until I did a little research. Anyways, back to oil. I proceeded to clean the dock, with a very mild dish washing detergent so it'll cut through the oil and hopefully wash it away. After, I soaked the dock in clean water for 2 days, TWO DAYS, changing water twice a day to make sure any traces of detergent would be gone. On the second day, there was still oil coming out of the dock, but it was very little. To the point where I had to look for it so again, gave it benefit of the doubt, put it into my tank. My turtles loved it. They immediately started playing on it, but the goldfishes that I had in the tank all died, within 30 minutes. They've been in the tank with my turtles for almost 2 weeks now!! They've literally became friends with my turtles!! I immediately pulled out my turtles. My turtles are okay, but the oil or whatever the dock was emitting CANNOT be good for any sea creatures.

"My cats were lovin this thing even as I was putting it together! It gets quiter after a few days of running. The pump makes some noises when the water is running low. Water resevior is not the biggest, but adequate for 2 fat and thirsty kitties! I suggest rinsing the charcoal filters for a few minutes in the sink before putting the new filter into action. My cats are my best friends, and anything I can do to make them happy, I will do. The investment to bennifit ratio on this product is astronomical! Just buy it, you wont regret it.",cats,2
"This is the best product I have ever given to my dogs. Their coats improved so much if I had not seen it I would not have believed it. I have Chesapeake Bay Retrievers and beagles, all six dogs look great because of this product.",dogs,3
We have used Frontline Plus for several years and we came back for more. But this year the ticks seem to have overcome the barrier and our dogs get infested with ticks. We took them to the local groomer who cleaned them up but also reported that her clients using Frontline are having major tick problems this year. Not sure if they changed the formula or if we now have super ticks that are immune to Frontline - but beware !,dogs,3
"I just got two of these today, so I will update more after they get some use. I think they are a nice color for dog food bins and they seem to open easy enough for me to get in, but hopefully the dogs won't be able to open them. I think if I latch them properly that shouldn't be a problem. I am getting them because my seven month old puppy has figured out how to get into my other storage container, so I will report back if he figures it out.My only concern is that these are really large bins. The measurements are in the description, and I read that, but I recommend that you get a box or something with those measurements if you intend for this storage to be in the open in your home or if you will be putting them in a closet with limited space. They are much bigger than I realized. I think they will hold the full bags of dog food and seem to stack pretty well. Overall these were what I needed, but they are a bit bigger than I pictured in my head!",cats,2
"My new little guy got this for Christmas from his ""Aunt"" and he absolutely loves this! I have gotten other toys - automatic lasers, circular scratching board with ball that travels around it, countless filled mice and other animals..but this one is the best! He sleep wtih it, and leaves it in my bedroom which he considers his sanctuary. He is still full of energ at 18 months, so this is a good way to tire him about when I get home from work. Great idea!",cats,2
"I read reviews at great length before I ordered this product. I was so excited by the great reviews..I couldn't wait for it to arrive so I could give it to my finicky eater...assuming she'd just gobble it down. But no...she sniffed at it and walked away! To me, the product looks and smells delicious! I've opened and offered the food 4 or 5 times...and occasionally my stubborn viszla will eat a LITTLE...just to appease me I'm sure.So I'm writing this review so those of you who have really finicky dogs won't get TOO excited about this food. Not ALL dogs are wild over it! Mine isn't... If I ever run out of food, however, I'll probably try it myself! hahaha...",dogs,3
"Whether your feline will opt to tear this up in lieu of a leatherette couch is purely a question of individual preference. My big Himalayan kitten didn't evince any interest in it before I poured some of its enclosed catnip upon it, and hasn't since. However, my older cat excitedly claws it and chews its edges. Nonetheless, you'll surely fare better with a scratching post; housecats are commonly inclined to stretch and rise when mauling savagely, so an upright target is naturally preferable.Despite the robust construction of its box, this pad's price is absurdly high for a chunk of corrugated cardboard!",cats,2

"The fumes from the paint varnish used on this castle was extreme, the smell did not go away after 3 days of being submerged under water. Every time the tank top was lifted, the fumes escaped and smelled so strongly, I hate to think what it did to the water and would do to any living thing that had to breathe that water. I ended up taking it out and draining the tank and starting over. No way this is for anything inside of a fish tank. A shame and complete waste of money.",fish aquatic pets,4

If there is one toy you should buy your cat it is this one. My cat plays with this at least 10 times a day. She also loves it when I get involved and hit the ball around. This toy will amuse your cat for hours on end. I would have bought this for way more for the enjoyment she gets out of it.,cats,2
"This stuff is amazing. I put it on my cat's food every day. Without it he gets terrible bladder infections from his herpes. He never gets bladder infections now unless I forget to put it on his food, so I keep about 6 bottles of this stuff on hand. It also has helped improve (but not eliminate) the amount of goop that is always running from his eyes. He still has runny eyes, but they are not congested now. This stuff has really improved his quality of life. I highly recommend it to anyone whose cat has herpes.",cats,2
"What was I THINKING??? Of course these cause stinky gas. Don't you have that when you eat deviled eggs on the holidays? I love the Charlee Bear Dog treat line, however, I have to get rid of my 16 ounces of treats because my yellow lab is continually passing gas when I have given him these. Labs are notorious for stomach issues, so it could be that, but I won't get this flavor again.",dogs,3
"My 6 year old rat terrier mix and 3 year old bichon love filled toys and bones. I saw this and decided to give it a try.The shipping was prompt and was exactly as it described. If the bone is cold from the weather when you get it, I suggest letting it warm up a bit since a lot of dogs can push the filling out if it's stiff.My dogs went crazy over it! You couldn't distract them from it for a second. I recommend this for any dogs that love to chew on bones or that love toys that can be filled.",dogs,3
"If your cat is the kind who likes to play pretend-mouser, they will love this mouse.It's more expensive than other mice, but the arched back and stubby legs set this mouse apart. My cat always carries this mouse in her mouth with its feet facing down, just like carrying a real mouse by the scruff of its neck. It's lightweight, but bigger than most small mice. It's easy for her to throw into the air, all by herself. Its overall roundish shape also lets it ""roll"" across the floor when she bats it around. I've noticed that in some fuzzy toys, the hair/fuzz pulls out too easily, but this mouse has short soft fur that doesn't pull out. Washes easily (it gets dunked in the water bowl a lot), but the tail is made of a thin, unstuffed tube of fake suede/velvet cloth (it gets eaten quickly). Mouse holds up to constant biting, water-dunking, and play-time with clawed cats.",cats,2

"I found this toy brand new at a local thrift store for about 45 cents. 45 cents for some wire and cardboard bits for something touted as ""the world's greatest cat toy"", how could I NOT buy it?I was skeptical that such an odd toy would pique my cat's interest. It's just some thin bouncy wire with 5 cardboard tubes at the end that bobs up and down erratically when you hang on to it. Well, as soon as I took it out my cat freaked. He would not leave this thing alone! He could be completely dead to the world asleep and if you pick this toy up he will bolt over and try to grab it. My guess is the cardboard looks extremely similar to a flying bug and the wire is largely unnoticed. I've found my cat entertaining himself with this toy, just batting the end around and dragging it from room to room.Sadly, it does not hold up well. Within a few weeks the cardboard was almost all torn off, and the wire got bent up. I'm on the hunt for the right kind of wire so I can make these at home, but still, it's well worth the money.",cats,2

I have a 3 month puggle and this particular size doesn't seem to be enough for a day. I end up using 2/day even after taking him to pee outside in between. It also leaks and doesn't absorb as much as some others that I have tried before.,dogs,3
"I read all the mixed reviews and decided that I should give the product a shot. I have a cat that is obsessed with having food in his bowl at all times and my schedule can be irregular. If his bowl is empty he will then eat all of the food I put in it, get sick, and a few minutes later the food will reappear somewhere in the house. This is how he scams me into giving him extra food or feeding him early. I figured if I didn't personally feed him he might not get as much food and thus my cat might one day weigh less than the 20+ lbs he weights right now. I must admit that programming the feeder was slightly challenging but the 4 or 5 minutes it took to get it all straight was well worth it to have timed feedings. My cat is a bit skittish, so he does still jump when his food is deployed...3 feedings a day for a month and he's still not 100% sure what it's going to do to him. Overall I am very pleased with this product and I think my cat is eating less now that there is some food in his bowl at all times. Additionally, I have found no ""used"" food around my house since the feeder was setup. Hopefully his roly-poly tummy will soon see some benefit too!",cats,2
I have a small dog and I don't always pick up her signals to be let out. I have placed the pad next to the litter box in the bathroom. I have tried many different brands of pads but the are too thin and the floor under them gets wet and smells bad. These pads are nice and thick an the back of them does not allow the floor to get wet. They are easier to pick up and dispose of. Thank you for a great product.,dogs,3
"The Waterer was okay, a bit difficult to fill up and then flip over into the bin. Would be better if had an opening at the top to fill as it is already in position. However, the major problem I had, was the shipping of the item was the WORST!!! I had purhased this item, as I was going on vacation for a week and wanted my 2 cats to have plenty of water, and at the last minute I had to go out and buy another watering system, because there was a HUGE dent in it that would not come out. It was nearly crushed in half. I did contact the seller and I was offered to return it to them and I would receive a credit less the shipping cost, however, the cost of returning it through UPS (seller's choice) and the extra effort was not worth returning the item. I would have only got about 50% of the amount I paid back from the seller.",cats,2

"I bought one of theseBooda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop, Pearlfor the first time about 6 years ago. It was great ~ I liked having a discreet and neat place to store the scoop in my cat's poop and scoop corner.Only recently did the scoop break ~ the handle snapped off right in the middle of a scoop. It was messy and unpleasant with plastic, litter and you can guess what else flying everywhere. I looked all over for another scoop to fit the holder or just another set but had no luck. I just happened across this set at Amazon (couldn't find a replacement scoop though) and was delighted to purchase it for about the same price as I did 6 years ago.Unfortunately the quality of my second one (same Booda brand) is not the same. The scoop is not as sturdy as before and feels so flimsy, I am afraid I am going to have a repeat episode of the last break soon. There is way too much give with every plunge into the litter and the handle bends under the weight of even the lightest load. This scoop will definitely not last another 6 years.That's very disappointing and I will not be buying theBooda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop, Pearlagain, at Amazon or anywhere. I am however going to keep my eyes open for another scoop which will fit in the holder because I love the storage concept. Isn't it odd that Booda doesn't offer a replacement scoop though?***October 15, 2010 REVISED REVIEW AND LOWER RATING***Unfortunately I have had to drop my rating from 3 stars to 1. The handle of the scoop broke off mid-scoop this morning. What a piece of crap.",cats,2
"My dog just LOVES this. I have to make it fairly difficult for her, and even then she has all her food out in about 15 minutes, but that's 14 minutes longer than it takes her to eat it out of her bowl, so I'll take it! This is the 2nd one I've purchased in the last 2 months, so I can have a spare one filled and ready to go.",dogs,3
Bought this for a friend but she likes it enough that she's going to get another one for more cats.,cats,2
"Just got this coat in the mail and I love it. It is so cute and I think the quality is pretty good considering the price is so low. My favorite thing though, is that you put the coat on using adjustable velcro straps around the neck and stomach. With our dog's last coat we had to pull her legs through these arm holes to get it on and she hated that and never wanted to wear it, so this is great. My dog is a mixed breed, 42 lbs and 21 inches from neck to tail and I got the large. It fits perfectly. I'd highly recommend this, it looks very warm. To answer another user's question, my dog is a girl but the coat looks like it would work for boy dogs as well. The cut is pretty high up.",dogs,3

"When my energetic kitten started spraying litter all over the floor, I sought a solution- this high-sided box in conjunction with a textured mat beneath it. It helped immensely. For the better part of a year. As kitty grew, though, it was no longer just litter spraying around. Yeh, yuck. Then he got clever and started turning to face the high end, squirting over the low end, past the catch mat, onto my wooden floors. When I turned the box, he over-sprayed onto my wall. No longer a kitten, but a muscular 13-pound male, I knew I needed a new solution. This litter pan was great for my kitten, but as he grew, not for my big male cat.I liked this pan for quite a while. For a smaller cat, or a female, I think it is very good, and solves some problems. The price was certainly right.I ended up buying a new box",cats,2
It's a good slicker and comfortable to use. It worked well with my Lagotto's puppy coat but now as it has thickened and curled I've had to use a bent pin slicker to be able to get through the coat. I'd definitely only recommend it for a soft thinner coated breed.,dogs,3

"We bought these for our dog who has some anxiety problems. This is the treat of last resort when he can't calm down. We stick these in the blue treat-holder, and he's occupied for about 20-30 minutes. It's a great distraction. I was hoping they'd last a little longer, but he's pretty tired out by the time he finishes and calmed considerably. We have the medium size for our smaller 50lbs pit bull mix. They are his favorite thing.",dogs,3

"Gunnar is my 11 month old Dobermann, and he loves squeaky toys. Loves them so much it takes him all of two minutes to surgically separate their internals. That was until I got him a Bad Cuz. Been three weeks and it's still standing, still mostly in one piece, and still squeaking as loud as day one. He did try to rip the horns off the little devil and it's full of little dings from him biting it, but all in all, it's one tough little toy - the best squeaky I've bought him so far!",dogs,3
This is a great deal. So much cheaper than the pet store. My dog loves these and it helps her breath smell better. It used to be terrible but she has gotten better after eating these. I just wish they lasted longer for her as she can chew one up in about 2 minutes.,dogs,3
"I had hoped that the novelty of the clever design would make an onorous chore a little less ""gross"", but in all the time I tried it I was, variously, disappointed, annoyed and disgusted. The shell is of a plastic that isn't nearly strong enough for it's task, the little clasp/slides that attach the shells together are flimsy at best, and litter leaked everywhere even when I managed to get the clasp/slides firmly closed. I stopped rocking it after the third collapse and just used it as a regular hooded box.I also saw a cat expert say that cats find it to be a big ""wrong"" if they go into a space that has the scent of urine everywhere (especially above their heads). In the simple action of rolling it the previous scent spreads out all over it. So no, I do NOT recommend this to anyone. Maybe others managed to make it work, but mine went out to the curb after too many failures. And no, you can't return it if it's been used.",cats,2

"Due to our last winter not being cold enough we have really had a big problem with fleas. I've been treating my pets with Advantix for years and it simply wasn't working this year. I read that I should try Frontline ( different chemical, maybe better results). But it didn't work either....I have sprayed their kennels, dog houses etc, even been treating them with DE. There are fewer fleas but they still have some. Will try a different product after this one's effects have worn off. The Advantage for cats if working great though. Don't think its the product, but for me it didn't help.Will pray for a cold winter, too.",dogs,3

I purchased this in late 2011 because my 1 cat will only drink from the faucet. I figured this would be the fresh water effect I needed. I took completely apart at least 1x a week but rinsed it out every day. I scrubbed it and rinsed the filter as well. In May 2012 I noticed some brown fleks floating in the water. The filter was brand new...only used it for about 2 weeks. I pulled it out and it was completely covered in a brown sludge! I was disgusted!! Took it apart and even used a bottle brush to get into whatever areas I could. Again the fleks showed up...again washed it thoroughly. This happened several times. I noticed there is a narrow area that is very slim that nothing can fit in. Apparently it builds up a mold or something. I am so frustrated since I took it thoroughly apart every week and let it dry for almost 24 hrs before putting it back together again. I refuse to use it because now I am afraid my cats will get a bacteria from it. This is the 2nd one I purchased. The first one which I THOUGHT was great...except about a month after purchasing started noticing my floor was getting wet. I am so glad I didnt put it directly on the rug..but on a rubber mat underneath. The entire thing was leaking!! I would NOT recommend this.,cats,2

This toy comes to room temperature within seconds of removing it from the freezer. The ribbons were gone by the end of day 1. It essentially became a chew toy that my small puppy destroyed within a week or two. The only interesting feature was the crinkle sound it made as he chewed on it.,dogs,3
I'll update this review if all gets fixed but I bought this thing because I was going on vacation and I came back to a dead litter robot full of poop. I even had someone checking it daily and they told me it just stopped powering up. There are other issues like the cats will try to get in it while it's cleaning and it can get gummed up pretty fast. It may be a very awesome litter box if I can get it fixed. I emailed support which is supposed to respond until 10PM EST but received no response.,cats,2

"I bought this to replace a regular 6ft leash. I got the medium version rated for 77 pound dogs since my dog is about 50 pounds and likes to pull. The retractable mechanism works really well - smooth and doesn't tangle. The 16-foot length seems just right where the dog has lots of freedom but you are still in full control.I'm glad I got the all belt version. This protects you from cutting your skin with the thin cord, feels stronger, and in my opinion looks better.The only problem I have with this product is that the handle is slightly too small for my hand. For reference I'm a 5'11 male. The grip is good size but the opening is a bit too small. It's not a serious issue but could be improved.",dogs,3
"Lulu, our French Bulldog LOVES these chews. Out of all the toys/chews I have bought these are the best. She will play for hours with it and chews and chews and chews.

"Like everyone else posting a review here, I am getting great results with this little tool! I have noticed less shedding in the house - hooray! The first time I used it, I removed so much fur from Crash that I was sure he would have bald patches. Not so - just a lot of extra fur in his undercoat I couldn't see. He's leash-trained, so we've incorporated combings into our walking routine and he seriously seems to love it. I definitely second those reviewers who advise using this tool outside - whole bird colonies have created nests from the fur flying off this tool! Note that Amazon is offering a great price on this item as compared to local retail stores and vet offices.",cats,2
"For anyone who has experienced the unfortunate after-effects of cat pee, you know what I mean when I say you, cannot get it out.Many years ago, after exhausting all other possibilities, I discovered Nature's Miracle. I have a cat that is getting very old and I believe she is the one that has started peeing...*sigh* I came out to buy some for this reason. I buy it with complete confidence...would never even entertain the idea of buying anything else.One thing you HAVE to know is that when you apply this to the area, the smell gets worse before it get's better. It wont last long like that, (24-36 hours?) but it is true. You need to keep your cats away until it is fully dried.I soak the area and the area immediately around it. I do NOT soak it up at with a rag or towel AT ALL. Then I just let the enzymes to the work. The enzymes break down the urine to completely get rid of color and odor.You won't regret it...",dogs,3
"I bought my Cat Genie a cpl years ago. The fact that you don't have to scoop poop is fantastic. However, when the unit isn't working properly it is a stinky, gross mess!!! I had a lot of issues with my first unit, so they shipped me a new processing unit. That fixed ""error"" messages that kept beeping. Then the problem became ""the smell"". When the unit dries the granules, there is a horrendous odor!!! So, I bought the ""maintenance pack"". This was supposed to take care of this problem. For the most part it did work. Now, my unit keeps doing the 3 beep error code. Every time it runs. It has run the complete cycle but every time it's BEEP BEEP BEEP!!! I don't want to use my cell minutes sitting on hold, so I email customer service and ask them to call me. No response. A week later I try again. This time I get an email telling me to call customer service. So, I email again and am told that the system won't allow you to stay on hold for very long and the system will take my information and someone will call me back. Why can't someone just call me? Frustrated as hell!!!!! Am I asking for that much?!?!?!?! I am thinking of going back to a regular litter box. If I do go back I will have some boxes of granules and the solution(non-scented) to sell.",cats,2

"Both of my dogs love these bars. They smell good too - like apples. Wellness has a reputation for using quality ingredients, and the ingredient list for these bars is no exception.Eating these bars made one of my dogs itch, though.

"Our 4 year old rat terrier LOVES this toy! We've had it for about a week and I literally have to hide it because he will not stop playing with it otherwise - to the point where he looks like he's going to pass out from exhaustion. Even once it's hidden, he keeps returning to the room it's in and staring longingly at the shelf. Poor thing!The only negative I would point out is that the ball is made from a hard plastic, which I am assuming is to protect the electronics inside. Our dog immediately started gnawing on it and, upon closer inspection, the package does indicate that it IS NOT chew toy and suggests putting the ball into an old sock so the dog isn't tempted to chew it. Our dog still loves playing with it, but I've already gone through two socks, so I am not sure how great a solution that is...I am also planning to buy a larger size that will be harder for him to get his mouth around. Hopefully, that won't take all the fun out of it for him though!",dogs,3

She is almost 18 yrs. old & I was feeling bad every time she'd go there because I know she's not going outside as much in the winter, because it's cold & it's not warm downstairs. Anyway, I had been looking for something like this in the local stores with no luck. I checked around on line & found this. She took to it in a few hours. For her, that was great because she's a lot like a person, set in their ways. I was thrilled. We are both very happy for this product. Thank you!",cats,2
"The collar works flawlessly for my dogs. It takes about a week for the dog to figure out that the collar is watching them at all times. Just put it on when you know they'll bark and watch it work.Notes:If you leave the collar on while they're outside, take any tags off the main collor. If they knock up against the housing, your poor dog will be punished when they hit the housing hard enough.Battery wears off quickly after a heavy barker uses it for awhile. This is the only reason for the 4/5 stars.As for the other review saying it doesn't work, they have 2 options. 1, knock it up against something while holding the prongs to figure out if its really working or if the LED is just going off. I'm a firm believer in trying something out on myself before I use it on my dogs. If you get shocked, you understand how much it can hurt. If you don't, you know its not working.I have a feeling the 2nd option is the real issue with them... Trim the hair back on long-haired breeds and TIGHTEN the collar down. If its not connecting on both sides, its not going to work folks.I use this on a Lab/Germ Shep mix and a Jack Russel mix and as long as you tighten the collar right, it works flawlessly.",dogs,3

This crate was a great buy and good price. I love the double doors on it. I did make a modification right away when setting it up. The side door would have faced the wall for the location where it went so I undid the bottom hooks on the side panels and switched the two panels. The front and top are all connected and can't be taken apart but the sides switched in less than 5 minutes with only a few tools to help out. It is not intended to be taken apart and is very sturdy but I was happy that I was able to get both doors in an accessible area in a few minutes. The training piece was a nice addition too. It all set up very quickly. I would recommend this to others.,dogs,3
"My two cats have gotte into the habbit of waking me up at 4:30 - 5:00 am by meowing and knocking things off of my desk. This all started when I had to reduce their food intake because the vet said they were both getting a little pudgy. After researching an automatic feeder, which cost upwards of $50, I finally decided to give the PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball.I ordered two of them and started with the holes as wide as they would get. This allowed the food to easily come out with minimal effort from the cats. It took a few days but they eventually figured it out (I also stopped putting food in their bowl so they had no choice if they wanted to eat). After a week or two I started closing the holes so it now takes them longer to eat. I feed them 3 times a day, with the last time being right before I go to bed (around 10). No more kitties waking me up!",cats,2
My 4 month old Morkie puppy loved the taste of this but it only lasted about 1/2 hour. The product didn't say it was for a puppy but I thought I'd try it to see if it would be good for her teething. I was sure hoping it would last a little longer so don't know if I'll be buying them again. She did enjoy that 1/2 hour so at least it wasn't a total waste of money. Don't know how the description can say it is long lasting though. I do like that it is more natural than nylabones just wish it lasted longer.,dogs,3
"I bought this for my dog several years ago and when she finally wore out the squirrels I bought another just because of the hours of sheer joy this gave her.

This is, by far, her favorite toy and I highly recommend it.",dogs,3

"I read a few reviews of this product before purchasing, which claimed that this product worked wonders and had no odor. Since I was about to spread an airborne cat hormone product into my household, that was my main concern, closely followed by mentions that it had aggravated some allergies at the same time.Well, it didn't have an odor. And, thank goodness, it did not make my husband's allergies worse. Of course, it also didn't work.Very simple to use, just unscrew the cap, screw onto the diffuser, plug in and leave. It claims to last four weeks, but mine lasted two. Also, because of the size of the diffuser, you can't plug it into the top of the duplex and expect to use the bottom of the duplex with another plug; you also can't plug it in the bottom and use a plug on top unless you don't care about the other plug getting really greasy with cat phermones. Ick. After just two hours of plugging something else in, it was about ready to drip... probably not great since liquid + electricity doesn't usually end well. We did have a piece of furniture just six inches from the product and did not have any problems with the Feliway being greasy on it.Now about it not working... our cat has had separation anxiety since my husband stopped working from home. She peed on the couch regularly (among other places), about once in the morning, once at night, and sometimes another time or two just for fun. Don't be fooled - she has a litter box and does use it occasionally when she feels like it, and she knows when she had done wrong because she will slink through the house and we go on red alert to find the latest stain.The day after we plugged it in, I noted that she peed three times on the furniture. The next day was four. Then back to three. This continued for the next few weeks, with some pooping on the floor as well. But still once in a while in the box, just to prove she was doing it on purpose. I'd have to say that it was totally unsuccessful.",cats,2

"The dog seems to enjoy chewing on this toy and it looks like it will have a hard time trying to destroy it. While I'm happy with the quality of the product, I think there isn't a big difference between the Large and the X-Large when it comes to their dimensions. The only noticeable difference is in the prices. The same goes for the Small and Medium sizes. So if you're not sure what size to choose then I recommend that you pick from the Large or Small since they're not noticeably different from the more expensive bigger sizes.",dogs,3
"The product itself is a decent design and the rake picks up well after my boxer. The only gripe I have is that the wooden handles are made out of very cheap material.

I like the product, wish the material was more sturdy, and wish it had longer handles. Use with care.",dogs,3

If she needs to take off after a squirrel and I haven't sped up fast enough to distract her, the plastic disk breaks off and we're both saved from crashing. Of course you have to be vigilant about traffic, other dogs, etc., but it's a great way to give the dog more exercise when you don't feel like getting exhausted yourself. I highly recommend the Springer and was disappointed to learn that my local bike shop stopped carrying it. Thank heaven for the internet!",dogs,3
We had one of these for our Jack Russell (Rustam) and our Aussi Cattle dog (Paro) would wait for him to step out at night and get in it to go to sleep. This made Rustam come to our bed. Today night we had 2 crates and we all slept happily. I like that this crate has 3 doors in case we want to move them around there are many possibilities. I like the fact that we can remove the doors so we are not hitting it or knocking then shut. We don't lock the crates till we have someone who is really scared of dogs over or are using the vacuum cleaner the crate works fine for both the situations to hold them in. But then our dogs don't try to breakout.,dogs,3

So basically I have a back up for the one used in the cellar if something should go wrong with it. Highly recommended.,cats,2

"This really does work the way it advertises. It was really hard to close the top over the bottom but once accomplished, the box does roll easily. Best results when the cat litter is not too deep and roll slowly. You will hear the chunks hit but if you roll too far, you will also get some clean sand in the trap. Easy to pull out the trap handle and replace. You need some room to roll the box so if your bathroom is tight, try the laundry room.",cats,2

When enticed by a fleeing squirrel or bunny, my 25 lb. border collie mix (Lucy) would occasionally run through the shock fence and jump over the chain link fence. Lucy hasn't left my yard since I installed the wireless fence a month ago. The fact that she can no longer dash through the shock field but keeps getting shocked until she returns has made a huge difference. I had read some customer reviews of the wireless system that mentioned unexpected collar activations inside the house. I had experienced this problem with my old buried wire system. With that system, the collar would beep occasionally when my dogs got close to TVs or computers. My dogs have, consequently, been scared of TVs for years. Now that I've used the wireless system for about a month, the dogs will actually sit with me when I'm watching TV. Hurray!",dogs,3

In short, they make a usually painful experience manageable. This product fills that roll very nicely, and the price on Amazon beats pet stores by a lot.The negative aspect is that (even with proper training and acclimation) dogs universally hate having stuff on their face. You need to be really careful about introducing this to your dog (training ideas are included), but your dog still won't like it. My dog used to spend a long time unsuccesfully swatting at his face, sliding his face across the ground, or shoving his face in people's crotches because he hates having the thing on his face.However, this is the only solution that I have found that is non-violent, practical, and effective.",dogs,3

"This product is fabulous! I highly recommend this product to any dog owner, especially if they have a puppy who is still potty training. My puppy was creating havoc when I just let him run loose through my apartment. He'd find favorite areas to relieve himself, so my roommate and I were constantly having to watch him. With the pen, we can confine him when we're gone at work and even when we're home and can't attend to him..such as while cooking, cleaning, etc. This pen is so versatile. We've used it as a rectangular shape, octagon shape, and just as a fence. It gives your pup a lot of room to sleep, eat, drink, and even relieve himself on a puppy pad if need be. And it is portable too! You simply fold it up, secure it with the provided hook and carry it wherever you need to with the handle. It is high enough as well that even when my puppy is full grown, there's no way he could jump over it. (He's a cocker spaniel/bichon frise mix). And YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE!!! For something similar and usually smaller at a pet store, you'll pay at least $20 more. This product has relieved so much stress in my home. My roommate and I love it and our cockerchon loves it as well!!! Thank you GOGO!!!!",dogs,3
"You would think such a large brand should be trusted; that they made money by making a healthy product for dogs. Well, let me not even say what effects this dog food had on my dog--let me just show the beginning of the ingredients list from the [...] website as of the date of this review (Check there yourself if you don't trust me):Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitolCorn and corn gluten and rice flour are not exactly wonderful, but--SUGAR and SORBITOL! Sorbitol, that nasty stuff in gum that gives people gas and loose stools! Can you wonder why your dog stinks up the house if it's eating this crap? And sugar! Need I even say why that is bad, or what health problems that can lead to? My vet sure got on a soapbox over the dangers of sugar, and rightly so. And even the ""healthy weight"" stuff has sugar and sorbitol in it!Don't buy Beneful for your dog. Pay careful attention to the entire ingredients list of the dog food you DO buy, as a lot of brands sure don't think you care about whether your dog lives many years or has expensive vet bills as long as it scarfs down their corner-cutting product. And if you must buy Beneful, at least send the company a few angry letters telling them to take the sugar and fake sweeteners out so you no longer have to feel you're killing your dog. I mean, come on, they could use apple juice if they wanted a sweetener. This is incredibly unhealthy and reprehensible, if you ask me. I sure won't buy this dog food ever again, and I would think twice before trusting Purina.",dogs,3

"I originally purchased this item in Sept 2010. I have 3 dogs so I ordered 3 bottles. We use a 3 gallon water dispenser so I had to do a little math to calculate how much was needed for 3 gals of water. Our dogs are small coming in at 7, 10 and 12 pounds respectively, so their water lasts 7-10 days.I purchased this because our ""middle child"", Cupid had started acting weird. He would turn his head to either side and do a combo growl/bark that we are calling a yap. It was like he was talking to himself and then answering himself. it was very odd and made me wonder if dogs could be schizophrenic! We got some anxiet medication from the vet, but I don't think they did much. We had moved in August so they no longer had the huge yard they were used too, only a small courtyard. We figured the stress of moving and not being able to run around whenever he felt like it were causing him some stress as well as the other kids.These last couple of months he has been yappy again. Barking at every leak falling down, ""yelling"" at us, ""talking"" all the time. It is really starting to wear on our nerves and my husband suggested taking him back to the vet again. Then we were in the car coming home from the dog park and since he's been handling filling their water dispenser since I hurt my back a few months ago, I asked him if was putting the right amount in their water and his response was that he ran out of that stuff a couple months ago and haven't been using it.So, here I am, ordering 3 more bottles, because it was obviously working during the months he was drinking it and the only that has changed in 2011 is that he is no longer drinking it![...]",dogs,3

They will not get bent or stop flying correctly even after repeated use. I take my border collie mix to frisbee competitions and these are the only discs people use, even those who own pit bulls.

"I'm usually suspicious about bringing home a toy before my dog checks it out in person. Usually at petsmart, I'll let her go along in the isles and pick something off the shelf. If she plays with it like she's at home, it's usually a keeper. If it's something I pick out randomly, it's torn into pieces by the end of the first night. Most of the kong toys don't even last!This particular toy seemed a little more like her style. Though the first few days, she paid little next to no attention to it. She used it as a chin rest. I've recently started a new job and she's adjusting to the new schedule as well as I am. A few days later, she picked up the platypus and realized there was multiple squeaky's in it. Once she opened up the belly, she took out the plushes. She played with them like the tennis ball, which was to my surprise. However, the platypus got a little mangled, what she does with toys that have stuffing in it, she rips out the stuffing first, then the starts ripping off the legs and other parts...she gets really excited when she hears the tear. So after she pulled off a foot successfully, I went ahead and restuffed the platypus and she had that look on her face like ""what no, i just pulled that stuff out!"" and she went ahead and picked out the eggs. It takes her less then 10 mins to do so, but at least she likes the toy now. I'm hoping she will do the same as she does with her treat kong toy, she throws it at me when she wants it refilled. So will see, the toy is alive after one week, which is impressive considering I picked the toy without her lol.Thanks!",dogs,3

I use it on cats and a few long hair breeds of dogs (Shiba Inu, Flat-coated Retriever/Border Collie mix, and Corgi/Aussie mix, Chow mix). It works great for all these animals and the fur comes out much quicker than a regular brush or wire brush. You can clearly see a difference in the coat afterwards.

"This collar made my one year old border collie into a new dog. Not only did it completely eliminate pulling within 5 minutes of fitting, but it also calmed him to the point that he had a much easier time with training. It seems to me to be a bit like a young child. He could overpower me and so thought he was in charge and I was constantly fighting for leader position, so he was always wild and hyper. Once I started using the collar, he realized that I am in charge and calmed down. Contrary to some other posts, I feel like it did help us,to a degree, even when off leash. Back to my thought about a young child, once they know where the limits are and who is really in charge (the adult or human), they are much happier.Like the other posts, I cannot over emphasize the importance of fitting it correctly. I had one of the trainers who teaches our obedience class, and is a gentle leader user, help me fit it.",dogs,3
"I bought these thinking they would be a slightly more productive treat for my 6yo, small, male cat. Usually I give him little pieces of plain fish or chicken, but was happy that there was something that might lessen how often I brush his teeth (since he hates it with a furry passion!).I gave him one thinking if he liked it I would give him more, but didn't want to confuse his system. After about 3 minutes, he threw up everywhere. More than once. I didn't want him to be sick, but he was so excited and had gobbled it up so fast I thought I would try the other flavor. Same thing after only one greenie. He's an EXTREMELY healthy cat, very active and has never had a single health problem, but these made him so sick. After he threw up he wouldn't eat for two days. I was going to take him to the vet, but he perked back up, and started eating normally (hasn't thrown up once since).Obviously it's not like this for every cat, but I looked into it further and if you read reviews from other major sellers there are many problems like this in perfectly healthy cats. Some reacted even worse than mine, so I was lucky.",cats,2

"Our outdoor cat loves this product. Placed a heated bed in it. The Petsafe Wellness Heated Bed (mini) is a perfect fit. This product is not weatherproof, and should be used on a covered porch. The top is wood slats with very small gaps, and water would leak right thru to the interior. I put the cat's food on top, but not the water, as a spill would go right to his bed inside. Top is only removable if you do not use the screws and attach the top.",dogs,3
"I got this litter box because I hate cleaning the litter boxes, but I didn't want to drop $300 on a more expensive self-cleaning box. I have 3 cats and always had two litter boxes, one of which always leaked (even when I replaced it). Anyway, I usually scooped once a week, and it was such a chore! So I bought this and got rid of my two regular boxes. So far, so good! It's ingeniously designed (there's a grate so when you roll it to the right [and you do have to roll it practically upside down], the litter goes into a reservoir and the clumps spill over the top of the grate and into the drawer; when you straighten it out and tip it slightly to the left, the litter goes back through the grate and into the pan). Usually some clumps are left after a rotation, but generally speaking, it's super easy to roll the box and empty the drawer. I do it once or twice a day because it's so easy, which means my house smells way better than usual (since before I was only scooping once a week or so). In short, I recommend this litter box!",cats,2
"...but did not work well for my 12 year old, 40 lb. mixed terrier. She was too afraid to use the steps because of the instability and slippery footing under her feet. These stairs do come with adhesive pads to place on the steps, but they do not seem to add to the comfort of the steps or aid in decreasing the possibility of skidding. When I did try to coax (force) her to use the steps, they jostled around so much that they frightened her even more. I will keep these steps, in case we ever get a smaller dog or another dog in the family needs them, however they do not seem like they would work for a medium-sized dog. I did like the ability to fold the steps, which makes for easy storage.",dogs,3
This is a fun toy for our big dogs that LOVE to chew. They are extremely destructive and this is the first toy they haven't torn apart within a couple hours. We've had it for over a month and it's in great shape still. I do have to get them interested in it by starting a game of tug-o-war because it doesn't really bouce but it's a nice change from a ball and easy to clean.,dogs,3
great collar and wonderful color! the stitching is very solid and the material has a great weight. concerned the clasp won't hold up but it has so far (this is a late review. i bought it about 2 months ago). made in the u.s.a. as well! i can safely recommend sandia pet products.,cats,2

"I ordered this product out of curiousity and because of all the positive reviews. My cat would sometimes eat our plants or our neighbors' plants so I thought this product would stop her from doing that. However, whenever she'd eaten a plant, my cat would always end up throwing it up because she couldn't digest it. I thought that she would be able eat and digest this product since it's ""pet greens garden wheat grass."" I had no problem with the growing of the grass. Actually, it grew beautifully (took about 5 days to really start growing out of the bag). However, my cat cannot digest this grass either. Multiple times now she has eaten some grass only to throw it up about 5 mins later. I am somewhat disappointed in the product.",cats,2
"This toy has been a favorite! One of our siamese cats that has a chewing fixation. He will chew (and sometimes eat) almost anything sisal, plastic, wood, rope or string, feather, and many fabrics. And power cords. Sometimes I buy him dog toys because they are sturdier! This brand of toys in particular holds his interest, and I like the quality. He has never tried or been able to destroy them, even though he plays with them all the time. My two other cats also like this toy. This is a brand I can always count on to entertain and last.",cats,2
"I received these really fast and boy did I set them right up and got rid of the others that did not have a lid. I get less litter all around them.

I had to take off the front door to them, I will see if they will use it with one of them on. For the price they are great..",cats,2

My cats had scratched MANY holes after just the first use and now I'm going to have a big mess to clean when I need to change out the litter.

"I have had cats for almost 25 years(!) and have used many scratching posts in that time. Most of them are too short, too fragile, or get knocked over a lot due to the small base. That is not a problem with this post.The height is perfect. All of the cats can stretch out completely. Because of this, they seem to use the post more, use it more enthusiastically, and really get into it. Because of the height of the post, along with the base, the cats can unleash the full fury of their adorable furry spite and the post doesn't move or fall over. Rarely does a day go by when one of the cats doesn't run up to the post, begin scratching furiously, and giving me a look that seems to imply, ""You're next, pal.""The base is large, and square. Most of the scratching posts in the house are lying on their sides because the bases are small and/or round. Anything more than a light scratching and they are done for because they aren't really built to be pulled on sideways, they are just built to stand up. That isn't a problem with this post. Again, because of the height and weight of this post, the cats can stretch out and pull down, rather than out.The product is sturdy. We were going through scratching posts so frequently that folks at Petco knew our names. Since we started buying this post, now we are simply 'those weird people who buy all the Feline Pine'(another great product - just do it!). I have bought 5 of these in the past two years, three for me and two as gifts. All of them are still in service, the oldest and most frequently used still looks great and shows only a little wear on the scratching surface.Finally, many scratching posts have a lot of staples in them. I was quite alarmed recently when I realized that all the staples I have been finding on the floor came from one of our pet store scratching posts which, having been thoroughly abused, was shedding sessile, carpeting, and the hundreds of staples apparently used to hold everything together. This product doesn't appear to contain anything designed to harm your cat.I heartily recommend this product. It may not be the first scratching post you buy, but it will probably be the last.",cats,2
"I am disabled and at first I was pleased with this machine. It worked fine for about the first month then the clogs and the stench started. No matter what I did from scrubbing with lysol to cleaning once a week the cat genie had a horrible smell to it. The plastic harbors the smell and you can't get rid of it. The granuals also hold the smell in. Ya it washes everyday and when it is drying your house smells like Cat Crap soup with a Perfumy cover. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It will leave your pocket book broken, your nose smitten and you house guest going OMG what is that smell.",cats,2
"I decided to turn my Biube into a nano reef tank. First, I pretty much gutted everything out including the filter, air pump, and and the tube the bubbles ride in. In order for this to work without the filtration unit, lots of live sand and live rock need to be added. I added 20 lbs of live sand, and 18 pounds of live rock to the biube. I then stuck a powerhead and a small heater behind the live rock in the back ( my tank sits in a corner). Last I purcahsed a Coralife Nano lighting unit with daylight & antinic bulbs. I cut and modified the top a little to get more light in the tank with the new lightning unit. I did not add a protein skimmer, so a 20% water change should be done every two weeks. I Got a good clean-up crew, and it was good to go. I love the way the live rock, and fish look in this tank. I like the biube alot and may purchase another.",fish aquatic pets,4

My dog needs 12"" from the beginning of the leather to the hole. Amazon took care of me though, so i'm a very satisfied consumer.",dogs,3

It's a little hard for my 50 LBS Aussie to get underneath the disc so he often times gets a grip on the cloth in the center of the disc (where you see the logo in the picture). As a result, we're starting to see some holes and tears after about 1.5 months of almost daily use. We put it up and out of his reach when we're not playing with it because if he uses it as a chew toy, it'll be destroyed in a day. Overall, I'd buy another when this one goes.

Currently we're using a red heat lamp, but the light isn't desirable past a couple of weeks. I was looking at a ceramic bulb, but found this for less money. The downside was that there was absolutely 0 information on the net to tell me if this would work for what I wanted it for or not.Well, I'm going to go ahead and be the first.

"As a former dog groomer I'm used to the Oster A5 clippers, which are great. At this time however, I wasn't prepared to pay for the Oster so I checked reviews and thought that the Andis clippers would be a good alternative. I have 2 small dogs, a terrier mix and a Heinz 57 with a very thick undercoat. The ceramic #10 blade it comes with does stay cool for much longer than the non ceramic. The blade guards it comes with, are great for the terriers thin coat and would be good for normal haircutting. For my other dog, well, the undercoat is to much for the blade guards. I have gotten through it, but it takes entirely to long. It's going to take another actual blade to do the work. Probably a #4 or #5 blade.The clippers seem to be well made. I didn't notice them getting hot after the 1-1/2 hours of constant use. I think that they were a good choice. It'll be interesting to see how long they last. With only being used twice a month, once on the 2 dogs and once on my husband. Hopefully it'll be quite a while before I have to worry about replacing them.",dogs,3
"This product has helped a lot. My cat's crazy making behavior calmed down within a day or two to very tolerable levels, although I did eventually combine Feliway with Calming Chews by Pet Naturals of Vermont to get completely satisfactory results. I can't change the things causing my cat's anxiety right now and am relieved I can rely on Feliway to help us out until I can.Although I can't smell the Feliway at all, I am sure Feliway is working because there was definite improvement when it was introduced plus my cat started hanging out exclusively near the diffuser, abandoning her usual chill out spots in order to do so. After a couple of weeks, I decided to see if I could cut back to just the Feliway. After a peeing incident we are back to the Feliway plus Calming Chews again. No issue since. I reverse tested to see I could eliminate the Feliway and rely on just the Calming Chews. There was soon an obvious uptick in annoying behaviors. Seems the best combination for us is Feliway plus the Chews.You do need to consider factors like air circulation as well as the volume of air the diffuser has to treat. Putting it in too large a space, a room with high ceilings or circulation issues caused by objects like furniture or screens blocking air flow will blunt its ability to treat the entire space. Open plan homes may also cause probs since there is no way to confine the pheromones to a specific area. In some cases the spray may be more practical.If you're not completely happy with Feliway alone, before giving up on it completely try tweaks like changing the diffuser's location; using more than one diffuser; supplementing with the spray in places the diffuser might not reach; using a calming collar in addition; or, like us, adding anti-anxiety supplements like Calming Chews. If none of these things help, then you likely need to make changes in the cat's circumstances or environment.Just read the review by Susan A. Mascia warning about high ethylene content in Feliway, which she says is harmful to humans. I have not noticed any problems at all but tolerance levels vary greatly from person to person for all sorts of substances.I am hoping my cat's anxiety level will eventually reset itself to normal so I no longer need these expensive products. But even if we have to continue them indefinitely, that is preferable to surrendering her to a no-kill pound, which unfortunately would have been the next step.",cats,2

I didn't order this off of Amazon but I did get it at my local Walmart. I recently just moved into an apartment complex so and where I didn't have a job just yet I bought this product to put on my cat so he wouldn't get fleas. I've owned my cat for ten years and never once has he had a flea. I moved into this place and three months after using this product I find a flea on my poor baby. The first time I applied this product I thought I applied it wrong because my cat was still able to get at it and try to lick it off. It caused him to froth at the mouth so I was forced to wash it all off (he sure didn't like that). I called my Vet today because I need information on fleas. My Vet told me I shouldn't be using this product because it doesn't get rid of fleas at all. She didn't say it was harmful but obviously it is. I did apply it to my cat today not reading the reviews until now. He's doing fine but that's just probably because he's a big boy (16lbs). I'm going to my vet tomorrow to get the recommended flea fix.,cats,2

"I tried this because Amazon was out of my usual rabbit bedding and it had pretty good reviews. Maybe it works better for smaller animals or if your rabbit is litter box trained so you don't have to line the entire cage with this bedding but it just doesn't work for my bunny. This stuff is so light that it is now all over the place because every time the rabbit moves, he kicks some into the air and it flies out of the cage. Plus, it gets stuck in his fur (and he's not a long-haired rabbit so it shouldn't be an issue.) I have to do whole cage changes much more frequently than I did before and the economical aspect of it is now a negative because I'd like to order my other brand but now I have ALL of this other bedding to use up! There are better options out there (I personally can't seem to find anything that works as well as Kritter Krumbles Coconut bedding.) Again, it might be perfect for smaller animals that can't kick it everywhere but not for my regular-sized bunny (not a dwarf or a giant; I can only imagine how far this would have traveled kicked by my old Flemish Giant!)

This toy doesn't even have teeth marks in it yet! Today was also the first snow for the midwest and it was a great snow toy. It gets stuck just below the surface so the dog has to dig and look for it a little bit, but the color and density make it really easy to find if the dog can't (only happened 2 times in half hour of extreme fetch).

It is soft but doesn't have the sherpa texture.Also, the bed comes in a box (from Majestic) folded in half. It took a couple of days for it to lay properly. I agree that this bed is very light weight. I am using it for 2 dogs that are each under 20 lb. Therefore, it is sturdy enough for them. I would not recommend it for a 50 lb. dog.",dogs,3
"I recieved one headband that consisted of one strap with heavy duty Velcro on it that is about 1/2 inch thick. After I laid down, the thickness was annoying and then it slipped off my head every move because it does not include a secondary strap around your skull. The next morning a sewed an addition strap to it to keep it in place. That solved the slipping problem but still to thick. Threw it in the trash.",dogs,3
"This was recommended to me for my rambunctious pitbull who pulls me more than I pull him. It did make waking him much easier but in turn it rubbed his skin raw and he has bruises.

"This product came in perfect condition, and in a timely manner which i loved! However it is very confusing trying to strap it onto the console...I basically gave up trying to strap it in and it seems to be squished between the two seats well enough that it doesnt move too much.

"I got this collar because we had a reflective braided leash (that we got from Walmart) that was the best leash we've ever tried and I thought this reflective braided collar would be great too (even though it wasn't from the same company). However, this collar also has an unbraided portion, which is the weakest link in this case. The braided part is strong enough (although not as strong as the Walmart leash we had) but beyond that, the unbraided portion was flimsy. Not only would the end of the collar beyond the buckle keep slipping out, but the rings on the unbraided portion would break off and that portion would start to fray, so we had to replace it because the collar was slipping off every time our dog pulled hard on it when leashed.I could see this collar lasting longer for a small dog, but we have a strong 60-lb dog that will pull against the leash sometimes and this collar just couldn't withstand that.",dogs,3
"When our Littermaid unit wore out and died, I did some research on line and decided to try the Scoop Free box. We have had it now for 3-4 weeks and so far it is working just as advertised. It is better than Littermaid and quieter. There is almost no tracking of litter around the house.",cats,2

"As a cat owner for over 20 years, I've definitely had to deal with instances of cats peeing inappropriately. One of my cats had a medical issue that caused him to go outside the box briefly, and I have another who sprays if he is under extra stress (we just took a short vacation and came home to a few spots). Over the years I've tried many different products, and this is the one I prefer. It gets rid of the smell without leaving an annoying scent in its place (it smells like soap me). Also, the concentrate makes it a better buy than a few other products that do work but are more expensive. One bottle of concentrate has lasted me up to a year. I highly recommend this!",cats,2

"I ordered 2 of these and they came today. One was for my Border Collie, and one was for my English Bulldog.Now, don't get me wrong, the dogs loved them, especially my Border Collie.

And I realize that I can order more squirrels, but I can see where this cold turn out to be pricey.I'll give kudos for a toy that dogs love, but the squirrels are not durable and rip apart in minutes.

"I don't really understand what it is about this toy, but he LOVES it! Caries it around, drops it on my lap or at my feet and yowls at me until I play with it. It is waiting for me at the door when I return home, and as soon as I pick it up, he makes his funny ""scritchy"" noise that he makes when he sees birds at the bird feeder outside the window. Have a regular wand with a bunch of ribbons on the end. He will do more jumping with that, but much prefers this one. Stalking it as much as jumping high for it.UPDATE I just discovered a CRAZY NEW TOY that isn't listed under cat toys but check it out - hex bug nano. They are mini robotic critters that skitter just like bugs and drive the cat crazy. Marketed to kids but cats are a natural 2nd audience. Several videos on YouTube also. They have 10 different kinds of bugs that behave in different ways, some remote controlled.

"The PetSafe 5-Meal feeder works very well. It is rather loud when the dish turns and I have it in my bedroom so I definitely hear it at 5:00 a.m. I took a tip from another review and I now feed my cat smaller portions 3 times a day. This has actually kept him satisfied but decreased the total amount of food he is eating. He needs to lose a little bit of weight since he is a very healthy 21-lb boy :) I did have some trouble with the instruction label that is on the inside of the cover. The top left corner was not sticking well and it would impede movement of the bowl at feeding time. I had to rip the label off to stop the problem. I just don't have written instructions now, but other than that I am satisfied.",cats,2
"The Python No Spill Clean & Fill is the best investment I have ever made for the maintenance of my tank!

It has completely solved the problem of having to sweep many times a day.I'm telling all of my cat-owned friends about it.",cats,2
"My cat enjoys most every toy, but amongst the multitude of gifts he received for Christmas this year, this is by far his favorite!

One warning to potential buyers, the balls can be a little noisy when they are being batted around.

I continue to give him one tablet a day and he can run and play for hours with our smaller dog with no signs of lameness.

"I have two cats and travel a lot for my work. I was previously using normal scoopable litter, but as travel increased, this became a problem. My neighbors take care of my cats - stop in to play/feed every day or every other day (I know - the best neighbors ever!!!). I didn't think it was fair to ask them to scoop for me too!!! So I started looking for an automatic litter box. Talked to several people about other systems and problems they had. Bought this at Petsmart - based on their 100% satisfaction policy - they will accept a return even after you use it and decide you don't like it. My first one did stop auto scooping, took it back without a receipt and they replaced no questions asked. Have had no problems since. I buy the cartridges in bulk on line - can't beat Amazons' pricing and customer service! Well worth the increase in price from traditional scoop litter.",cats,2

"This bed is perfect for outdoor barn cats. It is never too warm and warms up only under weight applied to it. When I push down on it with my hand, I can feel it starting to warm up immediately. I have 6 barn cats who love this bed and all snuggle on it on freezing cold nights.It is not plastic junk. It is a quality product. That was very, very important to me because I didn't want to worry about cheap junk burning down our barn as we slept. Also, it is somewhat soft and kinda like an air bed that is not super fat, just a little bit puffy. It is covered with such thick, heavy-duty canvas (and comes with soft fleece cover) that the cats' claws are not going to be able to piece it and pop it- which was also important to me because although it's a large breed dog bed, I wanted it for a cat family. I highly recommend it!",dogs,3

"We bought this heated water bowl so that our outdoor feral cats would have access to water in the wintertime. This is the perfect size for cats as it is small enough for them to drink out of, but large enough that the water doesn't evaporate and empty the bowl too quickly. It has been plugged in for over 3 months straight (and still is plugged in) and still works great. It has survived weeks of subzero temperatures during the night and sometimes throughout the day, too. A little tip is not to fill the bowl all the way because the less water in the bowl, the warmer the water will be. This can help outdoor animals keep a little warmer. The only thing I regret is not buying a second one. I highly recommend this product!!!",dogs,3

"I purchased two of the units two years ago for three cats and am pleased with their operation - WHEN THEY WORK. The cats took to them with no issues and they have made litter control a two minute per week task. The shell and motors are well constructed, but the electronics are of questionable quality, or design. Both units failed last year within a week of each other (either power jack or circuit boards) within the warranty period. To the manufacturer's credit, they were quick to respond to my request for assistance and repaired both units quickly with little effort required on my behalf.One of the units failed again this week; not surprisingly, the culprit was either the power jack or circuit board. In the process of working out a repair. I requested a refurbished replacement unit, since my Litter Robot had been repaired by them less than a year earlier. I was told that the unit was out of warranty (true) and that they would send me parts to replace the faulty components-- they did not indicate that there would be a charge for the parts.This must be a common failure with this product. In both cases, I receive canned trouble shooting instructions, including offers for DYI replacement parts and link to a YouTube video demonstrating the repair. The control panel on the other unit I own does not work properly; the motion sensor and timer seem to function, but pressing the ""cycle"" button does nothing. I have to toggle the power switch to make it run.I will update this review after I fix the units and have a few months of experience with the repairs.",cats,2
"I tried this contraption with my 75 pound golden retriever while training him to heel at my side and I was thoroughly disappointed. It is somewhat restrictive even when not correcting the dog, so it was not ideal for long walks, and I found the corrective action of the device to be substantially less than the more traditional ""spiked"" corrective collars.I ultimately was much more satisfied with the combination of a traditional harness and a corrective collar for occassional corrections, while not fiddling with this thing for 3 miles.",dogs,3

I love this deSheeding Tool. I try to use it outdoors since it takes so much fur off my dogs there is hair all over me and everywhere when I am finished. I just can't believe how much fur it gets out. I try to use the tool in between bushings. It does a wonderful job. I would like to have known how much hair comes off the animal and due to static it gets all over you while your using it. Other than that I love what it does the rest I can cope with.,cats,2
"I was so excited when I bought this toy, imagining the hours my dog would spend entertaining herself with this toy. Unfortunately my mutt took two seconds to size it up and decide that the best way to get the treats out was to chew the rope off, which she did promptly.

"I highly recommend these Jolly Balls (hard plastic balls in various sizes) for Jack Russell Terriers. Ours just loves it -- he kicks it around the yard by himself like a soccer ball. I time him for about 10 to 15 minutes, then put it away, as he would probably drop from playing too much. These are such are great toys for your dog and hold up very well. I usually get in yard to supervise, but he does all the work/play himself. I don't kick it, as its heavy and might injure him or my other Jack. One dog pushes it around the yard, and other dog stays in front of the ball, which must be pretty hard to to do. Both have a great time. I always put it up after playtime. They know when I say Jolly Ball or JB its time to play with this toy. It is a contact sport, given the hard plastic, so be careful, but its tons of fun.",dogs,3

If only this toy could remain as tough as it is, but not end up at the bottom of a pond, lake, or river! In spite of that one defect, they fly so well, so accurately, and so far, and are so exceptionally rugged, they still deserve 5 stars!",dogs,3

"I read the reviews and they seemed to hype this toy up. A lot. But I have one dog that loves soft cuddly toys and friends that have dogs too, so for Christmas I bought one for our household and one for my friends' dogs.The moment my dogs opened this on Christmas (yes I wrapped it for them and yes they opened it) they were in LOVE with this thing! Both of them!!! It was like corgi crack! I've never seen them love a soft toys this much. In fact, my girl corgi was so obsessed with it she wouldn't let her brother play with it.

What a change! My dog is very energetic, constantly sniffing and pulling. We've tried several types of collars and tactics to stop or at least contain the behavior. Nothing seemed to work and walks were more work than pleasure. After fitting this collar we went for a short walk to try it out. Within literally 100 feet he was no longer pulling. By the end of the walk he was staying right beside me. You can use one or two fingers on the leash and the dog will respond.All I can say is, just buy it.",dogs,3

"I have been using this fountain for about a year now, and I love it! I actually use it for the cats and replacement filter cartridges are a must! My household caters to 3 felines, 2 of which are religious users of the fountain. Also, the 2 year old likes to play in it when he gets a chance so I definitely feel better knowing that the water is as clean as I can keep it realistically.I replace the carbon cartridge about every 2 months, rinsing it every week when I clean the fountain completely. Carbon lifespan depends on the amount and quality of water pushed through it (you learn this if you are a fish tank hobbyist), therefore, I only fill the dome about half-way to make the carbon not have to pull as much out of the water. Doing this and a very thorough cleaning of the fountain, the filters seem to be effective longer than one might expect. If I was filling the dome completely full every week, I would change the cartridge every month.This is an absolutely fabulous price for two replacement carbon cartridges, thanks Amazon!",cats,2
Bought the Flexrake standard scoop/spade 2-1/2 months ago to replace a similar set with wood handles that had rotted through.

After all, it is a fountain!I'm starting to get used to the sound. If you put it on a rubber mat, it won't vibrate so much. Not that it is terribly loud, but it is noticeable.",cats,2
"This is the most amazing pet grooming product I have ever used! I have a german shepherd and 2 cats. I got about 20 times more hair using this brush compared to your basic wire brissle brush..... within the first 10 minutes of brushing! When brushing my shepherd I was amazed at the amount of hair that kept coming out, especially on the rump area. He went from a shaggy looking shepherd (keep in mind I brushed him everyday with the other brush), to a sleek handsome boy! The difference was astounding.I dont normally brush my cats, because they are still very young, but I was amazed at the amount of hair I got out of them too! This will help with hairballs, AND the hair around the house. They absolutely love the way it feels too.My shepherd looked great after I got done using this. Not only does it pull out all the dead hair from the undercoat, but it helps evenly distribute the natural oils from their skin. This makes the fur glossy and healthy.I plan on using this before bath time as well, as I'm sure it will help get him more clean without all that dead hair acting as a barrier between the skin and soapy water.I will never use any other type of grooming brush for my animals! THANK YOU FURMINATOR!",cats,2

"I have a Westie mix who is prone to anxiety barking when I leave him alone. These symptoms intensified when we moved. Couple this with a cranky neighbor and I was beyond myself with stress. I hated to even leave the house!I actually bought two of these and wanted to share with you what I think went wrong with the first one since some reviewers are having problems with it not working. I had the first one for about a week. Everything was great--the results were immediate. And then, suddenly, it stopped working. Of course I no longer had the receipt, so I couldn't return it to the pet shop where I bought it (btw, do purchase it online because at a pet store it costs almost twice as much). Out of desperation, I decided to try again with another one. When I was filling it, some spray was coming out, making me think that it was full. But then I saw in the directions that you cannot overfill it and, when more pressure was applied, the citronella spray didn't sputter out. On a whim I went back to the old one, which I still had. Sure enough, I filled it as per the instructions and it worked. Basically, I wasn't putting enough spray in when I thought I was overfilling it.Also, for those worried about whether this causes stress for the dog, I can tell you that in my case I think it really lessened my dog's stress. When I left him alone he would not only bark, but he would also tear the place apart, getting into trash cans, etc. I think the collar really helps because it gets his attention and stops him from working himself up into a frenzy. Of course, you still need to exercise your animal and desensitize him to your leaving, but this collar is really a great supplement to that training if you have a constant problem with barking. I couldn't be happier with the results!",dogs,3
"These batteries are application specific for various petsafe products. They are easy to install and function as expected. The batteries seem to last about 2 months for my 2 dogs. That means about 12 batteries/yr that I am purchasing and disposing when they are discharged. That is a continuously recurring cost to operate the radio fence for my 2 pets. Amazon seems to have the best price for this product, so that is where I check first when I need them. I have seen the price range from $1.50-$6.00 each. Why can't they make these batteries rechargeable? This would lower the cost of operation and be better for the environment.",cats,2

"Our 7 month old poodle was pretty tangled and this clipper set worked real well on shaving him down.I did not have much success with the attachments for different lengths because they kept getting caught in his hair but with just the clipper we were able to get below the matting. He looks great now, so I am really happy with this product specially since it would of cost just as much if not more to get his haircut by someone else and now I can do it whenever.Thanks!",dogs,3

My Whisper leaks HEAVILY. Will never buy an HOB filter again.I see there are many positive reviews (despite the constant complaining about the noise - why would you give it 5 stars then complain about how loud it is?...because it IS loud). Well good for you. I lost my receipt and can't get a replacement, so I'm out $50.Seriously people, if you're going to keep fish, spend the money and buy a product that's worth it. Don't buy a cheaply made piece of crap like I did.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I purchased this product from PetCo fo considerably more than it's price on Amazon(I was in a bit of a rush, please don't hurt me for not taking the time to find the best price). After owning dogs my entire life, I've been constantly searching for a container that will keep the smell locked up. My two St. Bernards eat very high end dog food, the disadvantage to organics and natural dog foods, they smell very, very strongly. And since I have St Bernards that eat impossible amounts of food, it's silly to buy anything other than (2) 36 pound bags at a time. But, it's been a huge struggle to find a container that is big enough to hold that much food, and also seals completely to lock the smell away so that my whole house doesn't constantly smell lik dog food. This one id the trick. Obviously the amount it will hold depends on the density and size of the food you purchase, but mine (I own the 50 pound size) perfectly fits Two 36 pound backs of Before Grain dog food. Way more than the 50 pounds it says. It's also very durable and just feels like it's high quality. It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Also, the fact that the top screws down nice and secure to keep the food fresh. I just love this thing and it has provided a solution to a problem that I have had for a while. I'm thinking about Switching to the 80 pound version so that I can just have petfooddirect.com ship me all 5 bags once every 2 months to save on shipping costs! I strongly recommend this product.",dogs,3
"It is very useful to put treats (spray millet) in and my two parakeets like to play with it. They also like the bell at the bottom. Looked bigger than I thought, but I didn't really read the dimensions, so that'll be my fault. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone! :)",birds,0
Maybe it depends on when and where you buy it but this is by far the best litter I've ever used! We have 3 cats and you literally can't tell that we have cats.. We also have 1 cat and 1 owner ( me) that have allergies to dust so we need a low dust formula.. This one delivers -low dust and no odor..,cats,2
"This product was a huge waste of time and money. It is poorly designed, and my dogs walked right through it the first time we tried to use it. Big disappointment. I wish I could ask for a refund.",dogs,3
This was a big waste of time and money. I have two sixteen pound cats. I tried it for two months and have gone through 9 cartridges. Cleanup after a week is miserable with crystals everywhere and the machine needing a massive whipe down. I'm going back to the old school way. This system costs about 10 times more to maintain and provides little benefit. If I had one cat around ten pounds in size I think it might work. All others should probably take a pass or just assume they are experimenting.,cats,2
"The shampoo that I previously used on my Dog has been discontinued for over a year (Sebolyt). After repeated failed attempts to acquire that shampoo, I ordered Sebolux . Upon using several other shampoos that made my dog's skin worse or no better (he had raw spots & scabbing), I ordered 3 bottles of the Sebolux. This shampoo has made a big improvement in my Soft coated Wheaten Terrier's skin condition & was also endorsed by my vet. Will continue to order & would like to be able to order in gallon quantities.",cats,2
"My greyhound hates this thing. He wears the Gentle Leader Easy Walk harness with no problems, so I guess this one just doesn't fit his deep chest properly.

"My dog was already trained with a collar I had control over the beep and shock so when that wore out I needed a new solution. This was perfect since it emits a beep before a shock. Since she is already trained a beep after a bark silences her and brings her to me. Does not work for all dogs. My bigger dog is not even phased by a beep/shock solution. Er on a side of caution with these things, definitely not for all dogs.",dogs,3

"The puppy LOVED this toy, it was funny to see her pick it up and have it cover her face, her little nose sticking through the hole in the middle. It is easy to wash and can be thrown in the dryer. It is easily tossed for fetch and wont break anything in the house. It resisted her razor sharp puppy teeth for about two months, then the cloth ripped and the stuffing came out. That's not bad for a cloth toy. I recommend it.",dogs,3
"We have a short hair that is seasonally shedding. I didn't think she would tolerate brushing, but she absolutely loves this brush.

"My Weim/lab mix ate the ENTIRE toy in less than a day. Not worth the money. I was hoping it would last for a week, but less than a day? Get real.",dogs,3
"Maybe it's because he's too big or maybe he's not very smart (I'll never admit that!), but he doesn't get this toy at all. He treats the &#34;stump&#34; as it's own toy, and doesn't try to get the squirrels out. Oh well, he enjoys it nonetheless!",dogs,3
"When we first got our kitten, we had a real big issue with one of our dogs eating her poop. Even constantly watching our dog, he would always sneak off and get a bite. This litter box saved us a lot of headaches and some very stinky breath.We didn't want to use clumping litter in case the dogs ate it, so we are using pressed newspaper litter which disintegrates when wet. We are currently lining the box with 120L Garbage bags (A lot cheaper then buying the liners). Because the bags are pretty deep and the lid keeps it in place, it doesn't shift when our cat paws at the bag. Very little litter ever gets tracked out, it usually end up on the lid.I would recommend this litter box to anyone, especially to people who wants to keep smaller dogs out (not sure if it would work with larger dogs)",cats,2
"I bring my dog to work with me. We are open to the public and he had a very bad habit of barking at everyone that approached the dog pen. My boss was very upset about this and was threatening to not allow him to come anymore. I only use the collar when he is in the pen, it works very well. He only barks once, gets sprayed and immediately stops. I've only been using the collar for about a week and he is already at the point where he doesn't bark at all most of the time, even without being sprayed. I do wish it was waterproof though, that is my one complaint.",dogs,3
Works well and the cat is happy. I would suggest you try this comb as its the real deal. Great price and great product.,cats,2
"Perfect for my needs. I have a 40 lb dog who uses this tie out cable. It seems perfectly sturdy without being excessively heavy. It has not kinked or twisted.I did receive a blue cable in case anyone is concerned about color.Edit on 10 Oct 2012.This cable has rusted and has faded to almost white. I don't use the clip on either end, so it is still working for me since I keep a collar permanently on one end. I'd image if you need to use the clip that the rust would make it difficult.",dogs,3

"I'd had to order and return two different sizes of the same coat from another store before giving in and ordering four different coats to try on our mixed-breed dog. This coat was one of the four and fit the best out of them all (even though I carefully measured and followed the size charts). So, I'd say this coat is very true to size as described!The strap which goes under the belly works very well at holding the coat on, but doesn't get in the way of our male dog's ""equipment"" so he can relieve himself without decorating the coat at the same time.Our pup looks great in this coat, which is well made and appears high-quality.The only negative we've found is that the coat is very crinkly (akin to the sound dog and cat toys make when they have a crinkly part). I believe it must be the thermal lining. It makes enough noise that it confused and startled our pup at first. He eventually learned to ignore it, though.",dogs,3
I purchased this to keep my bunny from chewing... everything! Seems to be working well so far!I realize it is for puppies but it has the same ingredients in bitter apple for small animals but received better reviews... because she hates it so much she won't be ingesting any of it!!!,dogs,3
"I like this product, and it does what all the reviews say it would do. I won't go into the good things because it's already covered in depth. Instead I'll offer a few criticisms:1. I spent about 20 minutes or so brushing each one of my two cats and it seemed like there was no end in sight. Exactly when is enough enough? I could have probably spent hours brushing until my cat was bald if I was determined enough. At least they liked it a lot more than the regular cat brush.2. How often am I supposed to ""de-fur"" them? It seemed like less than a week and my cats were already noticeably shedding again and they're not even long haired or thick coated. This isn't the product's fault, but I guess I was under the impression that the product would solve my problems for a while and that I wouldn't have to go through this ritual again for a while...wrong.3. After I bought this here (the current $18 + shipping price from Amazon is pretty good compared to PetCo), I was at Walmart and saw another product that I can't remember the name of, BUT it looks 95% identical to this one (same handle design and blade quality) and it only costed $14. So I felt a bit disappointed.",cats,2

"Bought it for a stray that comes and goes, but won't come or stay inside. Have used the bowl plugged into an outlet next to basement garage/walk out door, under cover from deck above. The bowl itself seems very sturdily built. I've not seen any issues with any animal chewing on the wire wrapped electric cord - but could see that like anything, if one is driven, anything can happen. It stays plugged in 24x7 and I've noticed on more than 1 occasion with temps in teens\low 20's, it freezes over pretty good on the top - even a large dog would not break it free. But it seems not every time - this morning it's 16, no wind, clear, and it's not frozen; day before it was 19 and frozen over. So, all in all it's a 1000% better than a non-heated bowl, holds a good amount of liquid and I would recommend/buy again.",dogs,3

"This thing pulls hair from places so fast, the first pull will amaze you. Go ahead and get your slicker brush out and pull it across your pets fur 10 or 20 times, take that hair pile and set it to the side. Notice how long it takes you to get the hair out of the slicker brush.Now, using the furminator, pull it once or twice, you will get more hair out of it on the first and second times than from all of the pulls you use with the slicker brush.Just get one, you will not be sorry, and if you are, you are probably not easy to please anyways :-)",cats,2
"While it was a bit of a pain to find out the exact wattage of my microwave, the warnings of dire consequences set me searching for the manual. Once I tried it out, it worked very well. It's warm, not hot, when it comes out of the microwave, and stays warm the entire day. My only complaint is that it is rather hard, even with the cover. I have to put a blanket on top of it, then place the dog bed on top of the blanket. Otherwise, my dog won't lay on it.",cats,2
"My dog already had a similar toy (the platypus where the dog takes out the squeaking eggs). It took her a while to figure that one out, but she got the idea of this one almost immediately. I give it to her, she takes out all the balls...I try to stick them back in as fast as she takes them out, so the game lasts a while, and she enjoys it, but it requires my constant input. I'm thinking about stitching up a few of the openings, which might make it a little more challenging.",dogs,3
"I have had this fountain for over 2 years. I love it and so do the 5 cats that use it. Some like to drink from the reservoir, others like drinking from the top of the dome, and another likes to lay down next to it playing with the water as he drinks. Having so many cats it does tend to get dirty, but it is 100% better than the alternative. The filter helps keep most of the dirt and hair from getting recirculated. The instructions suggest you refill the system by refilling the dome - however you quickly learn that you can pour water directly into the reservoir. Cleaning is time consuming since you have to take everything apart - but it's once or twice a month - not a problem. i will never go back to standard water bowls.",cats,2

"Maybe my puppy is just lazy. Got the puppy kong for my 8 wk old puppy and thought that he would love it. Nope, if he cannot get the treat out in under 30 seconds, he loses interest. I have smeared peanut butter on the inside and put some of his kibbles in there. Because the kibbles are stuck to the peanut butter, it doesn't really come out. Instead of chewing and working for the food, he just gives up. If there is no treats in there, he doesn't even play with it. I also think that I underestimated how big he was growing. The puppy size kong doesn't really fit a whole lot of kibbles and also I think his mouth is too big to really get in the kong to get the food out. I've contemplated on getting a classic kong but because of the experience, I do not know whether I really want to spend money on something he may still not care for. So sorry, kong didn't work for my dog.",dogs,3

"I love this litter box.I was a little worried because based on reviews everyone either loved or hated this litter box. Mine arrived and works perfectly. I have always disliked having to get my face next to a litter box to scoop it with the tiny litter scoopers that everyone sells, and electronic litter boxes never seem to work for more than a year according to reviews and cost far more than I want to spend on a litter box. This litter box is a great solution!There are a few small problems with it I will admit. You can't fill the box enough to really allow for burying the way cats like to do. Even with the large box being emptied every day it really doesn't have enough litter for my two cats. As a result when I do empty it I have to hit the bottom of the litter box to get all of the poop off that is stuck to the bottom.",cats,2

I love our Petsafe wireless fence system for the most part. My only hesitation is with the fact that from time to time the collar will beep without a cause that I can recognize.

"Use as regular shampoo. Or to treat dermatitis, or mange by following the instructions on the label; to leave on for an extended 10 minutes. This way it soaks deep into your dogs' hair follicles where mange may be hiding. If it's the lesser threat of dermatitis this will definitely clear it. On my pet, just one 10 minute treatment did the trick. But for more severe cases it may take up to 2 or 3 treatments.",dogs,3

I guess somehow they don't realize that the fleas are actually LIVING ON them, not necessarily in the carpet or on the couch, bed, anything that's not flat and clean. I remember that first treatment after it finally got here. Two of the cats laid out on the couch, and you could actually watch the fleas marching off of them (while they slept for the first time in weeks!) and they would then die.

"I bought the PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box from Amazon about 6 months ago. I loved how quiet it was and my cat didn't have any issues with it. I just didn't like the smell. The urine clumps would break up during the cleaning cycle and leave little bits of all over the clean litter. It started to stink pretty quickly. I only have one cat, he's a big one, but I didn't remember his litter ever smelling so bad. So, I went back and read the reviews on Amazon for this product. I remembered one guy saying that he plugged the litter box into a lamp timer. So, I went to the store and got a cheap timer that you plug your lights in to make it look like you're home when you're on vacation. I have it set to turn on the litter box 4 times a day for 1 hour. That took care of my smell problem. Now my only problem is remembering to empty the bin on a regular basis. It's so quiet I forget it is there.",cats,2

"This treats are really good and my guys love them! We ask the dogs if they want these treats and they go flying over to the bag.

My dog is my life and my husband will agree so when it comes to her health I have no problem spending a little money for her teeth. I do brush her teeth most days but it is good to back it up with the Greenies. If you keep the plaque off your pup's teeth they will have a far more healhy life. This does not replace brushing their teeth but it doesn't hurt. Think of it as mouthwash for doggies.,dogs,3
The price for this pack of 6 Frontline Plus was nothing short of phenomenal. The shipping was great from packaging to delivery. I've certainly bookmarked this vendor.,cats,2

"Maybe I have an unrealistic expectations, but I expect dog toys to last longer than 10 minutes. My 4-year-old Jack Russell pawed it around and understood the treat comes out the bottom part but didn't want to waste time and went right for it. What a waste of money!",dogs,3
"I like this fountain and it certainly does encourage my dog to drink more water. The only reason I do not like it is that it needs to be cleaned fairly frequently or the motor gets plugged with hair even with the new filter. I do not find it hard to clean, so I still think it deserves 4 stars.",cats,2
We have a Rotweiller that sheds not stop. We have tried a curry comb for horses which works okay. But our vet tried the FURminator on our Rot. and what a pile of fur. Our vet. was selling the medium size one for $39.95 plus tax. We purchased the large one for $19.95 received in 5-6 days. Our dog loves it and we really have noticed a difference. It really helps cut the shedding down.,cats,2

"My dog Sadie was getting out every time I let her out in the back yard. I have a 6 foot fence and she would use her teeth and pull the fence and go under it. She is a boxer and is strong. After my nephew installed the unit, Sadie got zapped twice and that was 2 weeks ago. She has not left the yard since and has not even gone close to the fence. While it may sound mean to do that to her, it is much better than her going across the busy highway I live on and getting hit. Or getting lost. I recommend this product to everyone that has a wondering puppy. Also, purchasing this through Amazon was cheaper by almost $150.00. Thank you Amazon.",dogs,3

"We thought we found an indestructable toy for our beagle. Well this lasted about a month before the black material on the end was chewed through enough that we could see the stuffing inside. To be fair our dog was still under a year old at the time , but we found it the other day and tried again, but of course we never repaired it from the initial damage so again had to put it away. If you have a smaller breed dog , or an older dog it may be fine , we were shocked at how durable the material for this was so only exception is for the ends.",dogs,3

"Pro:1. Works.2. Easy to use.3. Easy to set up.4. Shipped fast.5. Cats took right to it.6. Sturdy.7. No door makes it easy to tell if you need to clean it.Cons:1. Requires a space that is twice the size of the product to work.2. Litter mat doesn't seem to collect litter well with this one.3. No door to keep smell out.4. Does not rock as smoothly as I expected.There is only one way I can see to really improve this, and that would be to make a model that works internal of its case. I like keeping the litter in the laundry room, but because the flipping motion requires so much space, I was forced to put it in a spare bathroom. If there was a model that could do the filtering without having to have double the footprint of the product I would replace the one I have.Overall a great product. This is better then the electric cleaners (to noisy) and the shifters (to heavy and easily clogged).",cats,2

"I had already installed a simple Cat Mate door in my wall and it worked fine except, as others have said, the raccoons and skunks got in. I did not want to enlarge the holes in the wall so I mounted the new electromagnetic Cat Mate flush on the inside wall so that only the ""outside"" lip was in the tunnel. I left the existing Cat Mate door on the outside wall. The unit looks great even though it projects a little into the room and the setup works great. The cats easily adjusted to coming in through two doors instead of one and I did not have to make any alterations to the wall.",cats,2
"I was dubious, but, it works really well for cleaning my very short pile carpet.

"I first heard about this product at my Vets office. It helps with your pet's health, the water is circulated and filtered. My cats seem to like the running water.

There have been no UTI problems with either of our cats since we have switched.",cats,2

"Mushers Secret protects our Schnauzer against the Chicago cold throughout the winter. While it provides some protection against salt getting into his paw pads, it really is not a complete solution and it does not eliminate the need to clean dirty feet upon reentry into your home(try disposable boots for this). However, if your dog hates shoes as much as ours does, Mushers Secret will solve 80% of your needs.Mushers Secret does not stain rugs and furniture, but you can see little footprints if you look at the right angle on hardwood floors (easily cleaned up).",cats,2

A divider was provided, and had I done my research on Amazon first, we could have bought this one crate from the moment we brought our little man home and never would have had to get another crate. It's well constructed, and I would highly recommend this crate to anyone who's on the fence about ordering one online.",dogs,3

"I think my dog would love the ball. Unfortunately, when it arrived, it was clearly not what I had hoped for. The seam, where the two halves of the ball come together, had multiple leaks...some so large I could see inside! How could this get past quality control? Overall the ball is solid because of the thickness of the material, but I cannot put water/sand in it at all because it immediately leaks out through the holes. Very, very displeased.",dogs,3
"I have one of these in my Gray's cage and she sits on it all the time. In addition, she loves to hang upside down on it and swing her body - which is pretty darn funny! I just purchased a second shelf for my other Gray's cage. I think he will like it too. Their cages are both large and have several perches each. This is a supplementary item. Always make sure your bird has correctly sized perches of different materials in his/her cage so that they don't get foot damage from sitting on the same exact thing constantly. This shelf would be too big for a small bird bird, such as parakeet or cockatiel, but is perfect for medium and large parrots.",birds,0

"I bought a 2-pack of the chicken flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very ""everlasting"" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint). I've got a Chicken and a Liver treat in the ball now and she enjoys them both. It takes effort now to enjoy it, and she works on it for over a week until there's nothing left but a treat disc left in the ball. The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it. The Vanilla Mint is her fave though.Two paws up!",dogs,3

"This cage is pretty good. A little too much money for what you get though. I like the fact that this cage is not wire. The hamsters seem to be happy with the clear view versus the wire cage view. I guess I can't blame them. The wheel is big, and the hamsters just love the heck out of it. Four of them get on it at a time. There is always one who isn't in sync with the pace, so they wind up flopping around in there as the wheel turns. Nobody gets hurts, and it's slightly funny. Lets see, the food dish doesn't allow large food items to get through. (You know how hamster food has those weird looking lucky charms looking pieces). Anyway, I threw it out and got a separate dish to put on the ground. I replaced the food dispenser slot with some tubes. The deal is, those 2 long tubes on the top, well, if you have dwarf hamsters, let me tell you right now, ""they won't use it"". They will never use it. They are scared of it, it's hard for them to climb it, and they do nothing but 'free fall' down it. I took mine out, and havn't really found a good use for them as of yet. The water bottle is kind of weird. I actually couldn't tell, so I put mine in upside down. Water was not coming out. Fortunately I was using the emty hole space at the top for a more traditional water bottle they utilized. O' and the floor is wire so the pine shavings just fall through the cracks.",small animals,5

I'm a big fan of the product and highly recommend it!",cats,2
I have a 45 pound puppy who is all muscle and loves to pull. He pulled so hard on a regular collar and a martingale collar that he would end up gasping and coughing. This harness instantly helped more than I expected. It didn't teach him to walk nicely without the harness though so we're still working on that.My only complaint is durability. I left it on him in the car for 10min and he destroyed it. He's never chewed through a leash so I was surprised. The nylon webbing is not as heavy duty as I would have expected.,dogs,3

"I had heard some good things about the Nylabones so thought I'd give it a try. We have an 8 year old Golden who's a moderate chewer, and a 6 months old Golden who's a crazy chewer. Neither of them have given this &#34;bone&#34; more than 30s of attention during the last month. I think it's just to hard dull. Based on this, and all the reviewers who seems to have problem with broken molars from these bone, I wouldn't recommend them. I think natural alternatives like beef bones and hoofs are a better alternative. I also tried an edible puppy chew (the large breed variant) from Nylabone. It took our puppy literally 90s to eat the whole thing...I expected a little more for an $8 bone to say the least...",dogs,3

Note though that I found this product for a little over half the Amazon price at a local retailer. Unusual, but it happens.",dogs,3
"This is the best dog shampoo I have ever used...my dogs smell better with this shampoo than they did when they came back from the groomers. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has pets.

"Perhaps if your cat always pees in the center of the litter box, then this unit works exactly as advertised. Mine is not such a case.With male cats whizzing in corners and creating adhesive wall-litter clumps, simply rolling the unit over will not earn you a clean litter box. Another issue is that the pull-out tray does not reach all the way to the back of the box, so anything in that area will often not be trapped.These weaknesses aside, the Omega Paw is still a huge improvement from a traditional litter box. Cleaning every other day for 2 cats, cleaning generally goes like this",cats,2

"After spending the first nine years of her life sleeping on a cotton mat or hardwood floor, my golden retriever asked for a bed. I got her this one. She requested green, believing it would go well with her coat. She loves it, and ""large"" is just the right size for her 65 pounds. She expressed the opinion that it's well-designed and well-made, as well as comfy, and I'd have to mostly agree. (I personally don't find it all that comfortable.) The sides are nice and high, providing a good pillow for times when she wants to read a bit before turning in.It took Diva awhile to get used to it. When the bed was new, she would spend the first 20-30 minutes in it, then move over to her mat. Gradually that time increased. After a few weeks she was spending the entire night happily curled up in her bed. My theory is that initially she became too warm in the bed, but then over time her body acclimated to it. That may seem odd, but some dog-owners have a similar experience when switching to a latex mattress.",dogs,3
"We have a new ""kid"" in our four legged family, a one year old, rambunctious put bull named Tim. He was completely unsocialized, and while he got along very well with our other dogs and our cats, he exhibited behaviors such as fence charging and barking, and barking at our new (and very tolerant) neighbor, which are behaviors that are completely unacceptable in our house.I needed a way to correct and redirect his behavior when we were not here to supervise him. After a supervised training period with the citronella collar, we can now leave Tim, and the rest of our pack, in the backyard to play, knowing a spray from the collar at the first bark from Tim will stop his barking, and also stop the excited energy from progressing to anything unwanted.The spray is not harsh (I tested it on myself), but it is a gentle, instantaneous reminder that barking is not acceptable.",dogs,3
"The ""Chuckit"" ball launcher has been a godsend and probably has saved my dog from injury on a number of occasions. Sounds like an odd testimony indeed, but I have a very sociable and trusting whippet and whippets are possibly one of the two fastest dogs on the planet. Before Jack was interested in chasing a ball, he would only want to entice dogs to chase him at the dog beach or dog park. Consequently, there have been dogs who became aggressive during the chase and have lain in wait for him to run by and have nipped and toppled him to get him under control. I realize this had to stop. So I bought a Chuckit and Jack was hooked immediately. Now he could care less about dogs chasing him - he is happy to greet them - but he does NOT want to be chased any longer. He is so addicted and hyperfocused on the ball. And IF a dog at the beach or park starts chasing him once I have ""chucked"" the ball, when the dog catches up with Jack, he just comes to a dead stop and will not let the dog chase him. Additionally, in two instances recently, I was able to use my chuck it to ward off dogs rushing towards us, off leash, with no owner in sight. They stayed clear of the crazy lady with the orange stick! So, it has been miraculous for us. Jack's brother is NOT interested in the ball and he has already had surgery for a serious dog attack - dogs chasing whippets - whippets with very thin skin and skin tears easily. I love my Chuckit launcher. But I ONLY buy the ULTRA balls which are orange rubber with a blue contrasting stripe because they bounce so nicely.",dogs,3
"This is a great window perch. Don't pay full price for it, but at just over $20 it's a good buy. Very easy assembly, no holes in the walls or sill required. Very stable. My cat loves it, massaging it with his paws sometimes. He jumps up on it from the floor, no problem. I like that it's not sticking out into the room to far, but because it's wide kittie has space to stretch out and lounge. I can definitely recommend it. In fact, I'm ordering a second one and just regret that I didn't get two right away.",cats,2

"I hope I can continue to find this product through Amazon at the price I paid. It is such a money-saver. Practical way of ""dosing"" the product by using a syringe (no needle, think measured eye-dropper) to apply flea control. I am not sure what makes the savings here----6 doses in one pack that you transfer into the provided glass vial and then measure out single dose from vial with the provided syringe applicator----but the savings is considerable. Sorry I didn't get the figures for the price difference in hand before I wrote this, but it is, like I said, considerable. Tried to find the product again and couldn't. I was in a hurry, so hopeful that when I check again, I will find it. The packaging and price shown here by Amazon is not the same as what I actually purchased. I remember paying under $20. and in the above described product application method. Maybe it was a onetime offer....",dogs,3

I thought the KONG brand was a brand that I could rely on. The designers really dropped the ball with this one.

"My Labrador/Redbone Coonhound LOVED his 'Froggy'. He lasted for about a month, which is about 3 weeks longer than most stuffed animals. Drogo would bring him to bed and rest his head on him, throw him around the room and chase him; I even taught him a trick with Froggy. I could put all his toys together and say 'where is Froggy' and he will dig through his toys and get Froggy out no problem. We walked around Petsmart on Black Friday and he saw Froggy down the KONG isle and grabbed him; they are now reunited, but sadly he knows how to kill Froggy now, so he's not lasting as long. He's missing the squeakers, stuffing in the head and his right arm/leg. I got him the beaver/squirrel for Christmas. Even though they only last for about a month, Drogo LOVES them to bits [literally]. Worth seeing him happy.",dogs,3
My little kitty loves this thing. I leave it on the floor when we are home so he can use it as his &#34;go to&#34; nap spot. Very sturdy construction. Easy to fold and unfold. Very wise investment.

Maybe she wanted quicker access to the squirrels but I would have hoped it stayed together longer than 45 min.So, if your dog is a ripper of all things stuffed, this toy doesn't stand a chance.",dogs,3

"This is a good quality toy and is just the right size for a toy-breed dog. The turf of hair on the ducky is cute, though I ended up snipping it off as it can easily come off even with some gentle tugging. I like that the squeaker can be easily replaced.",dogs,3
"Although the unit works as advertized, the single house cat is tracking the crystals all over the house! The crystals are very hard and sharp, and hurt when stepped on in bare feet or socks. Further, with hardwood floors, the crystals are getting ground into the wood finish!Yes, we have TWO mats outside the litter, including a ribbed rubber mat, but the crystals are still getting tracked everywhere. Constant sweeping required. Very disappointed. I am so tired of stepping on them. And this is one short haired cat, too!",cats,2

"Takes about a week to work but when it starts, it really brings down ammonia levels to zero. I tested the water and changed about 15% every two days (to keep ammonia levels low) until it kicked in.My only complaint is that the beneficial bacteria builds up really quickly on the bio-max and will block some of the water in the filter from going into the tank. However, that can be easily fixed by using some tank water (dip out some) and placing the bio-max pack in it so some of the bacteria will be removed (Using freshwater will kill all beneficial bacteria on the bio-max)",fish aquatic pets,4
"First of all, let me say that I've bought my last package of Tidy Cats after being a customer for over 30 years. You know a litter is useless when it can stink up a 1,500 sq. ft. basement with great ease. This litter has been changed by the company, Purina, to the point that renders it useless. Hubby just took back two 37 pound pails of this stuff after we went down to our basement and about keeled over from the smell. I threw out the rest of the litter, dumped it from the boxes (yes, Persians require TWO boxes per cat to do their business!) and refilled them with Arm & Hammer. The A&H is amazing - no odor whatsoever! LOVE that stuff! Plus, the Tidy Cats was jamming the automatic litter box, coating the edges, leaving me with a hugely disgusting mess to clean, DAILY. It's thicker, not as finely ground as before, with NO odor control. This 24/7 one was the one I just pitched. You know, it's pretty bad when the cat comes upstairs and paws your leg to get you to change the box he only used once. Come on, Purina, what are you doing? Buy the Arm & Hammer, you'll thank me daily for that decision!",cats,2

"These will do the job for any pet. They work nice, but once in a while they don't exactly get a nice clean cut and the nail can fray. IT think that's only if the animal moves around a lot though..

"My neighbor has a small, hyper-active dog that tends to bark at the slightest sound or anything that moves. Instead of walking the dog in the early morning, the neighbor lets the dog free on the patio and, of course, the dog barks. Unfortunately, my bedroom's windows are within a few feet of the neighbor's patio. I can't remember how many times I've be startled awake by this little dog's loud barking. So I set this unit up in my window and three days later - no more barking. The neighbor's dog avoids the patio so no more barking. I'd recommend it to anyone.",dogs,3
"I did read the reviews before ordering this automatic feeder and based on those reviews, I was quit skeptical about purchasing an item that received so many bad remarks. However, I am very glad that I did purchase the Petmate Le Bistro. I am not sure if they made some changes in the design or if I am just having good luck. The programming was simple and the feeder works flawlessly. I have been using this feeder for a little over a month now and I am very happy this automatic feeder. The only negative or change I would like to see would be a power cord for electricity with a battery backup.",cats,2
"Oster Power-Pro Ultra Cordless-Clipper Kit with Blade and Storage CaseI purchased this Oster PowerPro Ultra kit via Amazon back in Feb' 08, and - after four rounds of heavy use in six months - I am mostly pleased. I have two Old English Sheepdogs. My previous Wahl Kennel Pro clippers were pathetic when it came to removing their full coats and mats, but the Oster PowerPro Ultra with wide blocking blade (which I purchased via JeffersPet) flies through their mats and body coat, and the 40/10 blade takes care of the rest.

"There are a handful of automatic litterboxes on the market now, and they all collect the stool and seal it (more or less) into a container so you can conveniently dump it out once a week. If you've dealt with any of those though, you'll know that they work so-so, and that you won't get rid of the smell of the box and/or the trash can. All you can do is get used to it, and hope that your friends will, too.This machine is very different. The stool goes out into the sewage system, like it should, and the litter itself (and the rake, and the bowl!) is thoroughly washed when the cycle runs. These two feats make all the difference. It is as if you scrubbed clean your litterbox and replaced the contents every day! Actually, it's even better than that, because the plastic pellets used have no scent themselves, so your cat will never come up to you smelling of damp clay litter.The execution of this machine is above average. It's modular and it easily comes apart for cleaning. Unfortunately, mine came with a warped bowl which would stop spinning every now and then when I first ran it. However, all I did to resolve that was to manually help it spin during its first cycle. I read in a forum that the heat of the built-in blowdryer during the cleaning cycle would help unwarp the bowl, and it did. It is true that the ""shake the rake"" mechanism spills a few pellets onto the ground, but I find this minimal - and again, they are just plastic pellets, not clay which discolor your socks/carpet, etc.The machine uses sanitizer cartridges which supposedly last for 60 washes. I'm a bit on the fence on this - it's clearly a money- making scheme, it even has a tamper-proofing chip in it for the ""protection of your cats"". The price is just so that you will let it go, although that won't help the landfills. N.B. I haven't found any instructions of how to refill those things on the internet either. Minus 1 star for this!Speaking about consumables, I was surprised to find an extra sanitizer cartridge and pellet container (to top off those that stick to the waste and go down the drain) in the box - apparently CatGenie is running a promotion and Amazon mimicked this despite the lower price and free shipping. I don't think they'll honor the extended rebate though.My 2 cats took to it easily. All I did to acclimate them was to move their clay litterbox to the new location the day before the genie arrived, then swapped them without further ado. And one of the cats is a 8-year old wuss, the kind that doesn't like change and can't be located one hour after the doorbell rings.I'm quite happy with my purchase at this point; this ingenious solution does away with the century- old cat litter problem, and I think it's competitively priced as well.One thing I should mention though",cats,2
"The reviews are right on this one. I purchased this to keep my small dogs from going downstairs where I suspected they were urinating on the carpet. After a couple zaps neither of them wanted anything to do with it. We don't even turn it on, it just sits there and the dogs never go downstairs.",dogs,3
"I have been using nail caps on my cat for about 2 years now. I like this product because the cleat lock system seems to make the cap stay on better than those without. I like to get bright colors, because it is easier to tell how when he needs replacements to put on. He cries occasionally when I put them on, but not too much. It depends on how well I cut the nail before putting on the caps. All in all, it's a great product that lasts much longer than those bought at local pet stores.",cats,2
We bought this to keep the dogs out of the room where we keep the cat food and litter boxes. Perfect and well made. Worth the extra money to have a substantial gate that you can walk through.

I would definitely recommend to anyone.",dogs,3
"I read the reviews & thought with 2 kittens (6-7 months old)this would be the perfect chance to start a litter-free life! So, with that we placed our order & once the item arrived we got right to work. The girls did great with their toilet training in the beginning and we took it slow so they weren't rushed. I thought we were well on our way to toilet trained cats!They did well until we took out the 3rd ring. Once that happened...no more pooping in the toilet. They got close - the floor beside it. I tried it all - going back a ring and letting them adjust even slower & taking out only half the ring next time, cleaning it after each ""elimination"" (which trust me, is a lot for 2 young cats). Still nothing - they would pee in it but have continued to poop on the floor beside the toilet. After several months I've had enough. Tonight the Citi Kitty is getting trashed and their litter box is coming back out. I'll be picking up the old stand-by we had with our first cat that worked well for years...the Littermaid.I also thought the price was excessive for the cheap plastic you got. The rings did not come out very easy, some I had to cut out instead of punching. It seems you're really paying for the cute packaging & their marketing instead of the actual item. I wouldn't waste my money on this again. Perhaps your cat will fare better. I had high hopes after the first few rings but ring 3 caused the whole thing to fall apart for my girls. They just couldn't poop in it & I'm really tired of cleaning up poop off the floor for so long!Also if you choose to get this product, do remember they state your bathroom will be messy while toilet training. For me that was understatement - ours was a daily disaster. I literally have litter stuck in every crevice of the toilet and don't know if I will ever get it out. Litter is still everywhere, even though I clean the bathroom daily, if not more!",cats,2

Now I have this useless item that will not fit on my uniquely designed tank-however my problem is still not fixed-hopefully this company plans on making things right as I see a lot of products I wouldn't mind purchasing-but will DEFINITELY forgo if my money isn't refunded and/or a new ""SPECIMEN CONTAINER"" for a 15-20 gallon tank arrives at my address.

"The main issue I had with this purchase is the time it took to be delivered. The seller had already charged me for the purchase and it showed having been sent, however when I tried to track the package a few days later, it showed it had only been initialized, not actually dropped off or picked up by USPS yet. So it took about a week longer than originally quoted to arrive. I even had to email the buyer to ask them about the status of the purchase at one point, but it eventually arrived and I've been generally satisfied with it since. The battery dies fairly quickly on the remote.. after only a few uses. I've learned to remove the battery if I know I won't be walking her the next day.

"My golden retriever is 10 years old and I've been through many brands of seat covers for the back seat. Some wear thin sooner than others, but most have the same problem....the straps which go around the headrest eventually break off the main hammock. What's special about this hammock is that the straps are connected to the hammock with metal clips which hook through metal grommets. Huge difference!!! I've thrown away so many covers before they were really worn out because the straps broke. I also appreciate the parts that slide between the bottom and back of the seat to help hold it in place.I did recently buy a car with leather seats, which proved to be very slippery with this cover (and most covers I've used). I solved that problem by laying my Yogitoes towel over the back seat (it has small rubber nubs on one side to hold it in place) and then placing the cover over the towel.",dogs,3

"Our 7 mo. Golden Retriever puppy instantly loved this toy, jamming her nose into the plush tree holes to get at the squeaky critters and carry them around a bit. Though we adored seeing her happy and supervised her closely, I think this toy has one considerable flaw- it seems poorly constructed. The concept is great, but the object just didn't hold up for the recommended play. Just by playing at our feet for a few minutes at a time, she popped a hole in the bottom, ripped the thread holding the felt leaves and seams holding the tree trunk together, and yanked out loose stuffing. She also easily ripped off the weakly adhered fur on the animal tails. We use and love interactive toys, but even for a supervised toy, it didn't stay intact for even a few days. She's had the iQube too, which was a bit sturdier. I wish this company would make a better product for the good concepts they have.",dogs,3
My neigbors dog and mine play together and love these balls. The hard rubber assures a long life and the bright orange makes them easily visible when the dogs forget to bring them back. Unlike regular tennis balls they will not puncture or have fuzz that dogs invariably ingest. Easily washable they outlast regular balls by a factor of at least 20 thus actually making them a bargain.,dogs,3

"My male Cairn has carried this toy (he has the cow, which has lasted longer than most other noise-making toys he's owned) around since Grandma got it for him over a year ago. His best play buddy (terrier mix) also got one and she loves hers, too. Incredibly annoying, yes, especially when the dog goes to great lengths to bring it to you, no matter what you're doing, because he wants to play! My husband and I actually love the sound because it's so cheerful - kind of makes whatever you're doing seem less important and injects some much needed humor...the pup always seems to know when we need it most!It's held up to tug-of-wars with our other Cairn, throwing, repetitive biting, etc, for over a year. That said, it's died a slow, miserable death, and as the music dies it sounds more like Death Metal than a kids' song, but that is equally hilarious. We're on to our next Deedle Dude and can't decide which one to get!We highly recommend this if you love playing with your dog, have a dog that likes causing mischief with his toys, and if you both appreciate light-hearted humor.

"No one has rated this amazing product so I thought I would (I loved it that much!).This stuff is great! I originally bought this for my kitten (bought the smaller dosage) and all of a sudden my 4yr old cat started having diarrhea (and decided to go all over my floor over and over)! So I had to think fast and although I wasn't sure if the smaller dosage would do much, I thought I'd try anyways and what would you know it worked! It was gone in a flash! If your cat/kitten/dog has diarrhea give them this! I am so happy I will definitely get this again if I have any more problems in the future!By the way the chicken and rice diet works too. While I was waiting for the Diagel, I put my kitten on a fast for 24hrs then gave her a mix of plain white rice and bland chicken for 2 days, then slowly mixed in her normal food over time and within a week it was gone! (This was after my vet gave me some crap that didn't work) There was obviously no need for Diagel after that diet had worked but it was nice having it around once my cat got diarrhea too! There's no way he could've gone on a fast for 24hrs, he's such a baby when he's hungry!PS",cats,2

Although one is better and I could take him home-he is still shaking by the way- the other now has an infection in her blood and her white blood cells are going crazy.

"After doing tons of research on many different models, I bought the Bubbler. Many of the other product reviews talked about difficulty of cleaning and the necessity of keeping the water at a certain level. I personally don't believe that water filtration is a big deal. Cats just want water that tastes fresh and is reasonably clean. Within minutes of the arrival of the Bubbler, I had it up and running. The water tank is large and holds a great deal of water. This is important if you have more than one pet drinking out of it. Right away, my cats were attracted to the sound. One of my cats sat beside it and played with the water for 20-30 minutes. The reason I started looking for this product is that my tabletop water fountain died and my cats had always got their drinks from it. The Bubbler makes a lovely little bubbling sound very much like my table top fountain. Because of its placement in my kitchen, all of my 3 cats and 3 dogs drink from it. It is easy to clean and disassemble and reassemble. I believe the tank and reservoir can be placed in the dishwasher if desired. I like the fact that I don't have to fill it every day. Plus, since the pump is separate from the water, you don't have to worry about the pump burning up when the water is low. I have found nothing to complain about. I would recommend this to any one without reservation.",cats,2

I got 3 cats and the old litter tray always very smelly and lots litter sand came out from the tray and even the urine liquid.Booda dome does much better job. It looks very funky and also did a very good job than the old fashion little tray.The lining joint of the two parts are so fit that no more urine leaks. And it does reduce the smell. Most of the sand trapped on the stairs area.One negative that it is quite large and quite difficult to wash it.I couldn't find it in Australia so I bought from amazon.

Very disappointing and total waste of money. I bought the indoor and outdoor bark deterrants and initially they seemed to get my 3 dogs attention but after 1 week or less they were all back to the usual barking. Maybe for other breeds it works but not my Jack Russels or my Boxer/Whippet mix,dogs,3

"I have 5 dogs that are mine since I consider them too high maintenance to be adopted out. I have spent the last year and a half rescuing dogs from high kill shelters and after vaccinating, spaying, neutering, caring for many different needs, have found homes for 352 dogs. Many have fostered at my home. All dogs have thrived on Wellness original formula. My largest, oldest dog is 14 and weighs 140 pounds and is doing great, though before I found Wellness, the lab/chesapeake was showing symptoms of hip dysplasia. He actually has lost 20 pounds and doing well.",dogs,3
"and for such an inexpensive simple gadget it has brought so much fun. So basic, but then again you can buy cats the most expensive kitty condo and they'd rather sit in a newly opened Amazon box.......Pattie",cats,2
"The price is right, it was shipped on time and with the tops taped to prevent any leaks, smells good (mild tropical scent), low suds, rinses very well. After 3 days the pups still smell great and they have no sensitivities to the shampoo. This is what I'll buy again when I need to restock.",cats,2
This dog bowl not only looks good but takes abuse from my growing German Shep pup. The bowls are strong and easy to clean. This size is fine for pups 10 lbs. and over. The picture shows a full bowl and hard to tell size. More than 10 cups of food fit. Way too much to leave in the bowl. If you feed your pup 1 or 3 times a day it is great. Bend legs outward a little before putting into upper frame. It will keep legs from falling out.,dogs,3
"After years of struggling with LitterMaid products - spillover, clogging, lack of sufficient power, noisy, etc., the ScoopFree is a great improvement. Had to 'transition' the cat to use it by initially adding the old scoopable litter, but after a week or two, now able to use crystals alone. Much quieter, very efficient, doesn't get clogged, minimal spillage.Occasionally needs some 'assistance' and do notice an odor at times. A bit more expensive for crystals, trays, etc, but worth it. Chose the option of the overpriced permanent tray, liner and bags of crystals.The cat gives his nod of approval...",cats,2
Like others I found that this product has varying effectiveness based on the type of dog. But for my maltese and other dog it works great. I only used it for a few days I can already see result in my little dogs are barking less at night and when I go to shower in the morning. They gotten a lot of bad habits over the years and while they still go into barking fits they don't do it at night or when it is most annoying. Best 13 dollars I ever spent.,dogs,3
"Was looking for a country-style cat bed for a little girl to keep all her furreal friends in. Has worked very well. Helps keep the ""babies"" tidy and off the floor. The bed itself is gorgeous. Could not find anything near as nice to look at in the local stores. Appears it would be rather comfy for real cats too.",dogs,3
"The purpose of this opinion is to share the fact that this product does seem to lessen the hostilities between two of my felines that have an extreme dislike for each other.

Overall, I will continue to use it with the hopes that my fellas will get along one day.",cats,2
"I got this thing, and I must have miscalculated the measurements, because it's huge! It's almost as wide as my hallway! My puppy has no interest in it, and it's not very easy to clean the grate, so we just took the grate off.

"I bought one of these a few years ago for my small dog. It came with a six-inch tether that hooked onto the seatbelt. I just bought one again for a friend who has a large dog - no tether. It was ridiculously hard to try to get the seatbelt through the hole in the back (since the shoulder strap is attached to the lap strap). I e-mailed the company and asked where I could get the tether and they said they don't sell it. I ordered it elsewhere but it's something that should be included with this product. Otherwise, the dog can't move in the seat - they ought to be able to move a little bit so they can get comfortable. It is a well-made product though. My little dog won't ride in the car without it.",dogs,3

"After seeing the hit and miss reviews I bought my catgenie and hoped for the best. Almost 6 months now and not looking back.Initially it was horrible. Only one cat would use it and we have four. Then we completely took away the litter box. We had 3 cats using it and one that refused. After several weeks of trying everything and dealing with poop on the floor we started placing our last cats poop in the cat genie. He would poop on the floor and we would put it in the contraption, simple as that. Then he finally got the picture and started using it.There are several things on instructables.com that came in handy. The drain hose on ours is routed in the toilet now so that it goes down the trap and doesn't create poop soup in the toilet bowl. Also knowing how to use a power drill to drain down the unit is a lifesaver.As for operational problems. The catgenie does not like to be turned off for extended periods of time. This can cause the poop in it to harden and cause more problems. Also if the unit floods with water and you let it sit, ie the wife shuts off the thing that keeps beeping, the water sensor will get dirty and you will have to clean it.As for the poop soup in the machine people complain about its really simple, if the water sensor gets dirty this happens. Taking the unit apart and cleaning the water level sensor takes 5 minutes.After figuring out all those problems though the catgenie works like a champ. We are going to purchase another here soon to keep the cats from bugging when there is poop in the machine and they need to use it. Four cats is too many for one catgenie.If you can make it through the first month it's smooth sailing after that. Well worth the cost and initial hassle.****************March 09Still going strong. I refill my own cartridges now with no hassle. There are kits available, but if you have a little electronics know how then reprogramming the chip is easy and a lot cheaper. (Around $30 for an I2C programmer) I also have created a litter trap to keep the pellets from going into the toilet, so far so good on that. I will post an instructable on how to make your own as soon as I am sure I have all the kinks ironed out.As a side note, do not try to have four cats using the same catgenie. You end up with poop on the floor and a rush order to amazon.",cats,2
"I got this cage for my holland lop. He Loves the platforms, he goes up and down and sleeps on different levels although he likes the 3rd floor best. It took him a couple weeks to get to the top and I didnt pressure him, He got to the first level after 2 weeks and then a week or so later he made it to the top.The cage is much larger then I imagined and they picture led me to believe, but it doesnt take up any less space then any other rabbit cage out there. what I like is that he gets more room without taking up any additional floor space (important for NYC living).The main selling point was that it has the pull out tray which makes for easy cleaning. I find it pretty effective, with the minor exception that since rabbits pee in corners and stuff the corners and under the grate can get pretty gross. I find that I can put kitty litter in the drawer and it works well because the bunny cant eat it and it absorbs the pee. My bunny has long fur and I wanted it to stay clean.It was very easy to assemble and the bottom of the cage is very soft on bunny feet. It is very sturdy and well made out of quality materials. I like the pee guard which keeps pee and hay from ending up all over the floor.If I had the choice I would probably get this cage again. I only gave it 4 stars because it has the hard to clean ledge under the grate that collects poop and stuff.",bunny rabbit central,1

"Nine pounds doesn't sound like much, but believe me, it's a LOT of hay. I have one rabbit about 6-8lbs. He grazes on Timothy Hay all day long and the 9lb bag lasts him almost 6 months. I have two air-tight dog food containers I use to store his hay so it's always fresh when I refill his hay feed bale. Oxbow grows great hay, but make sure you have some air-tight containers to store the unused hay so it doesn't get stale and/or attract bugs.",small animals,5
"I have two mini-dachshunds who spend part of their day in a very large kennel. Mostly they are house and lap dogs and we take a few walks everyday. I don't mind when they bark in the house because it is usually to alert me to something. But when in the kennel they barked incessantly and at everything and anything...squirrels, cats, cars, people, a leaf blowing in the wind.Within an hour of wearing the collars in the kennel there was silence. Withina few days, the female no longer needed to wear the collar. The male has to wear his collar maybe once per week to remind him. The female has always been the smarter of the two. I leave the collars hanging on the kennel when not in use,and even this visual reminder seems to help. The collars are a little big and clunky on my 10 lb. dogs, but this isn't a serious issue. They are annoyed by the collars, but not uncomfortable.",dogs,3

"I heard about this tool through a friend when I was talking about all the hair my new pupppy leaves on my hard surface floors (I don't have any carpet). Immediately, I ordered this product and use it on my puppy every other day or every 3 days to keep the floors free of it. My 8-month old puppy loves it and melts when I start using it on her. She even wants me to use it on her tummy. The only thing she doesn't like is when I say ""we're done""! This dog is a chow mix but her daddy must have had lab in him as she sheds like a lab.I also use it on my short-hair cat and she loves it, too. I get more hair out of her with this then I do with her cat brush. Again, it doesn't work so well on the long-haired cat.My other dog is also a chow mix but the FURminator does not work on her because she has different type of hair.I recommend this to anyone who wants to eliminate dust bunnies on the floor left behind by pets.",cats,2

"I have a 7 month old schnoodle. He's only 10 lbs but while he's been teething he's been capable of destroying everything! He was initially very careful with this dragon. He would creep up to it and lick its tongue.. then run away when we squeezed it and the tongue flipped out.. after some introduction, he was all over this thing. Absolutely loved it. 1 day later we looked at the poor dragon and his tongue was missing! and one of his toes were gone too... :( I thought it would be more durable then it was.. I'm sure our puppy ended up eating these missing rubber parts despite our careful supervision. Also, we were concerned about the make/ coloring of the dragon. This was made in China? is there a possibility of lead in the coloring? (flashback; all the toy recalls in china).. Our puppy never got sick or anything, just our paranoid thoughts. anyway, though our puppy loved it, this is why I gave it only 3 stars.",dogs,3
I ordered this item on 9/26/06 because I was gone over a weekend and somehow my roomates managed to gunk up my tank royally. I went to Petsmart in person and they didn't have these filters that I need. So I ordered these. I ended up not getting them until the middle of November. that's over a month!!!! I called customer service for Petsmart and the only thing they told me was they would cancel the order and I could go get them from the store. Basic they did absolutly nothing.

"Yeowww! catnip is potent stuff. We buy the nip itself to sprinkle on scratchers and into cardboard boxes for our cats to enjoy. It smells strong, is long-lasting, and all of our cats love it.

"I received this as a gift from a friend.From the moment I opened the plastic wrap on this toy and unleashed its cloud of aerosolized catnip into my living room, I knew this was going to be an unforgettable experience.My cat, Commie, ran over to the toy, inhaled deeply, and flopped across it as if every bone in his body had simultaneously turned into pudding. For the next few minutes, he rolled around and waved his limbs as if he were in a magical fantasy world.When he regained some modicum of dignity, he noticed the white plastic ball in front of him. I won't pretend to know what was going through his head at this point, but when he flopped a limb against this ball, *it moved*! And not only did it move, but it went away from him and then returned through unknown/unknowable means. How did it get back here? Send it away! Another swat, another mysterious voyage and return. Soon, the room was filled with the persistent sound of that ball being swatted around. A new friend had been made.The synaptic wiring between ""aerosolized catnip"" and ""rolling ball toy"" having been established, my cat has enjoyed its use daily since then. Forming this connection right away is a genius move on the manufacturer's part.",cats,2

"We have two 90 pound dogs and it felt like we were filling their water bowl every 4 hours. I love the 3 gallon capacity, and now we refill the water every 4-5 days which is great. My complaint, though, is that it is cheaply made and very hard to line the threads up to put the top back on. We wrestle with it for several minutes every time and we never know how it will line up in relation to putting it back in the container. If its off a little, its very hard to open the top to let the water out.I love that the water lasts 4-5 days. If it didn't, this would be returned because of the hassle with the top every time.",cats,2

It is made from corn.World's Best Cat Litter 00558 Original 34lbIt absorbs odors well but it does not have any smelly perfumes to discourage the cat from using it and smell up the place.

"1st off I want to say that I'll be surprised if my feedback isn't altered like two of my other honest feedbacks have been. #1 the description is misleading (shows SX1 when it's indeed an SX3 which is important to note because the Forever rake won't work in the updated SX3 or SX4 models.) #2 it was in poor condition with marks on it when it arrived and appeared either refurbished or like it had been sitting in a warehouse for many years. I'm giving it 3 stars simply based on the poor purchase from Amazon combined with the fact that I happen to own 2 of these and love them. They were both purchased elsewhere. I purchased the 2nd one from the same original place as my 1st one after I returned this one to amazon. So, I would say buy the item but, not from Amazon. I've purchased many things through the years from Amazon that I've been happy with (including the 6pk refills for this litter box). And this is the only item I've rated this way after having this experience. So, yours could be of better appearance when it arrives and may have been a single incident for me? Doesn't change the fact that the description is incorrect. So if you're purchasing a forever rake (like I did) don't waste your time because you'll have to turn around and send the rake back (to a seperate company) at your own expense. On an added note, the optional forever tray is great as well as the owner of the company who makes it. Great guy! And you can purchase the Tidy cat crystal litter for it locally. I pay $13 for an 8lb bag at Target & Walmart (even less when I have a coupon). 1 bag fills both of my trays at the time of each cleaning.",cats,2

First we saw pieces about the size of 1/4 a rice in her feces. Then I found her with a piece about the size of a dime in her mouth. It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily.We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones.Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.I did not buy Nylabones here.

What a joke-did notwork out. After a few days, I found my bullseye pillgun I forgot I even owned! I put a little margaine onthe pill ( as suggested on the website) to allow the pill to go down smooth) and put it in the end of thepillgun. Very easy! I put the lever in the pillgun that shoots the pill into the mouth. My husband heldhim on his lap, put his hand on the cats head and lifted the cats head high. I imediately shot the pill into his mouth( the cats mouth-not my husbands-ha ha).The pill went down easily. I tapped his throat ( the cats) andimmediately gave him wet food. ( again-the cat). Water or wet food should always be given after a pill.I have a few more days left of doing this and believe me it is no longer a chore. It is as easy as pieand I truly suggest buying this pill gun.

Still, none of my pets had any bad reaction except my bulldog who would try to wipe it off her back since she can't stand anything with strong smell (like acetone, perfume or anything like that). After a week or so all the fleas were gone! We didn't even have to work that hard to get rid of the fleas that were probably all over the house. After 3 months of using it I found a flea on my dog only a couple of times. I'm ordering more now and I will keep using Bio Spot as long as it keeps the fleas off my pets and house!",dogs,3

"Very expensive, but a Great product. My blessing is a pound doggy, a dark gray & white Shih Tzu, we've named Angel (not because of the product, that was pure irony). It is not a cure, in fact, discontinuing use allowed the tear staining to return. However, since I resumed the regiment, her eyes and overall coat is clearly healthy. She us a finicky eater, but this powder is easily accepted. Knowing the product works, when I reordered, I selected the larger size. It appears to have been exposed to some moisture as it is rock hard and has to be chipped apart.Should have compplained and sent it back, but, it still works and this is the first time I've had a moment to anything. Angel's eyes are clear. Would love to send the before and after pictures again, they never got posted.",dogs,3

"I purchased a Cascade 700 almost four years ago for my salt water aquarium and it still is running very well present day! It is a simple filteration set up, the quick disconnet hoses are nice and filter itself does keep the water very clear. Penn Plax customer service seems very nice and responsive from my experince. When I first purchased the filter, one of the elbow tubes was flattened on one end. I emailed Penn Plax CS and they mailed me out the replacment the very next day! I've had a few other filters; Marineland C series and a couple of their HOB, and yet I still use the Cascade 700!You have to make sure that you get the shut off valves just right prior to unscrewing the hoses from the filter itself. If not, water will leak out! Do not waste your money the ""polishing filters"" Go to Wal-Mart or any craft store and purchase yourself some pillow stuffing! Its way cheaper and from experince, I still have nice, crystal clear water!",fish aquatic pets,4

"Great home for my 12"" albino pleco! Just moved up to a 55 gallon tank from a 20 gallon in order to give my pleco and a couple of his buddies more room to move around. This is just the ticket. I shopped several local pet supply stores and just couldn't find something big enough with an ""airplane hanger"" style shape that my fish could glide in and out of easily. Amazon.com to the rescue! This log has some nice, realistic detail and color and I really like the large hole in the side and top of the log, too. I was a little worried that it would look too big in my tank (even knowing the measurements in advance, I was surprised at the size when I opened the package!), but it is a perfect fit in my 23""x26""x25"" bowfront cube.

Just because a Betta can survive in small conditions because in their natural environment during the drought season doesn't mean that we should keep them in those conditions. Many Bettas don't survive these rough conditions that nature provides in their home territory. If you buy small cups and throw a fish in them- you are just condemning them to solitary confinement in a prison cell. My Betta is in a 10 gallon tank and you wouldn't believe the fun he has exercising and playing in all that space. If you care- you would never subject this beautiful creature to cups of water if you saw them in gallons of HEATED (they are tropical fish) water!!!!!! Study this fish and you will understand that we take for granted their survival mechanisms and exploit them for our own foolish pleasure.,fish aquatic pets,4

This is the first time we ever tried to cage train one of our dogs and we chose the Midwest Life Stages crate to do just that. It is very easy to assemble and the extra wall to make the inside smaller for your puppy is a wonderful idea that really works. The odd thing that we didn't expect is that our Rocky loves to go into it to rest without us forcing him to.It has front and side doors for easy access and is fairly lightweight. This cage is definitely a good buy considering that the price of cages in the store versus Amazon is much higher in many cases.Not much else to say about this crate other than it is a must buy and it well worth the money.,dogs,3

"This thing is a blast and my German Shepherd really loves how it flies. It almost hovers sometimes... she could catch it 9/10 throws. Lots of fun.But... it falls apart. I didn't ever let Juno chew this thing, it was a fetch-only toy. She is an aggressive frisbee catcher, I guess, often snapping them out of the air or pouncing on it as it tumbles through its landing. Anyhow, it's weak around the 'feet' and that is where the first tear happened. From there, a similar tear afflicted the other 3 feet and eventually the feet were nearly coming off, exposing the tubes inside. Eventually one section of tube worked itself out of the fabric. It still flies as of today, but it's about 8 or 9 days old. Not exactly an economical choice. I'd recommend this if your dog doesn't actually catch the frisbee... or is extremely gentle with it when it does. Great idea, just not durable enough.",dogs,3

"Puppy loves her crate. The best part is the divider (once you get it in place). I am crate training now so it is good to have a smaller space that will keep puppy from voiding in her den, and to later be able to move the divider as she grows so that I don't have to buy a new crate later.I would suggest buying or borrowing a small carrier though as this crate (medium) is not suitable for travel in most cars (unless you have an SUV).The divider is a bugger to insert and move around, but once in place it's great. The crate is almost fully assembled when it comes. It unfolded and was together is about a minute or two. Took about 15 frustrating minutes to get the divider in place. GREAT first buy for new furry friends.Oh, btw, picking the right size was the biggest headache when considering buying a crate. There is a really good sizer on [...] I have a rat terrier and she will go from puppy size (about 2.5 pounds at 8 weeks) to full grown (about 17 pounds and about the same length and width of a Jack Russell Terrier) VERY comfortably in a medium sized crate.",dogs,3
"This device is for removing pet fur from furniture or rugs. It works very well for that function. Do not try to remove fur directly from your pet with this device.

That said, the nubby rubber bristles do feel good on a human being's back, if you can get someone to rub your back with it. But if you're thinking you can use this as a depilatory for back hair, think again. It won't work and you'll just be frustrated.",cats,2

I think a lot of the bad reviews for these pads are due to the pet going off the pad edge with pee. I've been using the pads now for 3 years with our Havanese 5 pound dog. We lay two down in her room and they are pretty much good for a day. (We did start out using the plastic pee-pad holders but find they are no longer necessary now that she is older and doesn't miss the pads.)We are very happy with the performance of these pads after 3 years and continue to purchase them. Would like Amazon to offer them as a Subscribe and Save item and not have to worry about buying every couple months.,dogs,3

It has not been a problem. From time to time (rarely), the wheel slows down or starts and stops, but I've always managed to get it going again.I recommend this as a very good product.Something has changed because the picture on here does not match what I have.

They would be stuck helplessly inside, and just the thought of that so tears at my heart!

At least this way, by putting these bright red stickers on a door and/or window where rescue personnel are likely to see them, telling them you have animal friends inside, what kind and how many, they can at least attempt to save their lives. It at least gives your pets a better chance for survival. And I don't know about you, but that gives me much more peace of mind. Thank you to whoever invented these!",dogs,3

I have no problem with bugs or mice or anything in my house, so this works perfect for me. The only thing my hubby does not like is that we used to just keep the food in a bag so it never smelled when he fed the dogs because it dispersed in the air constantly.

"This is a perfect product for dogs that may need to wear a muzzle for an training or for an extended period of time. It allows the dog to open his mouth wide enough to pant and take small treats, but not to bite. The muzzle futs flat across the neck and top of the nose and is not at all bulky (like a basket muzzle is). Most dogs seem very comfortable wearing it (especially when you train them to wear it by rewarding them with small treats). It's perfect for intorducing dogs to each other when one dog has dog aggressive tendencies, for especially anxioius/fear aggressive in new or scary situations (vet, company, etc.) and for desensitization training of aggressive dogs. This muzzle is a perfect training tool! As a veterinarian, I highly recommend this product!",dogs,3
"When I heard about this litter box, I was really excited. I bought it immediately and set it up. It worked fine and did what it said it did, but there are some major flaws.* The ""regular"" is very small. The box itself is a reasonable size, but the area where the cats have to dig & use is half that size. My cats sometimes peed or pooped outside by accident (they're not very bright).* PEE. I don't really know how it did this, but sometimes when I'd roll it over, pee would come pouring out of it, and sometimes I'd find pee under it without even rolling it. I think it must have pooled in the lips between the top and bottom of the box. This problem is why I threw mine away.* The sifting grate is a little too big so that a lot of small urine clumps go through and you have to manually scoop them anyway.* The sifting grate also gets clogged up because surprise, cats don't know where to aim, and so they'd pee on it and get it wet, and litter stuck to it, and you know the rest.Overall, a good idea, but the problems above (ESPECIALLY the pee-leaking issue. GROSS.) make it no good for me.",cats,2

"The crate is okay. It has a divider and serves its purpose for a dog that is comfortable in a crate. The two-door design is nice. The metal wires are fairly flimsy, and I could see a determined dog destroying the crate and maybe getting hurt in the process. We use it for a puppy to sleep in at night. He is in the bedroom with us, so if he got too wild in the crate, I could address it. I would be hesitant to use this crate to separate dogs or for a high strung dog that will be left alone. I am writing this review because the crate actually cut me last night. I reached between the wires to move a toy inside the crate and caught my hand on a rough spot. I now have a three inch slice down the side of my hand. We have a PetMate crate for our other dog that seems much sturdier and safer without any pointy areas on the metal that could snag a human hand or a puppy paw. If your pup will be well behaved and not push the sides of this crate, it is probably okay, but if not, I would try another brand. I updated this and took away a star. I snagged my pants on another rough spot and ruined them. The company really needs to address the way the metal is connected and create smoother surfaces.",dogs,3

"I have a 10 gallon tank that I had been having trouble with. Too much algae and the filter I had clogged a lot. After shopping around, I stumbled on this. It seemed to be what I was needing so I got it. My first impression was that this thing is huge compared to my tank. I thought it was going to be too powerful and push my fish around. Still, I installed it hoping that it would all work out. After it was installed, it took a little finagling to find the exact position I wanted for it.It has now been installed for six weeks. My tank is much cleaner and I have had no trouble with the filter. While it is really powerful, it doesn't seem to bother my fish too much. In fact most days, I can find one of my clownfish playing in the stream. One of the things that I like most about it is that I will be able to use it if I decide to upgrade my tank to a larger one (the place I currently live is restricting me to 10g). This is quite a good filter and will be in use for several years for me.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I loved this Doggie Pet Pen, so well built and roomy for my two dogs (Shih Tzu & Chihuahua). I use the pen as an alternative for a cage while I work. I have the 8 piece pen and have room for two beds, water bowls & toys. Kudos, to this company, very well priced as compared to other major retailers. I will use my pen indoor/outdoor.",dogs,3
I am a dog groomer and I have used many products on my clients. Since trying Buddy Wash I have never looked back. I use this on all my dogs even over the whitening shampoos and in place of the oatmeal for the sensitive types. My clients owners rave about the smell of their dogs and always ask what shampoo I use. Great product! By the way I always use the lavender and mint.,cats,2
"I finally figured out why my dog that i rescued needed to be rescued. Apparently his previous owners got fed up with repairing their back yard fencing, so they put him up for adoption. They failed to mention this little bit of useful information. I figured it out after having him for 2 days. He was a fence fighter! (He wanted to play with the neighbors dogs) Perfect for my back yard WOODEN fence. After i replaced a good portion of my fence, i came across the wireless fence. After only 3 days, it cured my dog of this problem. i can't recommend this product enough to my friends and anybody else unfortunate enough to have a fence fighting dog with a WOODEN fence. i just set the boundaries 2 feet from my real fence and it worked fantastic. He was CURED!",dogs,3
"Unit works perfectly for the cat food I wished to contain instead of all of the spillage from the open large bag. The plastic is a little thin, so I took the advice of another reviewer and put a small strip of wood across the inside to support the unit a little better than just the thin plastic. I am very happy with the unit.UPDATE- 2years later and the unit has been excellent!!!I would definitely recommend this unit!",cats,2
"I had previously been an Oster A-5 Devotee, but purchased these at the recommendation of somebody I worked with who groomed dogs.They are quiet, they stay cooler than A-5's, they fit your hand better, and they have plenty of power.

"A few years ago I adopted an adult female cat who ""claimed"" me when I visited the shelter. I had another female cat whom I had aquired as a 5 week old feral kitten and who has never forgotten her wildness. She is nervous, edgy, skittish, and at times, nasty. The new cat basically began to torment the first cat and finally after a year of introduction attempts (which ended several times in the first cat being wedged into a bed frame peeing)I returned the other cat to the shelter which was difficult and made me feel like a failure. After a few years I decided to try again as the shelter was overfilled and cats were getting ill. We have a great relationship and history with the shelter, so this time we asked to ""foster"" a cat to see if it could work out. I also chose a male cat who appeared to be the laziest and least interested in me.I bought a diffuser without high hopes. I had tried sprays without success and heard mixed reviews on the diffusers. I had the diffuser in the room for a week before I tried an introduction. I also had both cats ""play"" in seperate rooms to the point of exhaustion before every introduction and gave a lot of treats each time they saw each other. I also had them play with toys while in the same room. It has been over a month and the cats appear to be tolerating each other. There is some ""charging"" but it appears in play and both cats take turns chasing one another, then resting in the open. They sniff one another calmly and now my crazy wild cat doesn't even hiss, she just walks calmly away instead of constantly hiding. It is a miracle for us.While I realize the gender and personality of the new cat may help, as do the treats and playtime, I truly believe the diffuser works for the following reasons. First, within two weeks I noticed my first cat stopped destroying my couch. I had used the double sided tape and she would claw OVER it! She no longer claws the couch. Previously, she clawed the couch for over a year! I wish I had realized the diffuser might work BEFORE she wrecked it! Second, my nervous cat now wanders all over the house and actually interacts with us. I still have to be careful that she doesn't take a swipe at me, but honestly I feel like her personality has improved though she never be a cuddly kitty. Third, when the diffuser was about day 25 I noticed the irritability of both cats increasing. I put in a refill and two days later the cats are mellow and laying in their respective beds sleeping.I have read other reviews and I know it doesn't fix everything for every cat. I don't know if it would have fixed my first problem years ago, but now I wish I had tried. (I kept in touch with the shelter and the other cat found a wonderful home...but I still have regrets).The prices on amazon are the best. I wish I had purchased through them before the expense of a pet store. Also, Whisker City sells a more affordable diffuser that takes the Comfort Zone product, which is what I did. I don't think it lasts 30 days...more like 25 for me.I hope this information helps someone. Good Luck!",cats,2

"This thing is totally ghetto and cheap. Kitty Bear is a slender 7-8 lbs, and when he turns around inside it, he always knocks the top part off. It isn't very sturdy at all. When it starts to topple, Kitty Bear gets scared and runs. There have been a couple instances where he ran out before his dingleberries completely dropped. Good thing I keep this thing in the laundry room, which has a tiled floor.The fake plant is totally lame. I know a lot of people say to replace it, but seriously, why even include a plant that cheap?Lastly, this thing is a serious pain in the butt to clean. This thing gets nasty unless you use liners, but then that makes this become an obvious cat box, defeating the whole purpose of having it in the first place! It's now in my house with no top at all. Total waste of money.I guess it does it's main job though, which is holding cat litter and waste. 2 stars.",cats,2
"Both my cats just love this toy. As soon as I got it I put it on door and BAM they were there playing like mad. The feathers on tail didn't last but a few minutes, but that's ok.

His favorite is the poultry flavored one - we haven't given him the edible bacon flavored yet, but he's smelled it and went kind of bonkers :) The puppy takes them everywhere - to bed, outside, in the car. They are great for chewing. It would be nice if they were slightly fatter, but that's because he likes to chew on larger things (arms, for example). Overall, a great product/kit for puppies - with great variety that keeps them interested!",dogs,3

"After hearing about so many cats finding this water fountain irresistable, I bought one in February. My cats like running water from a faucet as much as the next cat, but neither one of them ever seemed to take a drink from this new fountain. I ran it for about 6 weeks, but the reservoir water level didn't go down and I never saw them drinking from it. I finally disconnected it for good and am getting rid of it. It's just a little too large and a little too noisy to keep around for another try.",cats,2

"I love this fountain. The following features are fantastic:1. The reservoir. There is a clear plastic reservoir on the back of the fountain that is easily removable and that you can fill in the sink. I have two cats that drink a ton of water, and I felt that with the old fountain or their bowls, I was constantly filling up their water. With the reservoir, I only need to fill it once, maybe twice per week. It also avoids the loud gurgling sound when the water is low and the pump is running.2. The plastic pet hair filter. Who knew that adding an external small piece of plastic filter would do so much? If you look at the fountain, to the right on the bottom is a plastic piece that filters cat hair. It is easily removable and I quickly rinse this off every week. It avoids having to empty out the whole fountain and clean it as often as I had to with the old one.3. The removable pump. You can completely remove the electric pump from the plastic pieces. This is great because I like to soak the fountain pieces in soapy water to keep it clean. You don't have to worry about the pump or cords because you can completely remove it.As I noted in the review for the Drinkwell Original fountain [...], the pumped stopped working due to hair clogging. I also had to refill this fountain daily.If you're wanting to do a pet fountain for a cat or small dog, without hesitation I highly recommend this product.",cats,2

"I never buy anything online without a lot of thought and research. I was in between buying this, or buying one of those furniture cabinets with boxes inside. I decided on this because it was a lot less expensive and takes up less room. I've been looking at this for awhile and read a lot of reviews about it, both good and bad.Here's my feedback:GOOD:- my BIG cats (15lbs) fit in it great! It is so much easier for them than the ""jumbo"" sized box we used before.- suprizingly looks good (I was expecting it to look cheap because the material is cheap, but it's not bad!)- super easy to keep clean. (wide openning lets me scoop easily, dumping litter out and then soap/water is a quick clean overall- affordable!!!!- works anywhere (doesn't take up much space, can angle openning in any direction so you can change your mind where to put it, unlike the furniture boxes)- NO ODOR",cats,2

I used to be able to find them in the store locally, but when I couldn't I freaked, and luckily found them on Amazon. There is something similar at the local store, but they are not of the same quality or of course cuteness, which definately counts. I sprinkle catnip all over it and when one side wears out, I flip it over, and the extra toy that comes with it is great. This was drop shipped from the manufacturer and the only complaint I have is the way it was shipped, it could have been packaged better, but luckily there was no damage. I currently have two in reserve and will be back for more! Everything from this brand is fantastic and top quality!",cats,2
"My Bengal loves this bed more than any other bed she's ever had. It gets so warm in there that she doesn't come out for hours at a time.

However, I was feeding her exclusively with the feeder ball and it got to a point where she would bat it around until all the food was out of it then walk out of the kitchen without eating any of it. I don't know if she was in a tizzy about something or not but I stopped using it for a while and try to switch it up now. I also had to get 2 of these because there would be times that I couldn't find the ball because it would end up in the other room. Now I have two cats and I use them both at the same time and they're pretty good about keeping them in the kitchen and surprisingly not leaving a mess, as of lately anyway.",cats,2

"Food falls into the water area (especially being in such close proximity to the attached food bowl) and gets everything all slimy/greasy. To top it off, it was very hard to clean and refill.The cord's ability to detach from the a/c adapter was helpful, but would have been better to have it disconnect from the unit itself so there wasn't a long tail to trip on or gather up to get to the sink.Looks great and the cats did drink from it, but they did not seem to prefer it to the tub or toilet. I couldn't keep them out of the bathroom until I put out an ordinary water bowl that can easily be rinsed every day.Both cats got giardia (completely treatable, but bad times in the litter box); I wonder if was from this fountain.Very attractive, but not worth the hassle.",cats,2

I have been using Frontline Plus on my dogs for the last 9 years. But when I purchased this box of Frontline Plus it did not control any fleas at all. My doggies are covered in fleas and they are scratching and licking themselves raw! It is so bad they are having to wear e-collars. I really don't know which product to use now since Frontline Plus is the LEAST TOXIC of all the flea medications on the market today. I called Frontline and asked if they had changed their formula but the customer service rep said they hadn't. I told her I thought I had received a bad box because it had always worked in the past. She didn't seem to care! So I returned the unused tubes. I will not longer recommend or purchase Frontline plus ever again!,dogs,3
"This collar finally ended all of my frustrations with my 2 yr old mini schnauzer! Before I had the collar, my dog would bark uncontrollably at any person or dog she saw whenever I had her outside. It got to where I felt like I had to hide if I saw someone walking our way so she wouldn't cause a scene. It was so embarrassing! This collar has helped out SO much! The first time I put it on my dog and she barked and got sprayed, she tucked her tail and hid under the bed. I felt really bad because she was shaking so badly. She actually got over that incredibly quickly and I was able to take her on a nice walk that night without any barks! She has learned that she can growl and bark very softly and it won't make the spray go off, but I'll take it. It's nothing like the constant shrill barking she used to do! Sometimes she will forget she has the collar on and will bark once, but the spray gets her and she immediately stops. It's just so funny because you can tell she wants to bark so badly, but she knows she can't! If she starts barking while she's inside, all I have to do is show her the collar and she tucks her tail and immediately stops. This collar is unbelievable!",dogs,3
"I have a 3 year old min pin who is about 1' tall so when I got this, I thought for sure out Houdini would get out of it right away (it's only 2' tall). So I covered it with a dark sheet to throw him off a bit. To my surprise, he didn't even want to get out! He stayed in it all night and even when we left the house! For our family, it was a good investment to contain him and to keep him safe from his own curiosity. I will say though, without the top, it is super open and for a taller dog, very easy to climb or jump over. The plastic is solid but for a chewer, I'm not sure it would hold up too long.",dogs,3

The unit has lights to let you know when it is on (blink green) and when it is sending the ultrasonics (red). But since humans can't hear I can't verify if it is working. It senses when the dog is barking and shows the red light blinking. But it does not seem to slow down the barking. So it could be the dog is just immune to the correction and loves to bark. The unit is moderately low priced and was worth the experiment to see if this would work.,dogs,3

"This product got my attention because not only is it environmentally safe, but also can be put on the pets along with their bedding. The only down fall of this product was that it is only half full. I am not exactly sure if the product worked. We got a flea problem after getting a new dog so we bombed some rooms and gave them all baths. This didn't seem to work completely so we got some spray and powder. It looks as though it took effect, but we still get the occassional flea.

"As far as this type of toy is concerned I think this one is the best. The plush toys are high quality, there are plenty of holes to dig through, and my dog loves the toy. It's not her favorite, but she loves to shake out the squirrels a few times each day. I think it's a good toy to help dogs with their confidence as they have so many squirrels to bully and they have to stick their head inside to get to them. Also, because the toys are inside, they have to rely on their noses and intellect with this toy more than many other toys. As Cesar Milan would say, the nose is the number one sense for dogs. Any training/toys that gets them to use their nose is letting dogs learn to be dogs. You hide treats and many other things inside the log other than squirrels if you want.",dogs,3

I tape them over newspaper which is over plastic which is over ceramic tile that leads to the doggie door. Works great. I haven't had any problem with the plastic backing being porous like another reviewer-maybe there was a small hole.

I just wanted to give a heads up on what it does not work for. If you are looking for a good shampoo for a nice healthy coat, this is it. I would recommend it for that reason.",dogs,3
"I tried various hairball products in the past, but my cat did not like the taste of any of them until I found this one. My cat has very dense fur, and is constantly grooming himself. He enjoys the company of my other cat, and loves grooming him too, but this has resulted in problems with hairballs. Petromalt Hairball Treatment worked very well, and has eliminated the problem. He's much more comfortable...sleeps better too and so do I..lol.",cats,2
"This style doggle is much nicer than the old goggle style doggles but, unfortunately, they don't fit as well as the old style doggles. The old style rested around the eye sockets but these sit on the bridge of the nose so the straps must be placed very strategially on your dog's face and if you have a small dog with a pointed muzzle you will have a heck of a time getting these to sit properly and stay on your dog. I've given up trying to put these on because they won't stay on my dog very long. The old style doggles stayed on her much longer with much less problems.",dogs,3
"We now own three of these heated pet beds, and if the reactions of our cats are any indication, these are the best things since catnip! We put one inside a pet carrier wrapped with a blanket, with another one on top of the carrier. The third one is in a patio chair, and all three see heavy use on a daily basis. We really appreciate the washable fleece cover that comes with each pad, as well as the metal coil surrounding the electrical cord, which keeps the cord safe from a pet that might otherwise chew on the power cord. The pad itself is wrapped in a plastic skin which repels water, in the event of direct exposure to moisture. For outdoor use they work great, which was the main reason we bought them. However, they work fine inside, as well.Power usage is minimized by a weight-sensitive switch inside each pad that only turns the heating element on when there is a pet actually sitting or laying on the pad. The element heats up pretty quickly, but does not get terribly hot. With the plastic skin and fleece cover, it proveds a very welcome, very comfortable warm spot on cold days.For the price, these are fantastic, though this model is for smaller animals, like cats. Even so, these will do just as well with small dogs. If you need something for larger pets, you can't go wrong with this brand. We give this item an easy 5 of 5 stars!",dogs,3
"Can't change the rating, I now give it 1 star.I used Canidae for the last year and my dogs thrived on it. Now their coats are dull, they scratch and lick all the time. Loose stools...and they only eat it if they are hungry.I understand about the commodities going up. But, I would have rather they raised the prices rather than switch ingredients without warning.Now, I gotta go hunt for another brand that is good for my dogs, and not part of the original recall.It may just be time to buy a cow!",cats,2
"Got this, thought it would be a great way to make cleaning the cat box easier for the kids. The problem is that the cartridges are expensive, and I felt that quite a bit of the liner was wasted when you had to pull it away from the roll, and cut it on the cutting blade inside the container. Then you have to pull more out and knot it, and hook it inside. When you tied off the filled bag, almost double the length was wasted. If you empty the container when it is full, it adds up. Would be best for someone in an apartment or who had difficulty getting outside regularly.",cats,2
"I ""rescued"" a HUGE lab mix (notorious for massive shedding issues) when my friend lost his house in a short sale. I agreed to hold the dog for 30 days. A year later and my friend still didn't have a place for him, and I didn't really have room for him in my house or my life. I tried to integrate him into another family, and did so at a VERY slow and gentle pace. But on his first over-nighter he wigged out, and tried to let himself out (behavior he never exhibited before) to make his way back to me.I've finally come to terms with the fact that I have to keep the dog, but I just couldn't get past the fur - EVERYWHERE - including my eyes, nose, mouth, and food. When relaying this to a friend, she told me they'd tried several undercoat brushes/rakes over the years, and then got this as a gift. They said they used their best, similar product first, and then brushed again with The Furminator. She said she was floored by the results. I immediately got online and found an INCREDIBLE deal on Amazon (not available at the time of this writing).Time is my most precious commodity, and I don't have ANY to spare. I've had the product about 2-3 weeks. In the first week I brushed him for 10-15 minutes each day. I was floored, too. Now I brush him 5-10 minutes about 3x a week, and I'm still pulling out handfuls of dead, trapped undercoat, but less and less as time goes by. I know I'll never be fur-free, but I'd brush him for 20 minutes twice a day to get these results! The dog looks like he lost 5 pounds, and I keep having to make his collar a little tighter (that's where he's really thick and has way too much skin). He hates the heat, we're in Florida, and since using The Furminator, he tolerates the heat better, for a bit longer.As for the negative reviews I've read? I'd have to guess that people are applying too much pressure. It is kind of hard to fight the urge when you see how quickly the fur accumulates on it (consider the ejector model?), and how you can keep brushing the same area and still not come up empty. But too much pressure (you really only need to hold the brush handle parallel to the animal and steer), or not making any effort to hold the skin in place if the fur is tangled, would undoubtedly be uncomfortable for any pet. My dog perks up and follows me when I ask him if he wants me to brush him with The Furminator, and he always makes sure to roll on his back and present even his sparse underside for the pleasure of a gentle scratching.I didn't realize how much I resented that fur. Heck, I've even buried my face in his fur, and didn't come up choking and swatting! If your pet is a shedder, BUY THIS PRODUCT!",cats,2

I have used Advantage for years for my small (fourteen pound) dog and it works better than any other treatment. What I like best is it is only toxic to fleas.

"Our very smart, very small dog, who is a Papillon and Jack Russel mix, really enjoys this toy. However, I find it frustrating that the cube just won't come apart for cleaning as it is supposed to. We actually returned the first one we bought because it wouldn't open, but the replacement cube won't either. The hygiene issue is unpleasant for the owner--but I guess it's not such a big deal, since from the dog's point of view, clean things are less fun than dirty ones!",dogs,3

"After I received this product I quickly realized that $62 was too much to pay for it. Easily assembled, no directions required but very very flimsy and unsteady. Once I put the cages in it did sturdy up a bit more but it was a challenge to get the cages to fit. The bars were not cut correctly so they do not fit as snugly as they should either. The bottom tier is too close to the floor for any birds comfort so a firm piece of plywood works great for a shelf. If you do not have to worry about the cage being bumped by dogs or kids it is great, but it takes very little to shake the whole thing and ""rattle"" the birds with it.",birds,0
"I was disappoint in this product. The Pet Pen is a wonderful bed for my little dog chico who weighs about 6 pounds. I had another one, but it was destroyed from a bursted pipe in the ceiling. This one was to replace the destroyed one because Chico loved his bed. When I received it the packaging was great and it had a nice bag for the pen. However the hooks on the bottom was very hard to get down and one on the top will not latch into place. I needed this pen immediatly so I couldn't send it back. I would recommend this product even though mine was broke. I could have sent it back, and Amazon I'm sure would have made it right, but I didn't have time.

"What does not bother me to much is that it is not made well, it has an opening on one complete side of the roof as the roof was obviously cut to short.I purchased this house because I thought it was soooo cute.I should have remembered how much use the piggies make of the 3 entrances of the other houses. They have one opening on the very right corner of the front and a hole at the side/back.Love the way the roof looks. I don't know about your guinea pigs or animals you purchase this for. Mine are no jumpers or climbers since they left childhood. All they can do is nibble at the border.They sometimes like ""throwing"" their houses around and change the position of it. That's better with entrances at more than 1 side. Or 2 of them are in one house each sticking their head through one hole.Also, I am not sure though that they are bothered by that (or anything really), they have no hide out as the whole inside is visible from the front. In the other huts it was possible for them kind of not to be seen and hide from you.My recommendation is for a hut with more entrances that are also offered here.I am sure the measures were stated in the description...this ""large"" hut is smaller than my other ""large"" huts.So..........totally cute but not accepted by 3 out of 3 piggies. And I get it.",bunny rabbit central,1

"This is a fantastic head collar! I've been using them on my huskies for over a year now, they are still holding up with little signs of wear and tear, even after washing them many times. Now my friends, neighbors and family members are using them. If you haven't tried this head collar, please do, its a lifesaver (and backsaver) if you walk more than one dog at a time-even if you only walk one dog at a time! Depending on your dog and how stubborn they are, it will probably take a week of regular walking for them to get used to it, but after that it will be smooth walks from then on. I now can walk three dogs at a time with no problems. And its amazing, when you put the head collar on the dog knows not to pull. The great part about the gentle leader as opposed to the halti collar is that its small-medium-large options instead of several number sizes, makes its easier to fit on your dog. As long as they don't have a huge head, the medium size fits about all dogs 30-60lbs. Spread the word!",dogs,3

"I am elated that I chose to disregard comments claiming sharp edges and poor quality workmanship. For the price, I was willing to stay flexible in my impressions, especially since my dog had already been trained to have some crate etiquette. Definitely a pleasant surprise to have received a product that does its job safely and efficiently.Pros:* It shipped flawlessly. Both the outer and original packaging were free of dings and tears.* Easy assembly. I didn't read a word of the instructions.* NO sharp corners. It has been perfectly safe for my pup so far.* Locking mechanism started off a little stiff but it loosened up and makes for easy open/close, especially for those of us who are crate training.* THE DIVIDER. I've already adjusted the crate's size since purchase and I can't express just how useful it is for crate training.* I don't need it since my puppy isn't one to soil her bed, but the removable pan is a nice touch for those who do. Stays securely in place.* Travel-friendly. Collapses in nothing flat, with simple but sturdy clips to hold everything in place.I haven't seen the advantage to it but the second door is nice. Half pro?Cons:These are limited considering the price point. Most are improvements rather than criticisms.* I have three cats. Beware, the spacing in the wiring is quite large and has led to some teasing/toy stealing. I also have a Sheltie and she is able to put her snout all the way out. For a more aggressive puppy, I'd be wary of things you leave in and around the crate. I found my sweetums chewing on a box flap. Easily fixed, nonetheless.* I wouldn't say the locking mechanism is great for the most mischievous furry locksmiths out there but, once again, my pup is quite content being in her crate so she hasn't tried it. Gets a little too loose with use. I could see it being opened from the inside with no sweat.* It includes a detachable handle but it sucks royally. I just carry the thing with my finger through the spaces. They're big spaces any way.* The joints that hold the sides together look flimsy. Maybe it's just my preference but I feel like it might impact VERY long term use, especially if you take it on the go. Could fall apart.* The paint chips easily. I'm not one for aesthetics so I could care less, but I figure it's worth mentioning for someone with a mouthy animal.I like detailed reviews, so there you have it. What I will say with my final word is that this product is DIRT CHEAP and does it's job without a hitch, hence my 5 stars. This review is based on three weeks of use, give or take. If you're looking for a fancy premium or heavy duty product to take with you from place to place, I'm not too keen on this being the item for you. Its workmanship is not reliable in the long run unless you collapse it any time it is moved. The look is very basic and shouldn't improve over time considering the paint issues. If you're like me and looking to crate train/provide a little den for your loved one, look no further. It's got the divider, the casual portability factor for when you go on vacations, and it's safe for one real small price tag.",dogs,3

"There are so many tablets!! It's such a great value! I It has all the vitamins that your dog might need. I love that it's made in the USA and I would recommend this product for most owners looking for a health boost.I personally do not like this product (anymore) because my dog is now much healthier and eats very healthy. She doesn't get any corn, wheat, soy, or by-products in her diet. I don't like that this has corn in it. Of course this is such a small amount when analyzing a dog's full diet that it's actually not such a big problem, especially for others. When I had fed this to my dog I had crumbled it into her food. Sometimes I would give it to her directly but she wouldn't take it from me unless I gave it as a reward for doing a command (i.e. &#34;sit&#34;). So you might have to make your pup work for this &#34;treat&#34;.There's not much wrong with this product, but be aware that there are already a lot of vitamins in most dog foods - so it might not even be necessary to buy this. You might be better off buying a raw food boost supplement, or simply upgrading your dog's food. Make sure that the ingredients excludes wheat, soy, corn, AND by-products, otherwise it is NOT really an upgrade in quality.Good luck - and I hope your dog stays healthy! :)",dogs,3

"I purchased this for my dog just after he went blind with cataracts. We were going out of town and I was having difficulty using a leash for him so I thought this would be better for him while we were staying at a hotel. It took a couple times of using it before he bacame safe in it since he did not understand where he was when placed inside it. After adjusting, he loved the security of it. My one complaint though is that he does not like his collar attached to the clip as it gives him a tight feeling around his neck, so I unhook him from that but keep the other clip connected so that he does not try getting out. He is only seven pounds but since he does not realize that he is above the ground, I have to be careful. I wish I would have purchased this a long time ago, he would have enjoyed it and then made the adjustment easier before going blind. Also when using this when the weather is warm, he tends to get hot. I now use this when I take my dog into work. I have a long walk from the parking lot so this works great!",dogs,3

"This product is a lifesaver!!!!!!!!!! I have a 1 year old Great Dane who suffered from atopic dermatitis. I also give himAnimal Essentials Plant Enzymes & Probiotics, 300 Grams, which has helped ease his gut issues (skin issues = infection = antibiotics = gut flora whacked out). However, I give most of the credit to this product. He became extremely picky with his food after the infections/abx vicious cycle took over. For his skin issues/itching he was on tons of anti-histamines (hydroxyzine 50 mg BID) with little relief. I started using this product and BOOM (over the course of a few weeks BOOM)!!! His appetite is back, his coat has totally grown back in and IS GORGEOUS, his itching is down to a minimum, and he is off the anti-histamines. You can actually smell a hint of the salmon oil in his hair... it's awesome!! It is a much better smell than skin puss or medicated creams. I like how this also lets me know he's assimilated this product. The funny thing is, if I buy food fortified with salmon oil, he won't touch it. He wants the legit thing. I also was previously giving him a GNC fish oil pill BID. I think canines need a much higher concentration of omega-3's, which this product provides. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I have friends that have seen the difference in my dog and have bought this product for their pups.

"I'm a dog trainer and I bought this to train my neighbors dogs in the apartment next to me to stop barking. IT WORKED and it worked well! But keep in mind that every dog is different and may require different tools and methods to train, so this device may not work on every dog. But it has worked well for me. Here is the trick to using this tool to its full potential:- Point device at barking dog- say the word ""QUIET"" and hold the button down until the dog stops barking, even if the dog stops for just for a split second, then release the button.- Praise and/or reward the moment the dog stops barking.- Repeat, repeat, repeat.The dog will soon connect the word ""quiet"" to the noise and will understand that the noise will come soon after unless he stops barking. HOWEVER, as with all dog training, this will only work if your timing is quick. You only have a 1-2 second window to let go of the button when he stops barking for the dog to connect the cessation of the noise with the cessation of his barking. example",dogs,3
I gave this to my English Bulldog for his 2nd birthday and he loves it. He carries it around all day and always pokes his paw in the holes to feel the ball inside. He is very determined to get it out but surprisingly this ball is so durable that he has not yet and he does not seem anywhere near close to getting it out either! Finally a toy that can keep him busy all day while I'm at work!,dogs,3
"I have been giving this product to my dog for 3 years.My vet prescribed it 1st, because DJ has a lot of arthritie.DJ was a new dog in just a few weeks.She still can't jump on the bed, but jumps/dances around on her back legs and chases the cat every day.DJ is 17 years old, but you would never know it by her behaviour.Can't get it at the vet any longer. They want to give drugs, like human doctors.I am a natural health nut, and prefer that route when available.I would give this to my dog at any price.KAT",dogs,3

"I bought this for a 2 yr old 14G Oceanic Biocube and it's only been installed for several days but I've already seen improvements on the way my corals behave (couldn't wait to see long term results). I couldn't speak to the quality of the bulb or it's reflector since this is my first halide but the light output is bright white with a bluish tint which is exactly what I wanted. It now has the shimmer effect that only halides can provide and gives my tank that ""under the sea"" look and feel. A biocube owner would know that the actinics on the stock lighting isn't nearly enough to bring out the natural colors of the corals so the halide is an unparalleled upgrade IMO. To some, 150W might be an overkill for a 14g tank but for $50 more, I'd rather have more than less lighting and am very content with it, along with my newly acquired crocea clam. It's connected to a timer that provides 9 hrs of automatic lighting per day. Positioning and adjustments are definitely a plus. Remote feature of the ballast is nice to get it out of sight. My light sits about 10 inches from the water surface and my tank temp tops off at around 80 - 81 degrees on a 9 hr cycle. Although, I'm sure I'll have to deal with evaporation issues for going topless.Now on to the problems of the product. The biggest problem with the JBJ K2 Viper is the plastic used for the bracket that attaches to the back rim of the tank is way too brittle for the weight of the fixture. The 2 backplate screws can be easily overtightened by hand resulting in the brackets snapping as it did in my case...BUMMER! This issue is definitely either due to a design flaw or low quality material used. There should be some sort of a torque regulator that will at least restrict you from overtightening to avoid breakage. I just remedied it with two 2"" C clamps which made it much, much stronger. Having the clamps at least gave me the confidence that I wont come home one day to find the light inside my tank. In fact, I'm actually glad that I found out about the issue while installing the light because I'm sure it would have happened at one time or another anyway when it would've caused more damage. Reinforcing it with even just a 2"" clamp right off the bat is highly recommended. The arm of the light seems flimsy but it shouldn't really be a problem if you're careful around it or wont be moving it very much. The bulb housing also gets extremely hot and will burn your skin so putting on the black metal grill that came with the light should be used. The gear box is huge and very heavy! I hope that says something about the quality of ballast JBJ used.In all, if you have an option for a reasonably priced pendant style of lighting (which I don't) then I would strongly recommend considering that. The JBJ K2 Viper is not a bad product but not the best either. For tight budget like mine, I'm okay dealing with the issues mentioned above.",fish aquatic pets,4

"The post itself is very sturdy, and holds up well against the scratching of my 2 fairly large cats. The only downside I have against the product itself is that the material on the post doesn't really compare to what my cats typically like to scratch (the carpet, the sofa cover).It's taken about 2 weeks to get them interested in the post, and I finally got them into by laying it onto its side and covering it in catnap and just letting them eventually get their nails in it. As a tree, it didn't initially attract them.It's a good item for people like me with cats who scratch what they shouldn't! Recommended!",cats,2

"I got this water feeder for my cats. They had developed a nasty habit of knocking over their usual water dish (the normal automatic water feeders you get at the pet store). I spent 2 or 3 days cleaning up huge water spills from the carpet, including soaking it up with sham-wow's and then getting out the hair dryer to dry it completely. It was a LOT of work! Needles to say after doing that a few times I went looking for a better solution.I don't know what made them to decide to start messing with their other water feeder, but this little water bottle has been an awesome solution! Although I didn't know if they would use it at first(because they've never seen one or used one before) I figured we'd try it out. I cleaned it out with soapy water, filled it up FULL, and put it on the side of a cat carrier that's set up in the corner. It was the only place I could set it up- there are metal bars on the carrier to allow kitty to see out when you take him to the vet, and the water feeder is designed to be used on a cage or crate.Anyway, it works! The first time, I got down on the floor and ""showed"" them how to use it, and after that they were off to the races! We love this thing.The only negative I have with it is that it's kinda hard to figure out how to hang it. I just now realized that I was doing it wrong! Oh well, it was working for us the way it was. But I'll try to follow the directions on the package (what an idea, huh?) and see if I can't get it more secure and easier to take out and put back in.All in all, though, it's saved me a lot of work and my cats don't have to go without water. Yay!",dogs,3
I ordered this and was surprised how much I got for the price! That part was a great deal. As far as it working I haven't notice any difference yet. I am going to continue to use it because I may not haven't given it enough time yet. I have 2 cats and 1 dog so fleas are always a problem and I hate using chemicals on them and prefer something natural if possible. I have heard positive remarks about garlic and brewers yeast so like I said I will give this a few weeks more and then do a follow up review..,dogs,3

"This item is not so much a pet bed as a mat, and a small one at that. If you are considering it for a dog, before buying it, you may want to measure how much space your dog takes up when resting. For a single cat, or even two, the size is good.The top side is a fluffy surface. The reverse is plain, with closely spaced small dots of rubberized material. To some degree, it stays in place--especially if placed on top of a non-slippery surface, such as an upholstered piece of furniture. On something slippery, it tends to buckle and/or wrinkle as the animal moves about.DOWN SIDE",dogs,3

"Gone through 3 of these with my big male. First one was a 10"" version with the rope that they don't seem to make any more - so we downsized. Like the last reviewer experienced, our dog got the rope untied on the first one of these we bought - but we haven't had the same issue since.We keep buying them because he absolutely loves this thing and it's big enough that it takes a few months for him to trash it (and even then he still likes it). He carries the 8"" version around like a tennis ball. At first it is a bit tough but in about 2 days he has them broken down and flexible enough that he can pretty much just crush it like bubble gum.He loves the squeak of the rubber (no noise maker - just the natural sound the rubber makes when he crushes it). No moving parts or built in squeekers to break (he kills any of those in minutes).Be thankful if the rope does come undone - because if you keep this toy outside that rope gets pretty nasty. My wife hates this toy in the winter. It gets pretty well pockmarked and can hold some mud (plus the aforementioned rope). Her biggest issue is that our dog likes to offer it to her by pushing it at her legs (especially if she's wearing light colors).Definitely not for every dog. We have multiple shepherds and only our largest male (115 lbs.) plays with it - but it is one of his two favorite toys - no doubt about that. Works for us but I would only recommend for large dogs with a big bite.",dogs,3

"I've owned this carrier for years now. I LOVE the color. I also like how you can unclip the top and door to clean (or get your cat out for the Vet to examine). When I first purchased it, it seemed a bit small for my cat, she is 9-10 pounds. However, she never has any intrest in standing or moving around when she's in there because she's always so frightened. She can turn and face the back of the carrier easily which is comforting to me. The top has a chamber to keep treats (or a leash for a dog). Mine came with a small water/food bowl that clips to the door bars, but I never use it. This carrier also sells beds that fit perfectly in them, which my cat loves. The only downside is, like many carriers, it can get very awkward to carry. I live in New York and do not own a car, so when I take my cat to the Vet, I have to carry her (walk and/or on the train). I have to constantly switch hands because the bulk of the carrier becomes uncomfortable to walk and hold her without swinging it around. I am thinking about purchasing a rolling carrier/backback for this reason. Also, it's impossible to get an animal in if it is wearing an E-Collar (or ""Cone-of-Shame"") You have to unhinge the top and put the animal in instead of just putting it in through the door. Regardless, It is a very sturdy, reliable and cute carrier. I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase it.",dogs,3

"This toy worked great until one day I forgot to put it out of Bouli's reach after we finished playing ""catch"" with it. Left with it on his own, he almost instantly tore up the hollow part. My advice for this toy would be not to leave it around for the dog to chew on. It's wonderful for chasing and water play, and as others have said, the crazy bounces are good for hours of fun.

"If you want the convenience of buying puppy training pads in bulk and want a great price this is a great choice. These Wee Wee brand pads are by Four Paws, the same company that makes the better quality pads sold at Petco and the other big box stores.These pads are 22""X23"" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer ""odor control"". They work very well.Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were ""improved"". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.What does matter is the price and the convenience of buying in bulk. These pads are quite satisfactory.",dogs,3

"I have to take two cats on a 900 mile trip. Last year I had three cats in three carriers, yowling for hours, very unpleasant even though two of the cats were in large carriers. Then I saw the pet tube. I decided to go for it, even though I couldn't see how I would get my two cats, who don't get along, into it. I thought one could ride in a carrier and take turns with the other. But I may have found a solution, I made a barrier that I've slipped between the two cushions (sold separately but necessary for a firm surface for the animals to ride on). I took them on a test drive today. My loud yowler stopped after a few minutes, he was busy looking out the window. Eventually he fell asleep. My other cat complained, but the more I drove the less she complained. I think this will make my trip much more pleasant than what I endured last year. I also bought spill proof bowls for water. They will have to use the litter box when I stop to take a break myself...but last year they refused to relieve themselves for the full eight hours I drove each day, so I'm not sure that putting a litter box in with them when I stop will be a waste of time or not.",dogs,3
"I first saw this toy at a home I pet sit at occasionally. The adult golden retriever there absolutely loves it and the toy has been there the last couple of times I had so I figured it would be pretty durable. I bought a large one for my 2 2-yr old Springer Spaniels and while they loved it it only lasted for about 15 minutes before it got its first hole. Its a really soft rubber so it doesnt slam against my kitchen floor like other treat toys which is nice, but it also made it easier for the dogs to bite in to it. It dispenses treats well enough to keep them intersted and is nice because you can squeeze different sized treats in it to make it harder for it to come out. If I didnt have pups that like to chew things apart it would be a great toy, unfortunately it just wasn't durable enough for my dogs so I'm only giving it 3 stars.",dogs,3

"I've ordered this item 3 times now. The first couple of times, I received a box which said that the color of the unit was walnut, but the product inside looks nothing like the picture. The color is way, way closer to the espresso version. Much darker than the picture.I called Amazon, and they said that they would go manually inspect the remaining units to figure out what was going on and correct the problem. They said that the item would be marked as ""under review"" on the site, and that a week or two later it would go back to purchasable, at which point I should buy it again. I did. It was ""almost-espresso"" again. I gave up and put it together. I've had it for a few days now.Once assembled, it seems ok--during construction, the materials felt sort of cheap, even for particle board / composite furniture, so don't tighten anything too tight when you're putting it together. I would also recommend using a hooded cat-box inside, as some other reviewers have mentioned that cat spray produces warped, ruined (and smelly) particle board if you don't know it's there and leave it sitting for too long. The assembled size surprised me",cats,2

"I purchased a very similar bed (same style and size made by PetMate - different print on it) from a local PetSmart store. My dog loved it so much, I bought a second one to put in another room. I feel good that there's so much padding in it to keep her up off the floor, and the colorful prints brighten up the room and hide any dirt. When we travel, one of these beds is bound to come with us! The only down side I've noticed so far is that the stitching only seems to last about one year so I'm looking for a replacement now. I was also disappointed that PetSmart only offers these beds occassionally as a promotion. I'm so glad to have found it here!!",dogs,3
"I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them. At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats. That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one. She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling. However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats. I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me. I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds. However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats. Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats. I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES. I do not know how I made such a blunder. Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.

"I purchased this for use in my 40 gal. African Cichlid tank. I use it to drive current flow at the substrate level. I set up a custom undergravel jet system, using PVC pipe. By providing continuous circulation/flow at the substrate level, it dramatically cuts down on your need to vacuum! It also aids in helping to circulate oxygenated water, thus eliminating any need for a bubbler. I have used the Rio 17HF in my 55 gal. with excellent results, so wanted to have a similar set up in my 40 gal. that I set up for my daughter's room.To use it in this particular application, you need to configure the PVC pipe setup to with as little turns as possible, to avoid any loss in head ft. pressure. Similar setup when doing a sprinkler system - less curves = better pressure and stronger flow of water.Highly recommend the Rio line of HF, vs. their regular lines (non-HF). Much stronger and reliable. Also by purchasing it through Amazon Prime, I got free two-day shipping.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I was sceptical about if this product would work. After using it for a month I am convinced that it does (and at a better price then comparable brands). We have two labs who have really bad gas. Before my husband and I started giving them these tablets they would pass gas numberous times in the evening when they were inside, every night, it was unbearable. Now, it's every once in awhile (maybe once a week). We would like to get them on a better diet (I was told to feed them a higher quality food w/meat as the first ingredient) and feed them separately so there is no competition and inhaling their food. I am sure glad I started with these tablets though as they help tremendously! The dogs love them. They think they are getting treats. :)",dogs,3
"If this fence didn't work, the dog was going to have to go! We live near the mountains and have lots of wildlife around, and our super friendly puggle Ruby couldn't resist chasing the deer and/or going to visit her friends. Housetrained, great with kids, and wonderfully sweet-but we couldn't keep her in the yard! It was just too hard--with three little kids, a husband who travels, and lots of running in and out the door I just couldn't chase her through the mountains one more time.My husband insisted on trying this fence before I found her a new home. I figured that if it didn't work we'd just send it back. He had it set up and calibrated to the correct radius in an hour. It's been a little over two weeks since the first training session and I am pleased to report that Ruby stays home in the zone all the time! I almost cried the first time I saw her get shocked, but she has since learned that the warning beep means it--and she stays home in the yard. We followed the training schedule quite closely but it wasn't hard at all. I figured that as much as Ruby loves other dogs and people she would run right through the charge, but she doesn't--she stays home.Definitely worth a try. The only drawback is that our neighbors/her friends are sad to not get to see her anymore. The best pet investment we've ever made.",dogs,3
"This litter box is a very ingenious design and couldn't be simpler in concept. Our two cats took to it straight away. After using it for a couple of weeks both ways (manually scooping every day and/or rolling every day) I'd summarize the pros and cons this way:Pros:1)Very, very easy to use - a quick roll and roll back and your done. If you REALLY hate scooping litter, but don't want to deal with the cost or maintenance issues of an automated system this is a great compromise.2)Big enough for a couple of cats - they don't seem to mind sharing it.Cons/things to pay attention to (all fairly minor - no fatal flaws):1) The screen is a bit coarse and some of the smaller pieces that you might catch with a scoop slip through.2) If the contents are very ""fresh"", you can get a bit of a mess on the screen, which then needs to be removed for cleaning (timing is important).3) Urine clumps stick to the bottom, so you'll often need to peer into the box and use a scoop to ""pop"" any reluctant clumps loose.4)Clumps towards the back of the box can fall behind the tray as you roll them into the tray - then you have to retrieve them, yuk. Just tilt everything towards you a bit as you are rolling and that won't happen.5)With the screen in place the ""floor"" area in the box is reduced a fair bit (by 1/3 I'd say.6) If the latches aren't all engaged you will get a spill out the back when you roll it. I check to make sure every time.",cats,2

"This carrier was great - successfully transported the family's 15 lb cat on two airplanes for a total of over 1000 miles. It was a little small, but the cat was comfortable for the majority of the trip, especially once the ""Rescue Remedy"" solution kicked in. [Search for this if you're traveling with your pet - it really works!] My only caution is that if your pet has front claws, they may be able to rip the mesh to shreds and escape, but this was not a problem for my de-clawed cat. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to others.",dogs,3
"AquaClear BioMax is a hollow ceramic cylinder, several ceramic pieces are packaged in a net bag. They're messy & need to be rinsed off before placing the bag in theAqua Clear 110 Hang-On-Back Power Filter, UL Listed.These BioMax pieces help increase the biological water conditions for your freshwater aquarium while reducing ammonia & nitrite levels. Hagen recommends to replace the BioMax pieces every 3 months; however many people rinse it off in their aquarium water when they perform water changes. I've been told that some people never replace these.(The AquaClear HOB (hang on back) multi-stage filtration system is replaced in stages and one at a time. Never replace the carbon filter, foam filter & biomax pieces at the same time.)By the way, I'm a fan of Hagen aquarium products.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I have a cat who does not like other cats. The &#34;adopted&#34; outdoor cat now has a warm place to go and I cut a hole in a clear plastic sterlite container for an inclosure. She wouldn't go into an igloo or anything she couldn't see out of. She spends the winter on my deck but out of the elements. It heats up when she is sitting on it, so you don't waste a lot of electricity. I had purchased this before but it only worked for two winters.

"I am very pleased. The reflective stripe is a great idea and will come in handy when its dark outside. I bought this for my doggy and my friends doggy, who is a Min Pin. I sometimes chose between the Xtra small clothing and the small clothing for my Chihuahua. It depends on how the clothing is made and the cut of the clothing. I am glad I chose the size small. Its not too big or too small. The hood fits well with agjustment and my doggy can go outside and do his business without any restrictions. I highly recommend this product. Sometimes xtra small clothes fit my dog and sometimes they dont I just use my best judgement even though its an online purchase, I have gotten pretty good with choosing the right size.",dogs,3

The second time I used it he quickly bit open the toy and the sack of grains inside, spilling them all over his bedding. Hoping he did not ingest them- glad I have a vet appt. today. Our pup is not a destructive chewer and is not teething either. Do not give this toy to a young puppy- much safer to let him adjust on his own. Also did not stay warm long and is very small- much smaller than he is at 12 weeks old. I wish I still had the box as I would return it immediately. What a terrible idea.",dogs,3

"We had tried another remote spray type collar to stop our dog from doing certain behaviors. She was not phased by this type of collar. This collar has been a success on the lowest setting. I felt bad about the idea of ""shocking"" our dog for bad behavior, but tried this out on my own neck and on the lowest setting is nothing more than a tingle. With this device it is like we have a new dog. I can have her off the leash and she does not run away like she did before. The negative tone alone will correct her 85% of the time. I highly recommend this. It has made a huge difference. We even tried it out in the creek and it was waterproof as described. We could not be any happier. My wife said she would have paid double for it because of how it has changed our determined dog.",dogs,3

I would definitely recommend this product if you have a dog that loves to play fetch.",dogs,3
"I have to agree with a previous review by M.Brooks. I took her after her video review and went to the local target and bought a 20 gal plastic bin. I traced a circle in the lid and used a utility knife to carve it out. The nice thing about the bin I bought is that there are latches on the side of the bin that snap onto the lid, so you don't have to worry about the lid falling off. My 7 month old cat took to it immediately and christened it with her poo before I could even get the lid on, lol. All in all, I paid 7 dollars for the bin and 2 dollars for the utility blade. That's a total of 9 dollars! Pretty darn cheap. Another plus is that in this way you can at least test this style box on your cats and get the Clevercat box once you know your cats will use it. Better than getting stuck with a 30 dollar storage bin :)",cats,2

"My dog eats his breakfast kibble out of this ball every day. It takes him 15-30 minutes or so, and he seems to enjoy his kibble more when he gets it from the ball than when it's put in his bowl.However! It does have a learning curve. You shouldn't just shove kibble in it and then leave it around, unless you want either a chewed-up ball or an ignored toy. Here's my suggestion on how to get your dog started.-If you dog is a chewer, do not give this toy to him unsupervised! It's a medium-soft vinyl, not meant to be chewed.-Do not treat this ball like a ""toy"". It's a mobile food bowl. Don't leave it out when your dog is done with it. Don't put it in his toy bin. Until he knows how to use it, provide it only before mealtimes.To get started:1. Put a couple of extra-good treats inside (just enough to smell), and have a bunch of extra treats for you to hand-feed. Show the ball to your dog (preferably before a mealtime) while you hold it. If you use a clicker or marker word, mark and reward every time the dog noses or paws the ball. Do NOT reward teeth-touches or anything that looks like chewing.2. Once the dog reliably noses or paws the ball, put it on the floor. Keep giving treats from your hand for nosing or paw-touching. If the dog insists on biting it, take it away for 5 seconds.3. Don't give him the ball for more than 5 minutes the first 5 times. Let him play with it, and then feed him from his regular bowl.4. Once your dog understands that nosing/pawing is ok but chewing is not, stuff the ball full with medium-good treats and a few super-good treats. Filling the ball up will make more treats come out faster. Reward him from your hand for nose/paw pushes if no treats come out every 10 seconds or so, but by now your dog should be figuring out that the treats come from the ball. Stop while the ball is still half-full--as the ball empties, the treats come out slower, which can be frustrating. So the first few times make it super-rewarding and leave him wanting more. Don't let him get frustrated or bored with it.4. Once your dog ""gets it"", start adding kibbles. Leave a few ""bonus"" treats inside to keep things interesting. As your dog gets proficient, he will be able to empty it really fast! Keep an eye on him to stop chewing the ball itself and to help your dog out in case the ball rolls under furniture. Always take it and put it away when your dog is done. He may leave a few kibbles inside, which is fine--the last couple are hard to get out.",dogs,3
"Cats are way smarter than the mat. You need the whole floor covered with scatmats to have any chance at all of keeping them out of a room. They will either jump over one or two wide, or run across three or more. As soon as I bought multiple mats, the power supply was constantly activating itself. Soon after it died. It was replaced at no charge. Unfortunately, the replacement is doing the same thing. I'm boxing the whole mess up and sending it back. I don't even care of I get my money back, I just want someone to know I am darn unhappy with their product.",dogs,3
The Petmate Deluxe Edition Wire Kennel has all the extras to make your life easier. The dog probably won't notice the difference.

"I sent this to my daughter...No she's not a dog; she has a dog, which makes me a Grand-ma, kinda. Well, I don't know what scent you spray on your product but as soon as the package arrived--before it was opened-- my 'grandson' went wild. He loves all of his outerwear but this stylish coat makes him so happy. He's a clothes whore like his Mom and Dad. The fit is perfect and when you pop the collar he looks like Ashton Kutcher or Will Smith. The shipping date was swift and the garment was as described. Good job, kudos to the designer and the production team! This product has a lot of whimsy yet it isn't foolish. It is functional but not too boring; a classic look that easily transitions from office wear to an early night on the town. OK--that's enough!Again, we love it and I want to recommend it but I selfishly I want my 'grandson' to be the coolest kid on the block--and the envy of all the dogs at the park.",dogs,3

"You can't imagine how skeptical I was about this litter box. Even with all of the glowing reviews, thirteen years of being dominated by feline overlords had me convinced that this product could never be as useful as people were claiming.I'm so glad I was wrong.Do you have multiple cats like me? You'll want this box. You know how you've had litter boxes stashed in every reasonably available space in your house so as to accommodate the incredible amounts of poop your furry masters generate? Well, you could arguably get away with having just one of these in the house provided that a) your cats never, ever have to use it at the same time and b) you are the type to rush over and roll the box every time one of your overlords uses it.So get two, even though you COULD get by with just one.Gone are the days of making the endless rounds to scoop multiple boxes... the disgusting drudgery of dragging poop-filled bags through the house to collect more. No more weekly struggles to empty multiple boxes, scrubbing them down, hauling around heavy bags of litter to fill/dump, etc.This litter box eliminates all of it.A quick roll of the box and all the yuck falls neatly into the tray. A quick roll back in the other direction, and a bed of clean litter sits waiting for the next visit from the true master or mistress of the house. Tilt the box backwards, and it's a simple matter of pouring in new litter as needed. Tilting the box forward into a trash bag, and you've just emptied it for cleaning - something you will rarely need to actually do.You can dump the contents of the tray into those little blue scented diaper baggies that most of us probably used with our kids. Those work perfectly... tie them closed when they're filled and toss them in the trash, same as you did when your kids were little. No fuss, no muss, no smell.It is actually shocking to me how clean this box stays. It's almost counter-intuitive. You're rolling all those clumps of waste around inside the box so as to get them in the tray... it must get filthy! But it doesn't. I'm not sure if this is because the loose litter sort of &#34;scrubs&#34; the box as it's shifted around inside or what... I can't explain it and neither can my engineer husband. We're baffled... and pleased. I border on being OCD about cleanliness and germs, yet I don't feel the least bit discomfited by this littler box.We've not yet had any trouble with clips breaking... if that happens, I'd follow another reviewers advice and get a couple of bolts and butterfly nuts to secure things... or I'd just buy a new box - the price certainly isn't a barrier given how much we're saving in litter AND time now.This was worth every penny and more.",cats,2
"OK, let me explain this. For years I just kept a simple liquid crystal thermometer stuck on the side of my tank with no problems. I got this to help regulate the maintenance and liked that it had an electronic thermometer. One day the alarm started going off and indicating a high temp. So I turned the thermostat down. This kept happening and happening until I was keeping the lid open and turned down the thermostat all the way down just to keep the temp in the right range. Over time my fish started acting strange and my normally healthy tank started to look sickly and even dead. All this time, my old liquid crystal temp was registering 72 degrees, while this thing was reading over 84 degrees. I knew I had turned my thermostat all the way down and that this thing was likely broken and decided to start relying on my old liquid crystal thermometer instead of this thing. It still works ok for monitoring the regular maintenance i.e. weekly water changes, monthly filter changes, etc., just don't trust the temperature because it doesn't work and may potentially kill your fish.",fish aquatic pets,4

I didn't buy this from Amazon, but I'm compelled to comment here because it's such a fun product.The banner is made from a kind of synthetic terry cloth which is very colorful, very stretchy, and very resilient. The banner is firmly attached to a flexible polycarbonate wand which gives great freedom of movement and can handle quite a bit of tension. And, as some others have mentioned, this toy stimulates your cat so much that she'll happily play with it ENTIRELY on her own, and for long periods of time.*whew* just got both hands back...And, the deciding factor",cats,2

"My dog has a thin wiry coat, but she sheds all year round. I purchased this item hoping it would help, but apparently she doesn't have the right undercoat for this brush. I do get a fair amount of fur out when I brush her, but it is similar to a regular brush. I was initially disappointed with my purchase as I was hoping to decrease shedding and the amount of fur that is all over my house and car. I just didn't think it worked as advertised. But I gave the brush a try on my mother's dog and there was an astounding difference. One stroke of the brush down her back and the brush was full of fur. After about 10 minutes I had a large pile of fur on the ground. I'm considering just giving her the brush since it works so much better on her dog's fur. So make sure your dog actually has an undercoat, otherwise the brush is not useful or worth the money.",cats,2

"I was a bit skeptical of an electronic collar at first but I am sure glad I purchased one. I have a black lab puppy with a lot of energy named Mazie. I had trained her to come but she made up her mind when she wanted to listen and when she wanted to dart off the other way. We live by a busy highway so once she started to not listen I would have to take her outside on a long leash. After doing some research online I came across this collar and read all of the wonderful reviews and decided to purchase this collar. After a few days of training Mazie while she was on a leash along with the collar on she responds very well! It doesn't matter what the distraction is outside, I call her and she comes running. Now after she got the hang of the collar I barely ever even have to use it anymore. Walks used to be her pulling me and now she stays right by my side, so enjoyable. Other people that are walking have commented on how well-trained Mazie is too. I would highly reccomend this product to anyone that wants a well-mannered dog =)",dogs,3

As someother reviewers noted, it was a bit noisy at first. And if it isn't kept fullenough, it will be loud. But mostly the gentle sound is like an indoorfountain should be.

"We have a 2 year old Rottweiler that would scatter her dog food (Blue Buffalo) all over the floor when eating. After reading about the benefits of Wild Salmon Oil for dogs and researching the different brands available, I decided on the Alaskan Bear Treats Natural Wild- Alaskan Salmon Oil for Dogs in the 32 once pump bottle. Our dog loved it immediately. She got excited the first time she smelled it being squirted onto her dog food while it was still on the counter. When I put her bowl down she ate all of her food immediately with none dribbled on the floor around her bowl at all! The pump bottle works great and the oil doesn't smell very ""fishy"" at all. A 32 oz. bottle lasts us about 2 months giving 4 squirts in the morning and 4 in the evening with her food. That is what was recommended for an 90 lb. dog. We also give her Vitamin E to help her absorb the nutrients in the Salmon Oil. To me it is well worth the expense which I feel is minimal for a product that gets her to eat her food without a mess and has helped to make her coat shiny and soft. I have read that Salmon Oil is also good for heart and joints. Rottweilers often have hip problems so I am hoping the salmon oil will help with that. Too early to tell that at this point since she is still young.",dogs,3

They are now very happy sleeping on them and the clean up is a snap. I put a towel on the beds for extra comfort and then shake the towel outside and push the beds aside to sweep under them.

"i got this after my kitty was diagnosed with brain cancer. we were going to the vet at least once a week and, being a slightly (ok, really) agoraphobic cat, it was a very stressful time for him. i got this in the hope that it would help him to relax more quickly when we got home but it actually seemed to make him more nervous and upset. he absolutely refused to go near the room i had it in and, after a few weeks, i had to get rid of it. oh well. guess it just wasn't his kind of thing.",cats,2
"This is an amazing tool for grooming our dog, and cats too! We just adjust the pressure on the different pets - labrador retriever, short hair cat and long hair cat.

"It worked as they said. A dog peed on my car (huge pee). After treating it immediately with carpet/upholstery cleaner, no way. Nearly a month later, the odor was disgusting.

"The Martingale collar is an enormous improvement over standard choke collars.I've been training dogs with these for decades and they simply trump old fashioned choke and pinch collars in every way.Renowned dog trainer Justin Silver, uses them exclusively as seen in the new television show ""Dogs In The City""What makes the Martingale so effective and safe is that a sharp correction is never needed. There's no need to ""snap"" the leash as you would with your standard choke collar. Instead, a simple and quick tug and release tightens the collar around the entire circumference and immediately releases - but unlike metal choke collars the correction is minimal, it wont vary and it releases right away.We have Old English Bulldogs, stubborn by nature and resistant to being ""Bullied"" - pun intended.Working with our 7 month old puppy has been a breeze and the Martingale has proven itself once again an essential tool.BENFITS:* Gentle and effective* Safe you can't damage neck muscle or worse, vertebrae as does happen with choke and pinch collars* Dogs most any size response faster to training with a MartingaleImportant to note - you must use a standard six foot training lead. Never a retractable leash. Retractable leashes have their place and I'm a huge fan of the German made Flexi. However they aren't intended for training nor training exercises.This Martingale collar is well made, adjustable via a high quality plastic buckle mechanism, the metal chain and hoop are high polish chrome and well finished. So they never snag or stop, the movement is always smooth and effortless.The nylon collar is waterproof and wears like iron. An excellent collar, well worth the very affordable price.",dogs,3

However, my dogs are hyper-sensitive bordering on neurotic, so every time the device went off, I ended up with a large Golden Retriever on my lap.

I ended up returning the product for a full refund, and Amazon made that process very painless. Thank you.",dogs,3

The toy has two main flaws though; my dog chews through it very quickly and sometimes eats the plastic material the toy is made out off and the toy leaves blue marks on our wooden floor which need to be cleaned up later on with warm soapy water. Otherwise it's an absolute pleasure to see my puppy chance this toy around!,dogs,3
"Just because it's made for chinchillas doesn't make a it healthy for them. This food has far too many ""treats"" in it. A Chinchilla should be allowed 1 or 2 treats a day...not a bowl full. I would not recommend this brand of food for chins.",small animals,5

If I had tried this out before buying the automatic box, I would have saved the money and bought two Omega boxes instead and still have more than enough to buy a decent cat tree and some treats!It is easy to use. The main thing to remember is to make sure the clips are properly locked in place (you really need to push them as far as they would go in the hole) to avoid leakage.",cats,2
"I have a 19 pound, 9 months old, Shih-poo. We first got him the red kong for average chewers and he chewed right through it and started eating the pieces so we had to throw it away. Then we got the black kong for extreme chewers and we had the same problem. The only difference between them was that he chewed up the black one in only a slightly longer amount of time. They both were chewed up within around a day and we ended up having to throw them both away. This is at least not for my powerful chewer. I would recommend getting a nyla bone instead because he loves those and they are hard for him to chew through.",dogs,3

"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",cats,2
"Unfortunately this toy hasn't made the cut of the top toys for our 50lb lab. He wasn't interested in playing with it alone, so we really only use it to put treats in. That said, due to how big the holes can be (the holes differ in size) we can only put treats that just fit in the large holes, and smaller and they come out so easily. We use the Milkbone Medium sized bones for this. We still prefer Kongs for stuffing treats in though. And I will say that we have had several JW brand dog toys and I guess we should be grateful that our dog doesn't chew on this one because he has chewed through just about all other JW toys.",dogs,3

"Oddly, our 14 week old puppy gets chased out of both her cages by a 9 years old de-clawed cat so he can have them for naps. The cat does have his own bed so this was unforeseen. So to say they don't like them would be incorrect. However, the puppy has dug a hole in the first one. Likes the fluff? So during the day we take it out and put in on the kitchen table so the cat sleeps in it and the puppy gets a security towel and the hard plastic cage tray. The second one is only for when she sleeps at night in our room. Seems to be a magnet for digging regardless but the bolsters are great for her to lay her head on or against. We bought a third for the swap-out wash event should the puppy not make it until we get home. Since it only took 2 days for the puppy to find china, we have not had to use it yet. I really don't know of anything that is going to stand up to a puppy, dog or cat if the try to escape through the floor. Maybe denim? I took off one star though as cages are 24""x36"", not 23x35 which is what these are. That extra inch is where a toy drops into and that starts the digging process.

"We have had this product for one week and our dog is currrently out having a great time chasing squirrels. She seemed to learn the system in about 2 days. Flags were more for us than her. She knows when she hears the beeps to head back to the house. She is better behaved now in the house because she can expend so much energy running and playing outside. She is a bordrer collie mix with plenty of energy. The collar does give some random beeps when in the house, the company said this was due to so many frequencies in the house. Remedied by keeping collar off in the house. I am not at the comfort level of leaving her outside when we are gone, but it has worked perfectly for our needs, which is for her to play and get exercise.",dogs,3
"After trying a few different jackets with lots of fit problems, I bought the X-Small version of this Suede coat in white for my 4lb. Chihuahua. She was getting stuck in the leg holes on other jackets... they were just too loose and bulky. Some others had giant pieces of stiff velcro that freaked her out with the ripping noise to take them off. This product however is absolutely perfect. It fits her small body just right and keeps her nice & cozy on cold mornings. It doesn't slip or impede her movement so she basically forgets she has it on. It even has a hole on back to attach the leash to her harness underneath. The best part... it's super cute & adorable! I can't recommend this product enough for a small dog. I liked it so much that I bought another one in Tan.",dogs,3

"First off, remove the plastic covering the sensor disk! I saw one of these in a friend's aquarium where they hadn't done that - so they assumed the ""safe"" readings they were getting meant their tank was doing great.. not so! I guess they figured it looked so simple they didn't need to read the instructions first, but that's a fairly obvious thing to overlook!Second, this is the exact same sensor material used inSeachem MultiTest Ammonia Test Kit. That test only tests for harmful free ammonia (NH3), but to be honest the test is a bit of a pain with having to time the test.. I never liked pulling it out, having to deal with the tiny little disks in the container, and waiting 15 or 30 minutes for the results.. but this alert is already ready to read (the color scale is not the same however, because of the longer ""exposure"" time).Third, kits like theAPI Ammonia Test Kitmeasure TOTAL ammonia (NH3 and NH4). If you have chloramines in your water you WILL have tend to have false positive readings because of the ammonium formed when you use dechlorinator on your water (such asSeachem Prime. It doesn't mean you water is dangerous, it simply means that the chloramine has been converted into ammonium, and the API test can't tell the difference. I've had my tap water test as high as 2ppm for ""ammonia"" with the API test right after a water change - the Seachem test would show 0. The doesn't mean the Seachem test is wrong or inaccurate, it's just more specific - just like this alert disk.Because of the issue with chloramines in my tap water cycling a new tank is a frustrating experience trying to use the API kit. I would constantly see positive ""ammonia"" readings while I could see my nitrites had spiked and had gone to 0 and I was seeing increasing amounts of nitrates, but using these disks simplifies the process. A partial WC can be done as the disk starts to turn blue in a fish-in cycle (or if you are dosing ammonia for a fishless cycle, you can add ammonia a little at a time until the disk turns dark blue), and the effect can be seen quickly as the disk changes color from blue to green (or even almost yellow). I think it's one of the best products available when you can't rely on the total ammonia readings from the API kit.",fish aquatic pets,4

I read each one of the reviews and even though there were a couple negative ones the positives far outweighed the negative. And, the price was right. I purchased a small, and while it's a little big for my puppy, the velcro straps adjusts well so it's a good fit for her with some room to grow. It's so cute, very well made, and she loves wearing it! Great buy. And there's also an opening for a harness hook.",dogs,3

I think the new cover may only last 2 years. I really didn't expect them to last this long since the dogs are on them every day and sometimes at night, despite having a dog house to sleep in. They are located on a screen porch so they are protected from most weather. Unless they've cheapened the quality since 2005 they are definitely worth the price and the dogs' constant use vouches for their comfort.",cats,2

"Our dog, Charlie, has some allergy issues. As a result, there are certain times when scratching seems to be almost as important to him as breathing. We tried Benadryl (it works but it also renders him listless) and we switched his food to something more natural. The food switch helped but he was still scratching. And though his coat was soft it still felt a bit dry at times.Enter Lipiderm. On the recommendation of someone at the dog park, I bought this and started adding a spoonful to his evening meals. He has had no upset stomach and doesn't seem to mind the taste or texture. I've actually seen him go back after a meal and lick the bowl clean. His coat is softer and shinier than ever and his scratching is reduced from never-ending to on-occasion. We are thrilled and will continue to add this to his evening meal.(Charlie is a Cairn terrier mix.)",dogs,3
"I have a dachshund, who is an aggressive chewer. He loves this toy. He will chew extra holes in the trunk to get the squirrels and will run off with the squirrels, which he also will eventually tear up. However, he will play with this toy for an hour at a time (longer when new and without the extra holes). You can buy extra squirrels to replace in the trunk, but he is happy even with the ones he has destroyed being packed back in the trunk. This is an excellent toy to keep your dog occupied and entertained. One word of advice, if you don't want your dog chasing after real squirrels and barking at them every time they come into the yard, you may wish to get one of the other designs, like the hide-a-bee, which my dog also liked, but not as much. I think dogs are programmed to be crazy about chasing squirrels. I bought this for 2 friend's dogs, and they also loved it. One of them sews the holes back up for her lab, so he can continue to enjoy his favourite game of ""Where's the squirrel?""",dogs,3
"Nylabones ( the non edible kind) are by far the best chew toys for dogs of all sizes. They help keep their teeth and gums clean and provide hours of safe chewing enjoyment.They are also a good chew toy in the house, because they do not have messy dies that can stain your floors or furniture. Everything you give your dog or child, do it so under supervision.I have not had any problems with Non Edible Nylabones, but I would be saddened if I did not supervise and suddenly a chunk to big to swallow safely came off.

"Our large indoor dog is getting older, and she peed on our carpet. First we toweled the spot and cleaned it with Woolite, but even after scrubbing the area and letting it dry several times over the course of two days, the odor was still pretty bad. We headed to the pet supply store to find something stronger, and picked this. Admittedly, a big factor in our choice was that we didn't know much about any of the products, and this cost less than most of the other power products (most of which contained enzymes to ""eat"" the foul odors). The other big factor was that this didn't have any perfumes or fragrances added, as these are a problem for a member of our household.We were amazed at how well this worked. Following the directions, we sprinkled the white Odorzout powder over the problem area, and left it overnight. It said it would work better with a fan running on it, but we tried it without the extra electricity use first. The next morning, we vacuumed up the powder. Hooray--the smell was gone!Since then, we've used it once more when the same problem happened, and it worked just as well. This second time we didn't use Woolite or anything else first. We just toweled the area, let it finish drying for a bit, and then used the Odorzout. The next morning, one member of our household who is *extremely* sensitive to smells could still detect some urine scent, although the rest of us couldn't smell anything. We used the Odorzout a second time on the same area, and then everyone agreed the smell was completely gone.My only concern was whether the area was really ""clean"" after being sprinkled and vacuumed, without also shampooing the carpet with anything. According to the package, the Odorzout ""attracts and traps the gas and bacteria molecules that cause odor, even in flooring under carpet. When you vacuum it up, odors are gone for good."" From what I can tell, that appears to be true. I'll still keep shampooing my carpets twice a year anyway, though!So, I'm giving it five stars because it does exactly what it says it will do, very well. I wish it worked instantly, but at least this fixes the problem overnight.",cats,2

"I first purchased two single bones from a natural dog pet store and paid about $5 to $6 per bone. The bone at that cost was only about 4-inches long. Two at those prices was expensive in my opinion. Since I shop a lot on Amazon because the prices are much cheaper, I found this vendor and bundle of bones to be considerably cheaper than you would find in a pet store. If you buy in bulk online from a good vendor, chances are you will return to that vendor again and again, which is what I do.I first purchased from the vendor on Amazon a bundle of 12 of these larger bones. These are great for my two Labrador Retrievers. If you own this type of dog, you will know that your dog likes to chew. Mine do, particularly my younger lab. Every Saturday, we treat the two to a bone per dog. Both my dogs will spend hours chewing away at these bones. My oldest lab will eventually give up, primarily because I think she gets bored of chewing and usually takes a nap afterwards. But my younger lab will chew and chew and chew.. for hours on end. It's funny to see him with the bone in his mouth later. He always has to have something in his mouth, so these are great options for him.We used to purchase nylabones and other chew toys. Now, we purchase these bones in bulk, saving tons of money on the product and tons on money on not spending for other chew toys that the dogs tend to chew to pieces. Because these are real bones with marrow inside, they have a special meaty taste on the exterior that I think attracts the dogs to spending the hours just chewing away. I also believe that one of the reasons they'll continue to chew at these is because of the ""surprise"" hidden inside the bone.These bones are perfectly safe and a great treat for any large breed dog to chew on. Because they are larger than normal, I would not recommend this size on smaller dogs, like toy dogs. There are smaller bones available by the same vendor for smaller dogs you can purchase. Certainly, any dog that likes to chew will love this bone. I highly recommend these bones to any dog owner.",dogs,3

I like that they smell good, unlike some similarly priced treats, which seems to reduce stinky doggie breath (and I'll admit it, I tasted one... wasn't too impressed with the flavor, but they're not for me!).The only downside is that some of the treats are HUGE, but they can be broken up into smaller pieces.",dogs,3

If I took the bed out and placed it on my red area rug, it would leave pills of white fleece. Recently, my puppy has been vomiting food stuffs mixed with the fleece fibers. Buy at your own risk. I would not recommend this item to anyone who cares about the health of their pet.",dogs,3
"These are a great alternative to declawing and relatively easy to apply if you have a somewhat reasonable cat. If you can cut your cats claws, you can put these on. They are supposed to last until the cat naturally sheds their claws--about four weeks. The problem I've found is, you don't know where in your cat's claw shedding cycle you are when you put them on. Within a week, our cats usually have one or two off, whether from normal wear or getting them caught on something we don't know. So there is some maintenance involved. Still, I would MUCH rather deal with this than go through a cruel declaw process. I was a Vet Tech and I assisted in thousands of declaws over the years. I just can't approve of them anymore.",cats,2

"It does require attention every few days, or even every other day, but don't most appliances? When I was running it with three cats, one of whom was ill, it needed daily attention. However, that attention consists merely of mainly making sure the litter level is okay and seeing if the disposable tray needs emptying. I say emptying because I reuse the trays several times before tossing them. (I line them with plastic bags from the grocery store, as another reviewer has already mentioned). When my older cat, Zeus, was sick and urinating a great deal, I would also need to take a litter scoop and scrape the bottom of the pan daily to get rid of the clumps that stuck, and then just turn the unit off and on again to make the rakes do their thing and remove those clumps.When I had the three cats, before I got the LitterMaid I felt like I was on constant litter patrol, and if I didn't completely change the litter every other day, I had a smelly house. With the LitterMaid, my house never has that catty odor. In fact, people are often surprised that I had three cats.Well, poor Zeus passed away in May, so now we have two kitties, and I don't have any trouble at all with clumps sticking. I did have to exeriment early on to find the best clumping litter for the machine. (I use Fresh Step). And yes, washing the entire unit can be a pain, but this only has to be done a few times a year if you occasionally just wipe the unit with a damp cloth.I would imagine that those who are having trouble with the motor burning out are overfilling the pan and making it work too hard. You use much less litter than you do with a traditional pan. If you overfill and the rakes can't get through, the motor will run constantly trying to clean the pan and eventually it will overheat. That's happened to me a few times when some other family member wanted to be helpful and then added too much litter. I found that when I unplugged the unit and let it rest for a few days, it then worked fine when I plugged it back in. Also, I keep my unit in my laundry room and once I had a flood and the motor got wet and stopped working. A few days later, after it had thoroughly dried out, it was as good as new. Getting rid of all that wet litter was horrendous, but that would have been the case with a traditional pan as well.",cats,2

"We have 3 large dogs (Two rotties and one catahoula). We go through beds all too often as the larger dogs are rough on them. I normally buy bedding from the big wholesale stores but at roughly the same price I wanted to give these a shot. They are essentially giant pillows (not bolster beds as other reviews mentioned). They might have a bit too much filling in them but I think it will compress. Most importantly, the dogs seem to like them.",dogs,3
"I have two boxers - a 60lb highly food motivated male who literally drools when I reach for these ""cookies"" and a 45lb finicky princess who thoroughly inspects anything offered to her before eating it (or not). These Blue Dog Bakery Treats are hands down, the best dog biscuits I have found... And both of my dogs LOVE them.Even though both dogs are on grain free diets, I make Blue Dog treats the one exception because of the clean, all natural ingredients. Each box contains a variety of flavors and a few sizes -- I have been searching for larger sized dog treats, and these are perfect. As a bonus (for me) these treats don't smell like dog food - they actually smell pretty good.I put these on auto delivery so I always have them on hand... And I break them into smaller pieces for use when training (my male is a recent rescue).I will point out that there was a quality control problem with the last batch I ordered. Instead of their usual rich colors and crisply defined shapes, three of the boxes I've recently opened contained paste-y blobs formed into biscuits. They smelled the same and my dogs didn't seem to notice a difference, so I kept them. So, they still earn 5 stars in my book - but that will change if this problem persists. If quality control is lacking - that could be an indicator of more significant issues. For now I still highly recommend.",dogs,3

My dog (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) HATES to wear dog boots - he walks like he is constipated and looks at me like I am the worst puppy mommy int he world. Then I wanted to try a new product so I bought Musher's and I LOVE IT! I really thought that it would stain my carpet, but it did not. It conditioned his paws as well. He was ok with me putting this on his paws too and did not give me a hard time. When we went for our walk, I felt good knowing that his paws were protected from the snow, salt, etc... Although I did wipe his paws when we came back into the house to make sure to take any salt or debri off. I would HIGHLY reccomend this product!",cats,2

While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood. My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love!

"I have a 3 year old mixed breed dog (I think he is part chow and part retriever) who thinks he is a pulling guard. I'm 6'3"" and 380# and he would jerk me around like a ragdoll on our evening walks. I would come in feeling like I had just run a trial of the Iditarod! I saw this harness on Amazon and ordered it. After about two weeks use it has made a world of difference beginning with the first walk. Whereas before I was the only one in the family who could walk him now both my wife and daughter (14yo- and no-they are not my size!)can walk him on a leash. It is well made with strong wide nylon webbing and is a cinch to put on once you get the mental picture of how it is supposed to go- remember D ring in front, red strap on top, black strap under front legs. I just undo the black strap and it slips right off. My wife refuses to read the directions and puts it on so that the D ring is on top (but that's another story!) She claims it works.

"I have an aggressive chewer who can be destructive if she gets bored. I was skeptical about this product but thought it might be all right. Many of her toys get ""lost"" under furniture. This ball is great! (I did not have any problem with the rubber smell that someone else wrote about.) I break up pieces of fruitables, newman's pnut butter treats and dehydrated chicken and put them in the ball. They will fit in the ball full size but it seems to work better if I break them in half. Daisy gets frustrated when she wants to play and has no one to play with. This toy has been great for her. It does not always give her a treat, she has to roll it around for awhile until it lines up just right. It looks like she is playing soccer with it. She pushes and kicks and runs after it. It is a little noisy but it is much better than her standing on my chest when I am trying to sleep. She would much rather play fetch with me but the treat ball is a good substitute when I can't play. I also have a tug jug for her. It is a good product but she tends to flip it in the air and let it fall on the ground to get treats so it is a little noisier.",dogs,3
"I have a Maine Coon cat with the softest, finest, fluffiest hair I've ever felt on a cat. I have a regular brush (kind of looks like a hair brush) that does an okay job on his coat, and a slicker brush that does nothing (I think his fur is too fine). I saw the Furminator advertised at a local pet store and decided to do a little customer review research because I was intrigued. With hundreds of 5-star reviews here on Amazon I decided it was worth a try--we've been getting LOTS of hairballs this summer! I took the negative reviews into account, too, and decided that this tool would probably help out a little bit but not produce the mountain of fur shown in all the pictures and videos. Well, the Furminator came yesterday and (in my limited experience with it) it totally lives up to its hype! Yes, you will have fur flying everywhere and it will be a big staticky mess, but all that fur will no longer be on your pet (or on your carpet in the form of a hairball). My husband sat with me and pulled the hair off as I brushed and that contained everything just fine. Several friends of ours have already placed their orders!",cats,2

"I have owned this for about a month now and I am quiet disappointed. The dog does love it, so in that aspect it was a success and that is why I will give it 3 stars. The squirrels do have just about the most annoying frequency of squeakers in them, so we instantly destroyed those in all of them. The dog could really care less as she just likes to chew things and throw them around. The squirrels need to be bigger first of all as it takes the dog less time to get them out then it does for me to find them and put them in. There is no challenge there and I highly doubt my dog is super smart as she has failed to display that attribute in other aspects of her life.After the first 15 minutes of owning this, the dog had already removed the leaves on the trunk which then are a slight choking hazard, I would just remove them when you get it to prevent the hazard. Within the first week she had torn open and removed most the stuffing from two of the squirrels. After a month we only have one hanging on for dear life. The trunk, minus the leaves, remains well in tacked. Even before the squirrels were gone we abandoned stuffing them inside the trunk, and committed to stuffing other larger toys in it that actually provide a challenge and mental stimulation.Pros:+Dog loves itCons:-Not built for dogs (most squirrels have been chewed up in a month)-Leaves are choking hazard-Most annoying squeakers I have owned to date-Not a challenge for dogs to get ""hidden"" squirrel outOverall, I will still give it a okay 3 star rating, but I do not recommend buying this largely due to its lack of durability and challenge.",dogs,3

"Although I do wish companies would go the extra mile and create a spectacular product rather than a ""it'll do"" product, this product is, for the price, a good deal.

It was the kind advertised a million times on the television, and it was not only cheap and tacky looking, but far too low for my tiny Yorkie to reach the top of the sofas. And, to boot, it was the exact same price as this set of steps, plus tax. After trying and failing with the Petsupermarket steps, I paid closer attention to the height of the steps vs. the height of the sofas. Since this was the only set of stairs that reached about 23 inches, I ordered this set. It does reach even my highest-plumped-up sofa, and it is far better constructed than the Petsupermarket set I tried and returned to the store. The price is great, the steps do the job perfectly fine. My Yorkie was fearful at first, but I prodded him along, and after just a few tries, he now flies up them (goes down them a little more carefully, but gets it done, and as they aren't terribly wide, they do fit without much inconvenience.

He scratches at his neck and, well, everywhere A LOT less so there are fewer places for the hot spots to get inflamed. I'm investing in 6 mos worth, we think it is the best for our dog. Also, our walking trails have ticks and he has not had one since using this product. Highly recommend.

After 2 hours of inspecting every single o-ring, and filter component and trying to get it to pump correctly I've given up. Some forum postings suggest that the product may be defective, but if there are so many people with the same problem, there is something wrong with the product, not the users. I strongly suggest you read about this in other sites before you decide to purchase. As for me, this one is going back to the seller.",fish aquatic pets,4

Would be great for a small dog or any dog who does not have separation anxiety, but if your dog freaks out when you leave and hates to be in a crate, I would not suggest getting this; they WILL find a way out of it.

I liked it...until i read the ingredients on the package. Pine wood is the first on the list. one pine is toxic to rats,mice,and generally all small rodents (including guinea pigs) so if they happen to chew it they may get sick (my because some say the processing of the pine kills the toxic oils). But the big problem is, if and when they pee on it, it will cause fumes that WILL make your pet sick. i do not recommend this o anyone with a small pet. get an igloo for guinea pigs or hammock for rats,ferrets ect.Pros:They like itspaciousCons:it will make them sick",bunny rabbit central,1

"Set this up last night. Assembly was quick and my only addition is that I sprayed a bit of catnip on it. Just found one of mine hanging on it just as the picture shows. So far they're loving it and it appears to be very sturdy. Not thrilled with the look of the MDF, but I can likely stain or paint that. I would like the base to be a bit thicker though.... it may be perfectly sturdy for the long haul, but it looks less substantial than I would like. Would be 5 stars with a thicker base and with visible parts being wood, rather than MDF. But the cats love it, and that's the most important thing.Here we are into April and my furry lunatics are still having a blast with it. And I almost never need to yell at them for clawing the furniture or carpeting any more.... now if only they made one that was even taller.... my biggest guys don't quite get the full stretch that the others do, and a couple of the smaller ones like to climb it so much that I wish they had more to climb..... If they made one with double the height (even though that would mean a much larger and heavier base), I'd likely go for it... the furballs would be THRILLED.UPDATE -- Just as an FYI -- it is now January of 2013 and the cats are still beating this up.... yes, it's a bit worse-looking for wear, but it's still holding up and still being used daily by kitties who clearly love it.",cats,2

She took to it right away - I use the belt lead almost as short as it can go and with the lunge-buster. Took her about 1/2 a block and then it was like a regular lead for her and both my arms to run for me! Hiking is more fun and the clips make it easy to allow her off lead but get the lead back on when near others. I don't care to clip it together and allow the lead to hang from my waist when she isn't clipped in but it wraps around my waist well to stay out of the way. Others have commented on the quality of the clips. I have used it about a dozen times and my pup is not a tugger - we haven't had any trouble but I can see how tugging pups could challenge the design. She was pretty good on a lead before using this. Not certain I would recommend for lead training on an adult pup - would be great for lead-training a little pup or for those already decent on a lead. If this even interests you slightly - GET IT! You will love the freedom of not holding a lead in your hand while walking / running / hiking with your fuzzy pal.,dogs,3

at last -- a solution for pet hair that works! i have two domestic short hair tabbies who produce copious amounts of hair. they suffer from hairballs and are constantly throwing them up. i saw this tool on home shopping tv and instantly bought it. it is fantastic and gets both the top hair and the undergrowth off. my catties love it! they love to be groomed now as it does not hurt them the way other brushes do. i was amazed at how much hair came off them. plus it is very gratifying to do this for your pet. their coats come out beautiful and soft. you can really see the difference on them. well built and durable.

"I have 3 cats in my house, and whenever something upsets their delicate balance of power, Feliway is one of the things I always turn to. As I've learned more about cats, I've come to understand that when a cat has a behavioral problem the cat isn't being bad, she is merely reacting to a stressful situation in the only way she knows how. Sometimes the cat is sick and needs medical attention, but in many cases it's because of something her humans did to change her environment. Cats absolutely loathe change, and things that seem small to us can set them on edge.Feliway helps by gradually making a cat feel calmer and safer. It works best if you can start using it before the stressful situation (such as bringing in new furniture, something that always upsets my older kitty), but it also works to help smooth over unexpected stressful situations. For instance, one of my Bengals, who is also the alpha kitty in the house, broke her leg, and this caused quite a bit of tension in the house. Even though she was at the vet for just two hours and didn't even have a cast, her departure and subsequent return was very stressful for the other two cats. I can only surmise that she smelled funny after visiting the vet and getting pain medicine and that they could detect her injury. The other two cats started bickering between each other to establish a new Alpha, but once they realized the injured cat was still around and not too injured to maintain her territory, their relationships became very chaotic. The other cats were suddenly terrified of the Alpha. After about two days of Feliway, I can see a visible difference in the cats and they are able to be in the same room now.I made the mistake of not having a reserve supply of Feliway, and I was forced to buy some from PetSmart. It's insanely expensive there - $50 for one diffuser and one 48 milliter bottle! Just getting the refill bottle is $30. After having built up my supply of diffusers (thank you, Amazon) I can now buy the 6 pack refill bottles. It's still expensive, but $80 for 6 bottles versus $30 for one bottle helps save a lot of money for a product that I know works for my cats.One thing that I noticed this time around is that the diffuser (Comfort Zone brand) seemed to be giving off a vapor that looked alarmingly like smoke. I plugged it in first thing in the morning, and light was coming through the window, and the diffuser was on a wall that was dark brown. I emailed their customer support and they responded:""The product uses a warming plate to release the pheromone from the liquid. The product is similar to a burning candle in that it melts that paraffin wax base in the refill. The steam or vapor that you see are indications that the diffuser is working.

"We have a Standard Poodle. This comb is perfect for working through the hair and making him look like a beautiful ball of cotton :) I am really impressed by how nice the comb is to grip. It's really solid and sturdy. The comfort of the handle is really important, being that it takes a while to work your way through the masses of hair that a large, fluffy dog has! It's teeth aren't so long that it's hard to handle, nor are they so short that it is difficult to reach the base of the hair. And the teeth on the thing are thick and sturdy, so they won't be bending out of shape. I order a lot of things through Amazon, but never leave personal feedback. I am so impressed with this comb, that I had to leave a note. I am ordering another this week!",cats,2
"I had tablets from the same brand that I liked better. The larger pills came in a bottle that was easy to reach into and the number of pills was easier to keep track of for my situation.

Now i have to give my dogs 5 tablets a day and it's like getting aspirin where you shake out too many, put some back and I have to ask my roommate, did you give them 1 or 2 pills last feeding, urgh.

"I got the Kong Zoom Groom more because our cat Clyde just loves to get a good massage than for it's grooming capabilities. Clyde is really enjoying the Kong. We previously had a glove with little rubber spikes all over the palm but after several years of use it finally rotted out and fell apart. This was a great replacement. Because Clyde will typically try (vigorously!) to rub his face on whatever we are using to brush or comb him, I tried to find alternatives to brushes and combs with metal teeth. The soft spikes on the Kong meant I could just hold it for him to rub his face on it -- which made him supremely happy. Brushing in a more circular motion helps create the static that causes the fur to stick to the Kong - no real issues with fur flying around that some other reviewers had mentioned. Overall - Clyde gives this one a big paws up.",cats,2

He is now instigating play himself rather than wait for us, he plays for longer periods of time and we're now adding more exercise for him.

"This water fountain is great. My cats (a long hair and short hair tabby) were a little skeptical at first due to the bubbles, but got used to it in less than an hour. I love how much water it holds - I only have to refill it every week and a half or so. The air pump is noiser than expected but it's no louder than the refrigerator so it's easily tuned out. The only time I've noticed it being too loud was when it got knocked on it's side until I moved it right side up.The air nozzle knob that controls the air bubbles doesn't seem to have a wide range of pressures and is stiff to turn. After finding a tolerable level for my cats, I left it alone to ease my frustration. Cleaning is a breeze (I just clean it with a regular soap dispensing brush)and I haven't noticed clumps of hair or food congregating in the bowl like I did with an ordinary standing water bowl.

"So our cat has a problem. She likes food. Alot. She likes it so much that she'll happily gulp it down till she's way too full, then throw up all over the place. I made the mistake of picking her up once at the wrong time; it was like some sort of cat fountain. A Mt. Vesuvius of cat-like proportions, if you will.This behavior started as she entered adulthood. Several re-occurrences made obvious the fact that it was not just a passing phase. So of course we took her to the vet (always good to check!), whereupon she was given a clean bill of health. Alas, it was not an issue solved with a simple pill.And so began the grand experiment. We tried her on wet food, tried feeding her on different types of dry food, tried placing a ball in her bowl to force her to eat around it, tried placing the food over a wide area so she had to track every little piece down, and finally ended up feeding her extremely small amounts throughout the day (which while effective was largely unsustainable). We were ready to give up and consign ourselves to having giant piles of cat vomit splattered about the house like a live-in Jackson Pollock painting. Not pretty!Finally, I found this ball, this wonderful device. It worked perfectly, slowing down her eating so that the vomiting became a rare problem and was far smaller in size when it did occur. We did have some trouble trying to figure out how to keep her food from covering the floor when she ate, and finally settled on an extra-large dog bowl. I was so happy that the cat could now enjoy her meal without going kasplooey. This is an awesome invention, and I only wish I had found it sooner.",cats,2

"My sick kitty (bladder infection) went wee on my couch several times. I tried three other products and all helped some, but none eliminated enough of the odor that we couldn't smell urine when coming into the room with the couch (at first they'd work, but slowly the smell would get worse again). So, in a last ditch effort to avoid having to get rid of it, we decided to try X-O. Just as with the other products, I used a needle/syringe to inject the solution into the cushion and the back (our cushions are not removable). I used a 1 part X-O to 2 parts water for this. After injecting it, I poured the mix on top of the cushion to give it a good soaking.So far, so good. It's been over a month. The product's odor was a bit overwhelming for a day or so, but just as the mfr states, there was no odor once dried. Also gone was the majority of the urine odor. If I put my nose right next to the cushion, there's still a hint, so I'm thinking I may need to reapply, but when I sit on, or next to the cushion, I cannot smell it. At first I worried that perhaps I'd just gotten used to the urine smell, but I've asked both friends and family if they could smell anything nasty when they walk in the room or when they sit on the couch, and all have said they can't (and I know, for sure, my parents and at least two of the friends would not have been shy about saying there is a stench!)The only downside is, my dark green couch now has dark outlines along the edges of every area where I applied the solution. We knew this was a possibility going into this, but hubby and I decided that discoloration of some kind was preferable to having to either live with the smell or getting rid of the couch. And, I'm not entirely sure that if I were to now try to clean the couch that the stains wouldn't go away, particularly since the fabric didn't fade. But even if it had, it would have been well worth it.After my success, I applied this to the carpet at my mother's house (no discoloration or staining occurred) where her kitten had taken to going poo in a few spots along a wall when she first brought it home. We used the same ratio for the mix and just poured it onto the carpet and let it soak in. The kitten has not reoffended since. She now does her business only in her litter box.********Update",cats,2
"I love the Good Dog Training Collar and let me tell you why. It looks great and unless you tell someone, most people will never know you are using it to train you pooch. It is very user friendly, no hard sizing issues. The links stay together very well and this is important. I had one early on that the links would disengage and the leash would be dog less, without warning. I called the company and they said a batch had manufacturing problems so they sent me two new ones. That was 5 years ago and same collar is going strong with problems at all. I have used it to train my Mini Schnauzer since he was 6 weeks old and he still wears it each and every day. We remove it only when he will be alone or sleeping overnight. He knows when it is on him and behaves like he should. That is why people who meet him love him because he is so well trained.

"I started my betta off in a two gallon tank and searched all over for a low-wattage heater that wouldn't be too much for the smaller size to handle. The reviews on this all seemed to be very good, so I gave it a shot and I am not disappointed. My first night with it I was a little skeptical because it seemed to take a while to heat up, but the next morning I noticed the temperature sitting steady at about 80 degrees. The normal temperature in the room prior to having the heater was low 70s (74-75) so it does exactly what it says on the packaging.True, the heater doesn't have a temperature setting, you just have to put it in and monitor the temp yourself, but with a thermometer I bought for less than two bucks, it certainly works just fine for us. I probably wouldn't use it for the five gallon tank I'm upgrading Proto to, since I think it's just strong enough for a two gallon and smaller, even though it advertises for up to five.

It is very funny watching her run around and challenge you to play with the trunk as she does with the Hide a Bee Beehive as well.

"I agree with the last two reviews. Urine Gone works great for me. I to had to make sure that I saturated the area. When I first used it I only sprayed the surface of the carpet. When I lifted the rug there was still a stain. I repeated the process on the pad and then again on the carpet. I can now say that the stain and odor is gone in both spots. I also agree that it is safe to use on any material. If the stain is really set in you may have to treat the area 2-3 times. I was ready to give my dogs up because of the spraying problem of my male dog, but now I don't have to. Whenever he does it now I whip out Urine Gone!

"I bought this for my Sun Conure not realizing just how big it is. He already has a similar toy shaped more like a football in pale orange that is more his size. This is meant more for a large parrot not a conure. I use it to put small wood chew toys in it since it is way too big to hold any food he could eat, but probably great for whole nuts. The rubber is very think and appears to be very strong; a conure could never damage it. The bell has the best sound I have ever heard in a bird toy. I just love the sound of it. The ball is sold without the bells inside as a large dog toy so you know it is strong.",birds,0
"I ended up adopting a stray cat that was hanging around my house. She's a very sweet, well-tempered cat, but she's got claws like Wolverine in the X-Men movies/comics and has been shredding my sofa and curtains. I've read disturbing things about declawing cats, and besides, many vets won't declaw a cat older than six months. I'd tried about five different scratching pads & posts, and she showed no interest in any of them. And, while your experience may vary, some websurfing revealed that:1) Cats like sisal fabric, not sisal rope, which is what most scratching posts use. this post uses sisal fabric.2) Cats like to stretch when they scratch. I measured the hole she made in my curtains; it was thirty inches up, and all the scratching posts I tried weren't that tall. This one's 32 inches tall.3) Most of the others I've tried were tippy. This one's got a weighted base.4) It's expensive, but not nearly as expensive as curtains and sofas.I used a laser pointer, got her chasing it, and then ran it up this scratching post. She reached up the post to &#34;get&#34; the little red dot, and then started scratching. Very cool.",cats,2

There was absolutely nothing quiet about it... There is no way I could listen to the pump all day long at the noise level it produced... Not sure if I would recommend as I never got a chance to use it, nor did I want to at that sound level...

"When this arrived, there was shampoo spilled all over the box it came in, but thankfully only about an eighth of the product was lost. I think they shoudl re-design the cap because it seemed like they tried their darndest to wrap the top of the bottle to prevent this from happening... makes me think it is a frequent occurence. However, the shampoo itself works fine and the dogs smelled wonderfully afterward! Were they shinier or fluffier than usual? No. Do I think this is an exceptional shampoo worth the extra money for its performance? Probably not. Do I like the company's stance on providing natural pet products and, more importantly, giving back 10% of proceeds to charities that help animals, the environment, and disadvantaged people? YES, and that's why I would still buy it again, even though I think it's a pretty standard shampoo (though admittedly, my dogs are not sensitive and would be fine with any product - so perhaps it would make a world of difference to a pup with sensitive skin)",cats,2
"Cars, pedestrians, the UPS truck, stray dogs, cats...my otherwise wonderful dog would bark at the slightest provocation and charge madly at his target. I tried the scent-spray collar and it didn't have any impact so this was my last resort. I set the collar on the lowest correction (the deluxe model has three settings), and put his collar on. His next ""bark-a-thon"" lasted about 20 seconds (while he was at the same time charging the front fence at a passing car) - he STOPPED charging toward the fence and STOPPED barking. Four hours later, when he caught wind of a cat in the back yard, he charged out as usual and the barking ended in about 10 seconds. THE END - no kidding! That was five days ago, and he hasn't barked since that first day. Not only am I (and, no doubt, my neighbors) delighted that he's stopped the bark-a-thons, he's much calmer about the normal goings-on around here. He still runs out to check out any strange noises, but there's no charging and spinning out at the fence and he's not chasing the poor cats. I will say that he looked very startled the first time he received a correction - but as soon as I reassured him, all was well again. This works much faster and it's much more effective than months of ""quiet"" commands that were, for the most part, completely ignored. A great product!",dogs,3
"My parents have a cat that goes through terrible allergic episodes where he throws up uncontrollably, breaks out on his skin, his fur falls out, and when he uses the litterbox, it stinks horribly. Thing is, they started to notice that this only happens after feeding him the good old grocery store brand, what I affectionately call ""tails n' scales"", catfood. When he eats the cheapo brands, it usually doesn't take long for him to start throwing up, breaking out, and losing fur, and sending everyone in the house on a mission to find deodorizing spray. However, when fed the Science Diet, he never throws up, and, he never gets hairballs, and thankfully, his use of the litterbox isn't smelly. Science Diet catfood is the one and only food that does not make him spin out of control with an allergic reaction. I recommend it to anyone. I firmly believe that most pet food manufacturers could care less what goes into their food. Not true with Science Diet, it is the one and only food that my parents will buy now. I highly recommend it to anyone.",cats,2

"When this collar works, it works as advertised. However, after three days use, the collar and the remote stopped communicating. Bought a new battery ($8.00!!) for the remote and still nothing. Recharged the collar over and over again -- nothing. Bought a 2nd collar. Same thing happened again -- worked for three recharge cycles then it was dead. By this time the new battery in the remote was dying (it flashes ""L"" for ""low"") and off to the store for another weird-sized $8 battery. Then the first collar came back to life for one recharge cycle, then dead again.There's something in the collar electronics that is simply unreliable. Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with the rechargeable battery. I think it's the electronic circuitry that's faulty. Either a poor design or poor quality control or simply a lack of robustness in the components. But the concept for this collar is great! Fits my dog perfectly, comfortable, intuitive GUI on the remote. Really just a great overall design. Too bad the manufacturing quality just isn't there.BTW, most of the 5-star reviews for this product are by 1st-time buyers of an electronic training collar who rave about how well electronic training collars work.

"I got this when I got my new kitten about 6 months or so ago. The first week I was worried about how he'd adapt so I left the regular cat box next to it. Turns out he was using both... but the dog was eating the poop out of the regular open one, so someone I had coming by when I was out of town kept thinking the cat was only pooping in the clevercat and peeing in the regular box... but it turns out that the dog was just slipping some midnight snacks! gross! Anyway, I got back and quickly took away the regular box once I caught onto the dog's dirty secret, and the kitten has not had any problems whatsoever. In fact, he has a somewhat annoying habit of going to use it right as I'm cleaning it out every day or so... I clean, he pees. Looking up at me while he is peeing being all ""hehe, silly human!"". Repeat daily.Anyway, it's working awesome. No unintended doggie treats. Cat has no problems. I'm overall a very happy cat and dog owner. Also, I find it very easy to find the matching liner bags in a local all-natural store for like 7 dollars... cheaper than on amazon... so I just get those. If the cat scratches through or something and something leaks, I just use a little bleach when replacing the liner and the box is actually very, very clean.",cats,2

"I cannot understand why this product is so difficult to find in local big-box pet supply stores, except that it keeps you from returning to purchase replacement filters on a monthly basis, which incidentally can become quite expensive over time. A great money saving filter that works better than more expensive ""power-filter"" units you can buy off the shelf.If you do a little online research you may find that the combination of this type of filter with a ""power head"" aerator will not only keep your aquarium cleaner and help your fish stay healthier, but it will also save you time and money as a result of its simple design. By merely rinsing the filter periodically, you will keep your aquarium cleaner without all the hassles of draining your aquarium regularly or buying replacement charcoal filter bags as is the case with popular ""power filters"" found in most big-box stores.I have a small 10 gallon tank that I retrofitted with some 1 1/4"" hose to make the Hydro II sponge filter (20 gal) fit properly. I should have bought the 10 gallon version that is not quite as tall. Now my tank stays cleaner, longer, and I am pleased not to have to drain my aquarium every ten days because of ""power-filter"" clogs or failure.",fish aquatic pets,4

It has never irritated his skin or eyes, and he doesn't seem to be bothered with the smell (cats can get to hate some products that smell good for us, but they just stink to them).Also, I have found this shampoo to be a little too concentrate, so I usually dilute a little of it on a cup of warm water - it still makes up for a lot of foam, great cleaning and smell, and lasts for quite a good time!I don't really have a single complain here, this is an excellent product.

"The vinyl outside covers a pad of orthopedic foam, which is where the ""soft"" comes from (at least compared to their hard plastic pads). It's shipped vacuum packed, folded up with all the air sucked out to save space, and for use you just open the valve to let the air back in so the foam expands back to normal thickness. It shouldn't have any excess air to make it act like an air mattress; the instructions even tell you to press some air back out before closing the valve again to prevent any balloon effect. So, claw punctures aren't really an issue (though the vinyl's pretty tough anyway).Don't skimp on the size, the medium is big enough for my fairly small cat to be able to comfortably sprawl out on her side the way she likes (I think she soaks up more heat that way), but the small wouldn't be. It's thick enough to be soft and comfy for my cat, especially with the fleece cover, but could be kind of thin for a heavier dog. The fleece cover also stays on very well for my cat, but I can see how a dog rolling around on it could pull it loose (though some elastic and safety pins might fix that).",dogs,3

I was surprised because I didn't know much about this brand but when I read the other reviewers comments about how little you use of this compared to the others, I was sold.

"I like this product since it is easy to use and set up and seems to have good results. I loved the sound of my cat scrambling to the floor the first time she jumped up on the counter in front of this device! BUT, there is one design flaw in my opinion that can easily be solved:The only on/off is a switch on the back, so it is natural for humans (!) to forget if it is armed or not. A small LED popping out of the top and pulsing on for 100msec every 3-4 sec or so would be great so that you could visually tell if it is armed (on). This method also would not use much power. Too many false alarms by me reduce its effect;) And the on/off switch could be improved since it is small and a bit stiff, and probably the first thing to wear out. Otherwise I like the idea and implementation!",cats,2

"This is a great product that actually works to keep ants out of pet food. The concept is simple -- fill the bottom part of the tray with water and a squirt of dish soap, place the top part on, then put the pet food dishes on top of that. Ants crawl onto the bottom tray, up the wall and into a soapy death.The only ""gotcha"" is to make sure that nothing can form a ""bridge"" between the floor (or other adjacent objects) and the top of the tray -- if your pet is a slob like mine, and drags its food dish halfway off onto the floor, the ants will gain easy access. In this case, avoid placing anything that can be dislodged, or anchor the dish with Velcro(tm).Check the water level regularly and top up as needed.

"My dog loves these types of toys. He's about 40lbs and will chew the heck out of them in about a month or so. It doesn't matter. The toys are about $10 and well worth the hours of enjoyment. Even after he tears the little squirrels (bees, eggs, whatever) to pieces and eats out the inside of the nest he will still bring me the pieces to stuff back inside and throw so he can tear it apart some more. We buy him another when there is nothing left to throw (about every 2-3 months). By that time, the squeaks are all gone, the nest is in pieces and we lost the heads off of all the animals. There is no more stuffing in anything. It's OK because it's a dog toy not a decorative item. The dog doesn't care if it looks like it's been in the blender. He still loves to play with it. The platypus seems to be the one that holds up the best but that one is a little disturbing. The game is that the dog eviscerates the animal to pull out the eggs and chew them. Our dog doesn't seem to mind ripping out the insides of a stuffed animal and eating the eggs. We still have the platypus after about 5 years but the eggs are long gone. The platypus isn't looking too good either. We fill it with ugly dolls or whatever is laying around the house and let him have it. It looks like the movie Alien when he pulls an ugly doll out of a platypus. These toys are lots of fun even if they don't last forever.",dogs,3

"Last year after my then 2-year-old pug had several successive skin rashes, my vet suggested that we put him on a limited ingredient diet that cut out corn and other grains and instead used potatoes as the carbohydrate source. After trying a couple different brands and formulations, I finally found the one that worked best for our pug was Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula.The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. I read that they also have it available in a smaller size for small breed dogs. But my pug, which has a fairly small mouth, seems to have no problem eating this kibble.We once tried another brand of limited ingredient dog food from Royal Canin that contained rabbit and potato. I didn't like that one because the kibble had a strong smell. This one from Natural Balance does not.I was very pleased to see within one month that our pug's skin was free of redness and irritation. When we were gone on vacation for over a week Spanky got nothing else other than this food (no treats!) and his skin showed rapid and remarkable improvement. It seemed fairly obvious that we had finally found a suitable food for him. He hasn't had any gassiness and his stool is not loose or showing any sign of intestinal distress. Spanky will eat pretty much anything, so it's hard to say if he enjoys this food any more than another brand as he basically inhales his food. However, it does seem to keep him full and from begging for so many treats. To me this is usually a good indicator of a quality food, as it doesn't just go right through him like corn-based foods do.Definitely a 5-star food.",dogs,3
I had good luck with this product for my 3 short hair cats but for my long hair it didn't seem to work until the second dose.

I had so much trouble finding something that would actually work because fleas this year have been worse than they ever have been.,cats,2

I made a mistake when I ordered these. I will not buy them again since it is a product of China. My dog got sick on similar strips made in China two years ago. The product explanation for these strips did not state that these are made in China. It should be part of the description since there have been recalls on chicken and duck strips made in China by at least Pet Smart recently.,dogs,3
"This product stinks chemicals so strong - when I just opened the package, my poor dog rushed to the other room and barked!

Biological weapon of mass distruction!",dogs,3

"After Izzy shredded her last bed I wanted to find a bed that was less fuzzy. I liked the high sides, Izzy likes to hang her head up and over the sides of things, and the oval shape. The color is very nice and the bed large. Even though Izzy is only a 14 lb mini schnauzer she likes to lay stretched out.When we first unpacked the bed the bottom was curved and the bed rocked like the foot of a rocking chair. I was concerned it would bother Izzy, but she jumped right in and made herself at home. She likes tucking herself in the crevices between the sides and bottom. The stuffing is very nice, very fluffy and the construction seems soft but durable.*edited 10/23/12Update- despite daily wiggling, happy dancing on her back, digging in her bed, this bed continues to be great. I have tossed it in the washer and dryer and it's really holding up. The bottom continues to be fluffy, the sides are still firm and the sherpa covering still looks very good.",dogs,3
"As one of my cats tends to be troublesome and doesn't always seem to find the litter box when she needs it... I spent a TON of time hunting for the best cleaner for cat urine stains.

"It's a very good product, specially for the price. It seems comfortable and safe for my chihuahua, the only thing that is not so great for me, is that to open it you have to unzip from the bottom and your pet can get out. Other than that, it's a very good product for such a low price.",dogs,3
"We bought the Drinkwell Pet Fountain because my cat loves to drink out of the bathroom faucet. We have had many issues with it being dirty. We have to completely empty, dismantle and disinfect it every two to three days, or it gets pink slime in it. I imagine that this is very unhealthy for your pet! Once it gets slime in it, it takes FOREVER to clean it with little brushes and put it back together, refill it and plug it back in. It is much easier to give our cat a fresh dish of water once a day and put the regular-sized bowl in the dishwasher.",cats,2

I have been using this type of crate for over 10 years in training dogs. They work great! This particular crate is better in that it has a divider piece to use as the puppy grows. Great merchandise and excellent customer service.,dogs,3
Ok I have 1 cat - I bought this because I was living at my parent's house and times when I was out of town they refused to scoop poop so I bought this thing. It's been working since - so the longevity of the product is great. The little trays the poop goes in makes emptying the litter box easy. You do not need to scoop. Remember to put very little amount of litter otherwise it will get clogged and just go back and forth until you stop it. My cat was never afraid of it either.I also purchased the cover for it - while this is good if your cat is shy or if the litter box is kinda out in the open - other than that it's not necessary and it's huge! Adds 2 feet of height to the litter box.,cats,2

"I have a 40lb Australian Cattle Dog and he LOVES to herd this thing around the yard. The only bad part about this is he doesn't understand how to bring it back and he just takes off with it, leaving me to chase him and bring the ball back.

It is so much fun to watch him run around with this thing, barking and wagging his tail and generally having a great time.",dogs,3

I have a 9lb yorkie who the gate works perfect for... and a friend has a 4lb yorkie who can fit through the gate rungs with ease. I didn't screw it into the wall I just put it between the fridge and the wall and put a pillow up against the other end to keep it up. Cheap and it practically comes put together. The wood was cracked at one part where the metal clasps hold the other piece of wood next to it but my boyfriend put some woodworkers glue and masking tape around it for about 48hrs and it holds beautifully now. If you're looking for a cheap gate for a large opening this is perfect for you!,dogs,3

"I have friends who swear by the Gentle Leader as the best dog item they have ever purchased. For us, however, this collar was an incredibly frustrating experience.First of all, our Labradoodle flat-out despised this thing. It was a 15-minute process to put on with him hanging his mouth open and wrestling his head around to avoid it. With a lot of patience I learned to overcome that issue. Because he hated it so much, we left it on him for extended periods to try to get him used to it--but he never gave up trying to tear it off his face. While walking--I could see that if he would calm down and stop trying to wrestle his head back and forth it would really help our walks out as he pulls like crazy.Unfortunately, he never gave up trying to get this thing off. Eventually he figured out how to use his tiny thumb claw to rip the top part off his face (and I had it very snug) and in seconds after his success (before I could do anything about it) he had chewed apart the cheap plastic adjuster--finishing the collar off. Dog One--Me Zero.If you have a laid-back docile dog this might work great--but if you have a laid back docile dog he may not be a puller on walks in the first place. If they had made that clip out of metal rather than plastic I still would have given the item 4 stars just because it obviously works for some people. But to use plastic for that piece is just cheap.",dogs,3
"I tried it on my 6 month old Golden; it removed a lot of hair.

"We've bought 3 of these so far. Our cattle dog loves to play with this toy. The only problem is that he is a serious chewer and this toy just doesn't survive for as long as our other purchases (just for reference, our ACD weighs 44 lbs. and is 1.5 years old). Even though we have to keep his play with this toy to short intervals, and even though it doesn't hold up to his focused chewing, we still think it's a great product. It's softer than some of the more durable toys we have in the house, so it doesn't scuff the floor or floorboards as much. If you have a less aggressive chewer this is probably a solid 4-5 star product. It can be cleaned after outside play and the company has a good track record (as far as we are able to find out in our brief research).Pros",dogs,3
This does not adequately work on scoopable litter and I find calling it large is a misnomer. TOO SMALL,cats,2
"Nobody enjoys the revolting task of scooping the litter box. The promise of a product that will free us from this disgusting chore is very, very tempting. But the LitterMaid is not the solution.I've owned two. They clog. The rake gets stuck. The cord gets covered in waste. They're hard to clean. They dump dirty litter on your floor. The waste receptacles are proprietary and (relatively) expensive.Spend the extra money and buy a Litter Robot. Google it if you need to know where. It's three times the price, but it's worth every penny to get an automatic litterbox that actually works.",cats,2
"Wow, what a great crate! I bought this crate for my Vizsla puppy who will grow up to 60+ pounds. Now he's 16 pounds and the divider is fantastic to adjust the crate as my puppy grows.

"Great car seat for our chihuahua. This safe booster seat means that our dog is secure if we stop suddenly or go around a sharp corner, he will not fly into the dashboard or off the seat. The good height of the seat means that pup can have his back window down and get some fast air in his face!I nearly gave this product five stars except for two design aspects. Firstly, the back seat must have a proper headrest, not a moulded one on the seat. So this booster seat works in my husbands car but not mine. Secondly, the clasp for the collar is a plastic clip. I think a carabiner clip would be pretty brilliant, but I can easily pop one on mine for ease of clipping in.Dog is happy in seat and has only tried to get out once. This rendered him sitting comfortably next to the booster on the back seat, no strangulation or discomfort and still secure.",dogs,3
Excellent product. My dog has loved this toothpaste from the 1st time getting her teeth brushed at 3 months old. She is now 3 1/2 yrs old and doesn't like any other toothpaste except C.E.T. vanilla mint flavored. The seller was excellent and shipped quickly. Thank you for the great service!,cats,2

"We have three cats, but one who is 16 and for some odd reason, just stopped going to the box. It has been a TRIAL. I've had to throw out floor rugs that were 'impacted', with both #1 & #2. We took her to the vet, who said she had gotten a bacterial infection and meds helped solidify things, but she still refused to use the box. Seriously, I was considering it time to send her off to kitty heaven. I read an article about the low front Lucky Champ box and ordered it to see if it was just her having trouble getting into the box. We named it the Titanic when it arrived, it is so large, and we were sure that our 11 lb cat would at least have a shot at getting in to give it a go. No go. I decided to try this litter which says on the label Guaranteed. I took the box out, washed it and removed the old litter and added the Precious Cat litter. She went into the box the same day. Since we have three litter boxes, and the other two cats were of course, attracted to the same 'new' litter, I tossed the old boxes and bought two new boxes at the local dollar store, while I waited for two larger boxes on backorder to arrive. Add the same Precious Cat litter. Bam! The problem cat will go into ANY of the 3 boxes to go; she didn't need a fancy box, just a litter that she likes! To me, worth every dime. Wish I had known about it earlier as I lost about $800 in rugs. I also found that I can buy it from Wag.com direct; $49.00 and the shipping goes Free, which if you buy it here, it still comes from them, but there is the shipping charge. Highly recommend, even in the most desperate of situations. Added Bonus",cats,2

However, I consider this my fault since I ordered the white one. I plan on purchasing another and will buy it in a different color next time.",dogs,3
"I received the Petsafe bark collar a couple days ago and my home has finally returned to PEACE! My dog was born to bark! She's a 5 month old Golden Retriever that has been a huge barker since she was brought home at 6 weeks old. We couldn't even go to the bathroom, take a shower, sit at the table or lounge on the couch without a wild barking fit that could only be stopped by giving her more attention. We tried everything from firm commanding, timeouts, ignoring, spray bottles, etc. Everything just excited her more and caused even more loud barking! I had always thought that bark collars were inhumane and cruel but after 3 months of constant frustration and anger I had to break down and give it a try. I tested the collar first on myself and was surprised how light the first few shocks were. After putting it on her it only took a couple seconds for the first bark to arrive. She was surprised, not hurt. She began to look around for what could have caused the shock. A few seconds later the next bark came out and she immediately realized that she could no longer pointlessly bark without some sort of consequence. Of course, we always take it off when playing, going to the park, going on walks, sleeping, eating, etc.I will say that if I could give this product 4.5 stars I would. It doesn't always catch every bark and she finds it pretty easy to scratch it over to the side. I believe a few design modifications could fix this problem though. But, more often than not the collar catches the bark and sends her the adequate shock to disrupt her behavior. I am happy to say that she has only barked a total of ten times within the past few days (used to bark more than 200 times daily)! Also, because she usually barked while doing other unwanted behavior (jumping on the couch, begging, nipping at heels while we walk around the house) the collar deters her from this too and she has begun to realize that she can no longer do these things either. It's been great! Everyone's been happier, she's a joy to be around more than ever, and she's responding to all sorts of training even faster.I definitely recommend this product to anyone else with a bark-crazy dog that has been unresponsive to alternative training!",dogs,3

I have been giving this this product to our dogs for years. I have 3 labs and 1 golden retriever. The golden retriever is almost 12 years old and has absolutely no joint problems (ever). The Golden has been taking joint max for 7 years now. A 4 year old chocolate lab has had elbow surgery in each elbow and ACL surgery in one back leg and has been on the joint max for 3+ years and is doing fantastic. The almost 2 year old black lab has had elbow surgery and has been taking joint max for 1 year (since we adopted him) and is now doing great. The 4 year old yellow lab has never had any issues and is just starting on it as a precaution. I highly recommend joint max. This seller has had the best price I have seen on this product so far and has very fast service. I recommend them also.,dogs,3

"I have 2 adult cats that needed to increase their water consumption, and any vet will tell you a good fountain is the best solution. My cats are VERY drawn to the running water and the clear reservoir on the back lets me see how much they are drinking. This fountain is well designed, easy to fill, has great capacity, and is nicely quiet. Its a little difficult to clean without the Drinkwell cleaning kit, so you will want that immediately. I also like the 2-stage filters you can use with it to ensure your pets get uncontaminated water.I needed a way to ensure my cats got lots of water, and this fountain did the trick and then some! Easy to use and maintain and highly recommended!",cats,2
"I bought this litterbox for $150 at the beginning of the year. Despite using premium cat litter AND FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS, THANK YOU, the rake would constantly get stuck. Also, my cats would sometimes pee on the cover where it would flow on to the floor. And, those disposable litter containers cost about a buck each. Today, the machine broke, and I am not going to bother calling the manufacturer because I don't want the darned thing repaired; it's going to the landfill.Two different friends of mine have a LitterMaid, and are quite pleased with the product -- I bought this one because of that. The difference is that I bought the ""Elite Mega,"" while they have earlier versions. The rake on the Elite Mega is exposed all the time, where theirs goes into a slot, and I think that the older ones are just better engineered and less cheaply made. So, if you want an automated litterbox, avoid this particular model. The others might be okay, and I just may try one of them (besides, I've got about $50 worth of disposable litter containers).I did call customer service once, and the woman on the other end was rude and useless, so no points there, either.Good Luck!Dorene",cats,2
"My cat loves to play with this toy, both with and without me. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that he can only play with it for a certain amount of time before it starts to irritate his lips and gums. I don't know if that's a purely mechanical thing, or if there's something in the fabric he's sensitive to. He's also managed to chew off a piece of fabric at the end. So it's a nice toy, but not indestructible.",cats,2

I was happy I guessed right on the size as fitting is crucial. The DVD was very helpful in fitting and handling the dog with this new collar and technique. My dog is a Doberman puppy- but a huge puppy and she pulls during our entire walk. The collar has definitely helped and I am enjoying our walks far more. I have her staying by my side most of the time and she only trips me a few times per walk- so this is definitely progress. Thank-you Gentle Leader.,dogs,3
"I bought two of these- one for my in-laws and one for our chocolate lab. Maggie, my in-law's dog, took to it right away. She is using it, no issues. It has even gotten cold enough that the water would have frozen and there were no issues. My lab on the other hand, has a habit of dipping her paws in the water first to check it and is constantly spilling the water everywhere. That is probably my fault. We had to switch her back to a larger bucket outside, I guess I will just be in charge of checking on ice every day!My only complaint about the bowl was the plastic is quite thin and the plug is almost too heavy for the outlet. The cord sags in our outlets which could be due to the weight of the cord. Our lab is a chewer, so a protected cord was a must.",dogs,3

I have a beagle and I would highly recommend a spray collar over a shock collar for a self disciplining tool. I have tried 2 different models and this is the better one since it relys upon the sound vibrations against the neck and isn't a barb that pokes into the neck.

I mean the part is what it is, it holds the tube in the tank nothing fancy no ponies will shoot out, your fish Won't dance because of it, However i don't want to kill my husband when i get up in the morning to find the living room flooded So i suppose it does prevent divorce and homicide.",fish aquatic pets,4

"My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools. Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy. After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend. It has been for me. Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff.",cats,2

I think I've had 4 or 5 of them in the last 5 years.2. It seems to be overpriced for what it is. It is a piece of plastic with a couple of metal posts, a small circuit board I'm sure, a battery and the actual collar that goes around the dog's neck... I really don't think it would cost the company more than $15 when you think about other electronics and products out there. I would be more than willing to pay the $55 for the collar if it lasted longer... it just puts a sour taste in my mouth when it seems to break so often.Bottom line.... It works.",dogs,3

"I decided to wait until after 6 months use before leaving my review for this product, after all, what we really need to know is how it works in the LONG RUN. The 3 stars is because the price of the cartridges have gone up so much, were it not for that I would have given it 5 stars.First off, the crystals track some, not gonna lie about that. However, I have two cats in a studio apartment and I don't touch this thing UNTIL it starts to smell, which (I must be lucky), has averaged to be at around 3 weeks use.The thing looks cheap as hell. I wish they would make a new model that had an actual bottom as opposed to the replaceable cardboard making up the bottom. My other problem is that because my apartment is so small, it is smushed between bookcases and it is extremely unwieldy to change the litter cartridges. If I had this in a basement say, with room to spread out, I think it would be very easy to change. This is why if they made a real whole system, I would pay a lot more for it. Something like littermaid where you just lifted the poop out.But see the cartridges have gone up tremendously since I bought the product and if they built an easy to use system with no cartridges they would loose revenue so I have little hope on that front.I have been reusing the cartridges though. I just dump the poop and old litter out when it starts to smell and put new litter in. My cartridges do not leak at all. Also, on EBAy you can buy plastic cartridges which can be used over and over, which I will do soon. I'm trying to rig a system to make it easy to just lift the poop without picking up the frame. If I could do that, the system would be perfect!I wish these companies would be more interested in creating excellence than in creating an expensive system that keeps us tied them forever.I like it better than Littermaid though because during the summer, my littermaid would smell horrible, the poop would ""melt"" and stick to the prongs, total mess. This really doesn't stick unless I let it sit forever and it starts to fill up. I can't believe I can't smell it. I keep wondering what would happen if I bought another littermaid and put crystals in it instead of litter. Would that make the perfect system? Or would the crystals somehow mess up the litterbox? Hard to say, too expensive to try anyway!In summary - very messy to change unless you have room to spread out (but still way worth it for the convenience of no touch/no smell for weeks). Cartridges too expensive, I refuse to pay those prices no matter what I have to do to find workarounds! Highly recommended on the whole.",cats,2
"Caring for fish in a very small bowl like this one is stressful both for the fish and the fishkeeper.In a small bowl like this, the fish's waste will build up rapidly (espcially since there is no filter). This causes suffering (for example, eye and skin irritation), sickness, and even death. You can try to prevent this by changing the water frequently; however, frequent water changes are also stressful for the fish. (Not to mention a pain for the fishkeeper!)In addition, the temperature of such a small volume of water will fluctuate rapidly; another source of stress for the fish. You cannot use a heater in a bowl this small.In particular, this bowl is *not* ideal for goldfish and bettas.Goldfish grow to be up to one foot long. Even when they are smaller, they produce a lot of waste. Goldfish need 10-20 gallons of water *each*, and they are schooling fish so you shouldn't have just one.Bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to 80F; there is no way to safely heat a tank smaller than 5 gallons.If you'd like to care for a fish, please read some of the excellent websites out there and learn all you can. (Ignore manufacturers websites, since of course they will say their products are great, even crummy products like this one.) Get the largest tank you can afford. If you can't afford a large enough tank, please don't get the fish.",fish aquatic pets,4
My pooch loves to lay out in this bed while I am outside as well,cats,2
"I recently bought a dog collar through Amazon that is battery operated and fits around the dogs neck like a normal collar but has citronella that comes with it and you fill the device that hangs around the dogs neck. The vibration from the dogs throat sets off the spray and it sprays a citrus smelling vapor in front of his face and nose. I have a miniature poodle who is 6 years old and for 6 years barks whenever I leave him in the car, whenever anyone comes over, whenever he sees anyone on the street, whenever someone is eating and he wants some. I mean, it was bad...and my fault that I never addressed it sooner. I did not have high hopes for anything working this late in his life after barking for 6 years pretty much uncontrolably. I investigated all of the products I could find online and found this to be the most humane and least harmful to the dog. I can not believe how well this has worked. Kobe, my dog, who barked at everyone who came to the door....and I run a guest house in Provincetown, no longer barks when I leave him in the car at the store, no longer barks when someone comes to the door, no longer barks at anyone on the street. I had him wear it for about 4 or 5 days from when he got up until when he went to bed at night. One day, he was laying on me on the couch and started snoring so loud, it set the spray off and he jumped up and sat on my shoulder and looked around as if to say , ""what the hell just happened?!"". This product is amazing and I don't know that it would work for any dog but I sincerely have to tell you that I had no hope for Kobe! Ask any of my friends!! Simply amazing. I still cannot believe it. It's been probably three weeks now and he still barks on occasion, like when a stranger is at the door but, never barks in the car when I leave, never barks at other people, never barks, never barks, never barks!! I cannot say enough about this product and the price I paid at Amazon was half of what the same product was being sold for in Petco and PetSmart and on Ebay. I honestly thought this would never happen but I have a dog now that doesn't bark and it amazes me!",dogs,3

"My cats enjoyed these on Christmas morning. They were each given one (saving the rest for another time) and they dissappeared immediately. Since then they have resurfaced every other day, and especially at night. They are holding up well, especially with my giant cat attacking them. I have only used 3 so far, so they will last a long while at this rate. Who would have thought a little spring would be more fun than all of their ""complex"" toys with batteries and whatnot.",cats,2

"I have two small dogs who often travel with me in the car and who have a tendency to not sit still during the entire trip. I had previously had a dog car seat that resembled a plastic tub with foam inside and a cover on top of it. It worked for a short period of time, but due to the design of it and my dogs moving around, it always tipped over. I finally talked myself into getting a Buddy Lookout car seat, and I'm so glad I did. Not only is it stable and comfortable for them, but it also allows them to move around without me worrying if it will fall over. The dogs actually enjoy the ride more now because they are so elevated, they are able to see everything outside where as before they had to stand on their hindlegs in order to look out the window. I also feel much better knowing that they are secure in their seat and that if I need to brake suddenly that they are not going to go flying into the backside of my driver seat. It's also much safer for me now because I don't have to worry about the dogs wanting to try to get in my lap while I'm driving - which has almost caused a few mishaps in the past!",dogs,3
"WOW! My cat loves this thing! I wasn't sure since it looks funny... but it sure works!

"My cat absolutely loves his fountain. Honestly, I thought getting a fountain for my pet was a little ridiculous, but I couldn't get him to drink enough water and it was causing health problems. Now he drinks water all the time. The unit is very quiet (just a slight bit of a humming noise) and I only have to refill it a little bit every few days. I passed on the extra capacity fountain and glad I did- I don't think you really need it, especially for a single cat. Good tip with the icecubes! Dropping a few in cools the water, which my cat really likes.",cats,2
"This is nice and thick material, very bright, very waterproof - but sizing according to the chart they provide was a Fail. I measured, came up with Large, which was weird since it's a 26-lb dachshund-mix I bought it for. It turned out to be the right length head-to-tail, but too long for his short legs, so it gets really muddy. The front especially has this wide flare. I sewed it down so my dog doesn't look like a super-here-wanna-be. I would've bought a medium if I had used common sense - my dog's not a teacup size and not as big as my Labrador - so that's why I say",dogs,3
"This is the second one of these I've had now. The first one lasted about 2 years, then for some reason started leaking out of the cap when inverted on a hike. Maybe water froze in it and expanded it over the winter. All in all, however, I liked it enough to order another. My dog has strong opinions about what she'll drink water out of. She does not like the fold-up, packable nylon bowls. She likes this trough a lot. I usually just pour the water into it, rather than using the spray lid. The spray is a nice fine mist if your dog likes being misted. Mine has an opinion about that, too! This is actually a convenient way to carry her water as long as I wear pants with a belt to hang it from. I wish there were an equally brilliant design to take when we go running though. It also works well for us in the car when we run errands.",cats,2

"On October 26th 2012 I ordered the same exact Frontline Plus I order from Amazon every 6 months. I have ordered my Frontline direct from Amazon LLC (never a 3rd party vendor) for over two years and never had a problem, until now.When I initially opened the package I found the blister packs were different then normal, not necessarily a big deal as manufactures regularly change their packaging. However, when I cracked open the vile the smell of the product was noticeably different so I decided to contact Merial directly and see if they had changed their packaging. The Merial rep said they had not and asked me to confirm several other aspects of the packaging. The serial numbers actually matched correctly for the US product however she agreed the blister pack sounded odd so she asked I mail them the remaining viles and box for evaluation; Merial case # 12-117630 for any doubters.On January 10th I was contacted by Merial and they confirmed that the product is counterfeit and a very good one with matching serial numbers! To be fair to Amazon I contacted them today and they have refunded my money however there could be many other customers that have made this purchase and received fake product putting your dog at risk of flea infestation. I put my dogs on Comfortis as a precaution and will continue to do so until I can again find a reasonably priced supply of Frontline Plus that is not counterfeit.It is important to note the Merial rep said they do not have a direct working relationship with Amazon and the supplier is a 3rd party. It seems Amazon needs to step up its quality checks on its 3rd party suppliers!I have said my piece, caveat emptor.",dogs,3
"I have been buying this at the vets for $28.50 for 30 grams. I find it on here $33 and change for 120 grams. What a deal and did my jaw drop. I notice such a diffrence in my dogs eyes. Dont have that messy goppy eyes. When I ran out and was not able to use it for a few days, I did notice a huge diffrence. This stuff is so worth it. You will love it love it love it. No more stains and helps a bunch with the drainge in the eyes. I just put it in some wet food and that is all and 120 grams should last me 2 months. Try it you will not be disapointed at all. But remember to give it like 2 weeks to see a diffrence and a full month for a complete diffrence.",dogs,3

"Ok. No one likes this particular form of backyard clean-up. At least now you can buy a tool that makes the job quick and not so dirty. Why didn't I buy this thing sooner? It keeps you a couple feet away from the business end, scoops right through grass to only pick-up what you're after and feels like it will last a long time (sturdy construction). The last scooper I had was this hand-held scissor-like thing that required you to get your hand down to the ground and it grabbed the grass as you lifted up. (I had to be careful not to close the scooper too tightly as I lifted up - I didn't want the grass to break off and get a scoopful of poo in my face!) This design just works. If this company made a version with the tines of the rake a little closer together, I would buy it (I have a 26 lb. dog). However, that's just a small suggestion. I'm really happy with this product.",dogs,3

"This is a perfect solution for a small 25lb dog. She rides safe and in comfort. She can safely lay down and still see all the activity outside. No more wandering from side to side trying to see out. The product also comes with a small restraint to keep her in the car seat, although she still hasn't figured out how to avoid getting wrapped up in it yet. I would highly recommend this product to keep canine ""babies"" safe in a vehicle.",dogs,3
I like these collars a lot. The one that I bought was black so I can't speak to the red vs pink controversy but I couldn't be happier. These slip on and it takes a little trial and error adjustment to get it just the right size but once on it stays. The harder the dog pulls the tighter it becomes - but it's has a limit on how tight making it safer than a conventional choke collar.,dogs,3

"So this toy is supposedly the ""toughest soft toy on the market"" well, it very well may be, but it didn't last 15 minutes in the mouth of my 1 and a half year old Brittany Spaniel, Darwin, Darwin made quick and easy work of this toy by chewing through the black outer border of the ring this enabled him to quickly disembowel the toy by removing all of the stuff and squeekers out of the toy. Now, he has yet to be able (today is the second day) tear the toy into tiny pieces which eventually end up being covered in slobber and dropped in my lap, so that does say something. However, I have a heavy chewer, he loves to destroy toys, it may work very well for less-active chewers, that said I am still looking for a toy that can stand up to my Darwin.

The rod is made with fiberglass and Boris chewed on the end of the rod. When I picked it up my hand received lots of tiny fiberglass splinters which are very painful and impossible to see to get out. Once the pole was wrapped in duct tape it worked great. So a good product, but keep the pole part away from your cat, and your hand.",cats,2
I used to feed my cockatiels colored pellets but changed to these at the recommendation of my avian vet because of the dyes. I've been feeding this to my cockatiels for over 7 years along with occasional fresh foods and seeds. Getting them to eat the healthy fresh foods can be difficult so I feel better that pellets are supplementing some of the nutrition they need. I never could get my oldest cockatiel (29yr) to take to any pellets as he had eaten an all seed diet his whole life.,birds,0

"I wanted a brush for my large dog's teeth. I love the small-dog CET brush, but couldn't find a large-dog brush anywhere except for these dual-head brushes. What a stupid design! You can't lay it down in a drawer without squashing the bristles on one side or the other. I put my brushes in the dishwasher and then the bottom brush gets squashed in the silverware rack. To solve the problem, I cut off the small-dog end of it with a wire cutter. Now I have a decent large-dog brush. The angle is good for a human hand to reach the curves of a dog's mouth. Everything else about the brush is great except for the dual-head business.If anyone from CET reads this, I sure wish you'd wise up and make a single-head large-dog brush just like you do for the small dogs. You're dual-end brush is probably getting your marketing dept excited, but in the real world, it's a joke. I can't understand why you make it easy for small dog owners to get a nice single-head brush, but you penalize large-dog owners.I actually have BOTH large and small dogs. I buy the small-dog single brush for the small guys. I definitely do NOT want the hassle of using and cleaning the dual-head brush.",dogs,3

"Let me first saying about how I came to find this product. I have a myspace account with about 5,000 friends and I posted a bulletin on there about how I desperately needed to clean up after a male cat who sprayed and peed everywhere in my home. I received probably thirty or more emails and two of them were recommending me to try this product. I looked online and no one had this product but Amazon and then the website also said that Target carried it also.I read the reviews on Amazon and decided that I really needed this based on the positive reviews. I went to Target today which is the only place that I have been able to find it and there was only 3 left and I picked up two of them and came home and did my bedroom. It only costs $4 and some change per bottle Now I know that I should have got all 3 because I used 1 FULL bottle on my mattress alone! I am almost out of it since I have done my bedroom but I need about 10 more bottles to do my whole home. Cat urine is a very strong odor and I have had this odor in my home for several months even though I no longer have cats and I have used everything that you can possibly think of to clean my home. You name it, I have tried it. All kinds of spray Lisol cleaners as well as bleach, pine sol and several Febreeze and Oust, Lysol, Glade and several other cleaners including oda-ban, comet, etc.. Even brands promicing to remove pet odors and stains and none has worked. I have a fortune worth of cleaners under my cabinet right now but I am sure that this has done the trick because for now the smell is completely gone.This product promices not just to cover up the odors but promices to completely eliminate the odors and whatver causes them. It breaks down the chemical in urine and completely eliminates it. My mom wanted to know why it did not come in a spray bottle and from reading on the website is because to get deep down in surfaces of carpets and mattresses, etc it has to go deep and a spray bottle only reaches the surface. I did pour less then a 1/2 a botle into a empty spray bottle so that I could clean the dresser and side of the mattress easier but actually it works better if it can reach deep down into surfaces so that is why it does not come into a spray bottle. Wow this product is amazing! I sprayed it on my mattress and you could actually hear it making a light siziling noise and I stuck my nose to it and I could not smell any more urine. I cannot sleep on my mattress tonight because I soaked it in this stuff but I really think that it did the trick!! I am going to mop my tiles with it tomorrow. You can also use this on your sofa and bedding, laundry as well as almost any household surface. I also used it to clean the dressers in my room! The only place that I probably will not be able to get into is deep into my vents and cats can pee in floor vents so I am trying to do what I can to clean it out. I hope that all of this information helps!The smell of Kids N Pets is actually not strong at all, I cannot describe it but it has a light pleasant scent. It has been a few hours since cleaning and I am still able to smell it when I walk into my bedroom. The odor is not strong at all, not near as strong as other chemicals such as bleach, etc.. This is a marvelous product and I can highly recommend it to everyone. [...].. I will be back to load up tomorrow and I hope that they stock up! I plan on doing my entire home and also saving some even after the urine smell is gone because it does clean so well! This product also promices to eliminate other smells and stains such as skunk, blood, and sooooo much more.. Works great on Stains also... Give this product a try!",cats,2

One dog took to the feeders right away - our dominant older dog. The other learned to eat - but was not comfortable - running when the door snapped down. We helped her initially and she gradually got better at it. Finally there was one more fight- as the dominant dog had still been harassing the younger one - and she'd had enough. The younger ""won"" (no blood shed) and now proudly zips from feeder to feeder to show us how she can eat any time she wants to. They have also paid for themselves already in the reduction of food eaten by the birds. Our problems solved!We are very happy we found them.",cats,2

It was ugly, and mostly unnecessary after he grew out of his chewing phase. I only need a crate for him when he's sick or when I'm traveling with him, which I do often.When I set it up, he ran right into it and laid down which is a good sign from my cautious pup.I love that the doorway can be rolled up instead of just swung open, and also that the top can open.I originally purchased the 24"" crate rated for dogs up to 25 lbs, but decided it was too small. My 14"" tall boy couldn't really sit up straight.

For some strange reason, neither of my kittens would play with the toy that has cloth fringe on 3 sides. But when I snipped the fringe off two sides, my kittens immediately began playing with both toys equally. Go figure...",dogs,3
I thought this treat was a toy and so I gave one to one of my dogs and I went out for about 15 minutes and I came back in to one prong left total!! I was freatking out! She did vomit later but it wasn't to bad. I would have LOVED this to be a toy!! LOVE the shape but it's WAY to big for an edible! This was bought for Springers. I suggest to people out there that want to buy this to break off each prong and give one prong to your dog. If you can't make a toy then how about a smaller version treat?,dogs,3

"We got the large round metal tags for our two dogs. The engraving is very easy to read and deeply embedded in the metal. The last time we got tags, (another brand) the engraving wasn't very deep; and wore off quickly. This will not be a problem with these!Our major concern was having enough information on the tags to help someone find us if the dogs got lost. I had to call KV Vet Supply to ask this question - there are up to five lines with 20 characters per line - plenty of space for all our information. You are sent a post card which you fill out and send in. The tags are then sent to you; they came promptly.My only knock is the lack of product information listed about the tags (as I searched the net for other tags, this was a chronic problem).",cats,2

"I do not recommend this product, due to its excessive noise-level. Purchased this product (through Amazon) on September 14, 2010...contacted Veterinary Ventures, Inc. at their Reno, NV address, after receiving product; their customer service instructed me to completely clean unit/motor, which I did...reassembled; still noisy, Phoned the company again, and they graciously mailed me a replacement-motor on September 21, 2010, which I installed...no difference...still a rumbling, grinding noise after running for a couple of minutes. Rechecked written instructions; followed recommended cleaning/reassembly instructions; still no change. So I got disgusted, and instead went to PetSmart, where I purchased a Catit Fresh&Clear #50053 Drinking Fountain. What a difference! - - just a whisper of a sound, as it's running, and my cat is not fearful of this item, as he was of the Drinkwell.",cats,2

"I have five cats, all with their own quirks when it comes to water. Cleo, who is very neurotic and is afraid of everything (and I swear, sees dead people!) only drank out of a specific bowl; Melvin is easy, he will drink out of any bowl and has no interest in faucets or toilets; Autumn, (Cute as a)Button and Fizzgig are obsessed with drinking out of any running faucet with Button driving me insane with her ""toilet surfing."" While the solution to the toilet mess was easily solved by closing the lid, the faucet obsession was not...until I got the Drinkwell. ALL of my ""babies"" love it! Even Cleo, that only drank out of a specific bowl, now frequents the Drinkwell.The set-up was very easy (except for keeping a couple very curious cats out of it! LOL) and so far I have not had any problems with it. While the motor is very quiet, the flowing water does make a trickling sound (but I like that).I would NOT recommend this for anyone that does not want to keep up with the frequent water changes and cleaning of it. I use the filtered water from my frig however, I change the water in the fountain twice a week as it develops a bit of foam and a slimy feel to the bowl. I think that may be from having 5 cats using it, so it gets a lot of saliva in it. I actually wash it and rinse the filter every week. Although it says it is dishwasher safe (which was part of the reason I bought it), I still wash it by hand. With the way the sections are designed, I cannot figure out how to position it in the dishwasher so that it gets thoroughly cleaned without water pooling one area or another.For me, this product is a godsend. The cats LOVE it! I can now turn on a faucet without a mini stampede of cats all vying for a drink!! I do think it is a health benefit for the cats as they ALL drink more frequently. Plus, its really fun watching them as they get in all sorts of positions to drink from the fountain. :)",cats,2

"i bought a gentle leader for my 3 month old GREAT DANE puppy. It does give me better control over her versus a regular nylon collar. I do think you can train a dog not to pull and to pay attention to you and follow you with this halter.You just gotta learn how to. But FIRST you have to fit it on right in order for it to work.In the DVD i received with the head halter it said to make the neck strap tight enough so that only ONE finger can fit underneath it. So i put the the halter on tightly behind her ears, and even then i could STILL fit two of my fingers. So i tightened it more, and more..and STILL i could fit 2 fingers but i figured it was tight enough so i stopped tightening it. Then i took my dog out for a walk and a few minutes into it, her breathing started to be affected by the tightness of the halter around her neck. She was WEEZING and unable to take in a full breathe of air so i immediately removed it and her breathing went back to normal. REMEMBER at this point of tightness i could STILL fit TWO fingers underneath the halter and she is not a small dog, she is a great dane!!! FURTHERMORE! the halter moves from the original place i put it on her neck due to the movements during the walk. THAT is something NOT address AT ALL in the instructional dvd. So, i was constantly repositioning the collar! AND REMEMBER, this was at a level of tightness which inhibited my dogs BREATHING!!I will NEVER put the gentle leader on my dog the way the product makers say to.I DO NOT think it needs to be on SO! tightly in order for the dog to be controlled by it. The next day, i put the halter on her, and this time i put it on her to where it was right behind her ears and able to only slide down less than half an inch from where i originally placed it.I was able to fit TWO fingers underneath the halter, even 3! This worked PERFECTLY, and i was still able to control her very well.The product makers instructions are basically telling owners to squeeze their dogs necks to a chocking point!! and THAT IS WRONG AND UNNECCESSARY. To an inexperienced owner like myself, i ended up chocking my dog!! FURTHERMORE!!, the DVD says your dog would let you know if it was uncomfortable. VERY VERY WRONG!! EXTREMELY WRONG!! i was able to walk my dog down half a block without even a single protest from her due to the uncomfortableness of the collar because i am her pack leader and if i say she is to do something she will do it like i say with true DOG LOYALTY AND TRUST!!With the way I fit it, she was NOT able to take it off, it was SECURE, and the product WORKED just like it was suppose to.Also, just to respond to what a dog trainer on this comments page previous said about being alpha. You admitted when a dog is in an unnatural situation (HUMAN HOMES) dominance behaviors are produced because they are forced to form unnatural packs (with humans and other animals) while living in captivity. So, establishing an alpha position over a dog is very important and undermining that concept to inexperienced dog owners is not right.",dogs,3

"I bought a 5 gallon air pump for more than this, and that air pump failed to pump air through 2 2.5gal tanks. So, I went to the overkill side and purchased this. First, though, I want to address some of the other reviews.NO air pump, I repeat, NO AIR PUMP IS SILENT. If a manufacturer tries to sell you a silent air pump, you need to step back and assess if their project development team has taken remedial physics. Vibrations create sound, which means no silent vibrating air pump diaphragms. According to classical physics, it is physically impossible for that to happen. However, through sound damping and clever material choice, you can make it so that it's close to silent. You'll never actually get there, but you can make it quiet enough to not be heard over the usual white noise of the home.This air pump is the quietest I've ever gotten my hands on. I live in a building with a constant low level of background noise, and I have to concentrate to pick the pump's quiet hum out. It's well constructed, the rubber feet do a lot in the way of damping sound, and if you have it in a bedroom, wrapping it with a towel makes it practically inaudible. Otherwise, it's a very well built and well functioning pump for its price. You will never find anything as good quality as this and for as low a price as this; I can guarantee it from weeks of searching online.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I love this thing! I had no trouble setting it up - the instructions were very easy to follow. My skittish cat got used to it pretty quickly - I followed the recommendations in the instruction book to get him used to the new box and once I removed his old litter box he began using the new one right away. I use World's Best brand biodegradable corn-based litter and biobags cat pan liners (for the bin underneath). I empty the bin once a week and add more litter about 2x a month. I haven't had any odor issues or residue left in the bottom of the pan like I used to get with my old ""manual"" litter box. My cat seems happier now that he always has clean litter - no more manic 10 minute-long covering episodes. The machine is pricey but well worth it for my cleaner smelling room, happier kitty, and the time freed up from litter duties.",cats,2
After reading all the glowing reviews for the Safari De-Matting Comb I decided to try it. Not Impressed. Overall I found it to do what it's supposed to. It works well with a gentle sawing motion and as long as you are patient. It took me 15 minutes to remove one matted clump from my Spaniel's underbelly. Personally I think I can get more done with a metal comb as the teeth are closer together and I don't have to make repeated passes in the same spot to catch the knots. I really can't complain too much being that the price was so great but I found the blades to be impossible to reverse. There really is no way to safely remove the blades without the risk of damaging the blades or my hands!! If anyone has had success in reversing the blades please let me know your technique!,dogs,3
"I got a great deal here at Amazon on my Furminator. Were it not for that, I'd be embarassed about the rip-off after falling for all the hype. I'm sure it's a matter of dog breed, time of year, something, but it's not working like the vids for me and my dog, an Aussie. The fur floating thru our home and landing everywere is only a little better. His coat looks better, but I had expected to get hands full of fur from him and I really have to work at it.

"I received a new ""improved"" kind of bag instead of the ones pictured. Instead of a perforated edge that is straight across, the new design has a curved perforated edge that turns into the handles, there by ""saving"" 10% or 20% of the material. Even in a lit room, following the long curved perforation is difficult and results in torn bags. Can you imagine using these on a dark night? And the reason I bought these is because they are (used to be) bigger than many of the cheap knockoffs. Not anymore.-1 point for tearing-1 point for smaller-1 point for the picture not matching the product-2 points for the text that makes an advantage out of using 20% less material.Sigh.",dogs,3
"WOW - I just received my FURminator (small blue one for a cat) and even after brushing her with a slicker brush this morning I now have a wad of fur 6"" wide and 1"" thick. Granted this is a long haired cat with a thick undercoat but I brush her 5x a week - this is just incredible. As long as I keep brushing with long, light strokes she loves it - even on her neck. Possibly the people who have problems are brushing too hard - I can see how that would irritate the animal's skin as the teeth of the furminator are heavy and sharp - not flexible at all. Definitely 5 stars in my book!",cats,2

"When I first got my rats, I extensively researched products for them. This rat food came up very high on my list. However, it was not locally available. I got a rat block that was sold in my area. Then I couldn't get to the pet store and I had to leave town before I could get there. The only rat food at the grocery store was a loose mix. It turned out my rats didn't like it very well. I had read they would pick and choose, but they just didn't like it at all. I was a little leery of getting this because they talk about transitioning your rat and so many people said their rats didn't like it at first. My rats must be the exception to the rule. They absolutely loved it to the point that they take it like a treat. They like it better than the loose food and better than their usual rat blocks. I intend to continue feeding this to them.

"I was looking for a litter to replace the heavily perfumed clay litters I had been using. My house is not very large and even when the litter box was in the back room I could walk in the front door and smell nothing but perfumed litter. I chose Natures Miracle based on a rating from my local Petco as one of the better litters. Very wrong!!! The smell right out of the bag is just like cypress mulch. That is not a bad smell, but I don't want my house smelling like my flowerbeds. One of my cats refused to use the litter at all. After the cats use the box the odor changes to urine soaked cypress mulch. It is just awful. There is no odor control at all. I scoop 2 litter boxes twice a day for 3 cats and the smell was so bad from the litter box I had to hold a cloth over my mouth and nose. Needless to say I still have most of the bag left. I changed to Ever Clean and have so far been very pleased. The only good thing I can say about this litter is that it is lightweight.",cats,2

"This isn't a bad product, and my slightly fat German Shepard doesn't hate it when I use these wipes on her teeth. To many dog owners, this is a grand slam.That doesn't mean this will suddenly make a dog's breath better. I think the only way they work is to use them in conjunction with something to get the crap off their teeth and to give them constant dental bones while still using this product. The problem is, I don't take care of my own teeth that well, so to do all of that for my dog...I'm giving it 4 stars since I can't say it doesn't work as noted in the reasons listed above. For the price, you might as well give it a shot.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you are wondering what else I do when I'm not cleaning my dogs teeth, you'll find me working on my book.

"I agree that if you have dogs who are ""pickers,"" these toys are not for you. If you have a dog like ours who just loves to shake and tug, this is great. The toy only says, ""OH NOOOOOOOO!"" Our dog has great timing and seems to use it as a commentary on something we just said, weird. It is also very funny for humans because that's what a toy should say if a dog is biting it. She loves it.",dogs,3

"Not only does it not work, but it had 4 splotches of gummy susbstance (like used to adhere things) on it that were dirty and obviously this had been returned before. We tried it out and it has a Low, Medium and High Setting. The most powerful setting was Medium, but even that is nothing. Our Golden Retriever literally stood on it without noticing it at all. 2 paws! So we tried it with bare feet and all it does is vibrate. He actually liked it because of the vibration. And yes, we used a new battery and then tested the battery also to make sure it was good (it was). I just don't expect to receive a used item when it is sold as new. Ugh.",dogs,3
"I was very happy with this crate for several years. It's easy to set up and comfortable and airy. That is until we left my yorkie in it while at a friend's house to come back and find that he'd chewed his way out. It was held together by a home made chainmail of zip ties for the trip home and a couple years after that, but we were afraid he'd hurt himself on the zip ties (he'd still try to get out) MOST of the time he was perfectly happy in here. It was meant to be for the car only, and for that it is perfect.",dogs,3

"My cat thinks that he is a dog. I swear he does. He loves to chew things, including my furniture. I don't think I have any table, dresser, nightstand or any other piece of furniture that the cat does not chew on. Solution... this kitty tree. It is huge, and don't let the ""fur"" thing scare you. I was afraid it would be that cheap fur covering, but its not. It is a very thick nice fur that looks better than the rug covering you expect in cat houses. The cats love it. Both of my guys climb all over it. It is especially amusing to see the one cat who gets on the top of the second cat house layer where he can get to the rope and runs himself on circles while laying on his side.I've written to the seller and asked about replacement pieces since my guy is a chewer... waiting to hear on that but overall, we love it... the kitties love it, and it has saved my home!Good delivery, and a nice touch was the note from the seller. They do genuinely seem to care that you purchased from them. I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again. Do yourself and your kitties a favor and buy this one.",cats,2
"Well, it's a bin, what can I say? They work fine. The LitterMaid comes with four of these in the box, but they are a little different. The included bins' lids never seem to stay on the bin cover.

"You dog lovers out there who live in NYC., this is for you!! We all have the task of cleaning up after our pets and most of us want to be reasonably 'green' about the way we do it. This is the PERFECT product. The bags come rolled in a beautifully compact package (I recommend the little refillable dispenser you can get for them for little cost). I have used them for 3 years and am extremely satisfied with them. They are surprisingly large and easy to use. I don't have to get my hands dirty I just put my hand inside the bag, pick up the poop, turn the whole thing inside out, find the nearest trash receptacle and VOILA!! Job done. Best of all,Bags on Board Regular Bag Refill Pack, 120 Biodegradable Bagsthe bags are biodegradeable so I feel like a responsible citizen, both for cleaning up after my dog and for using a green product to do it with AND they are CHEAP.

"I have 2 big Pit Bulls at home and they are way to big to keep in the house in the winter time. I ordered 2 of these to put 1 in each dog house. They were great!!!

At night when it's about 32 degrees, both dogs are in their houses toasty warm.",dogs,3

I really like this product & works well for my beagle. Any Beagle owners will tell you they are one of the most stubborn animals to get to listen . . . he hears the beep and runs right back to me and sits down. Only thing i woulc change is the distance incase he ever sprints out or gets a little too far away & make it waterproof.,dogs,3
"I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large. So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training. Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.The other important thing is the list of ingredients. They are not full of junk. In fact, there is NO junk in them. Just beef liver. I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.",dogs,3

Merial Frontline Top Spot Flea and Tick Control for Dogs is the only flea and tick product we have used over almost 20 years and half a dozen dogs. It has none of the ivermectin related potential hazards of Heartgard. We use no other flea products in the house or yard and have never found a flea on any of our dogs. They will occasionally pick up a tick when they romp in the forest but they don't attach.Merial Frontline Top Spot Flea and Tick Control for Dogs is also effective against several common canine worms.,dogs,3

Amazon is the only place I've seen it for sale. Compared to the auto-clean cat boxes, it is very reasonably priced. We have a friend that is a vet tech. She took care of our pets while we were out of town. She was totally amazed with the functionality. She was going to tell all the cat owners about it.",cats,2

"I ordered this for my dog (Cockapoo, with more prominent poodle genes) because she gets dry skin and starts biting herself to the point of baldness. I mix it right in with her food and she gobbles it up without an issue. This isnt exactly a miracle product, as it takes time and diligence for it to work, but it has helped my dog immensely. Her bald spots are starting to grow in, and although she is still itchy, its not as severe as before. Her hair is also a lot softer than it used to be; it used to be a little dry and coarse. If you have an itchy dog with skin issues, I would highly recommend this product.",cats,2
I will always order all my supplies from this vendor. A plus service delivered to you door step. Item exactly as described and also this is the best cat litter disposal system.

"I tried this pricey dog food for my Australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs. First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing. They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting. With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it. The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils. Certainly this was not worth the price tag.",dogs,3
"We have an 11 year old cairn terrier mix that loves to get out for walks daily, but she really starts lagging after a mile or so...solution to problem Solvit trailer. I hooked it up to my cruiser bike. Now we let her run for awhile and then put her in the trailer to rest. She loves it and jumps in no problem. We even put our 17 pound Yorkie in it occasionally. ( He's still young and is like the energizer bunny, so it's a short ride for him!) The trailer is very lightweight, well put together and is a snap to pop up or down. The trailer is stable and even with both dogs in the medium trailer ( about 50 pounds of weight) I can hardly feel I'm pulling anything I think this will last for many years. I am planning on buying another connector so that my husband and I can alternate the trailer from bike to bike.",cats,2
"This idea is great. The kids love it and it amuses many. The presentation is a little cheesy and less than refined but, this can be enjoyed because of the practicality of it.The transmitter -> receiver reception has a little to be desired. The product says that they can be 100 ft apart. If ours is more than 10 feet apart it doesn't work ( no chime). If the transmitter/receiver are around a corner/outside a door/or too far apart (10 ft) this system didn't work for us. We thought of returning it but then found a work around where we placed the chime next to the door (since it is loud enough to be heard throughout) and the paw at the door. In this set up, we can put the paw outside so that our pooch can tell us she needs to come inside without scratching. Thank you for that!!",dogs,3

"I would not recommend this item. I bought it one year ago. I was at the time hopeless regarding my two dogs barking. At this time they are even worse and I am considering shocking collars because they are driving me, my family and neighbors crazy. I just used this device for one month. Every time my dogs barked the light would turn on and the dogs would stop barking to look at the device. But at this time I think it was just curiosity, or maybe they got used to the noise (that I could not hear of course). They stopped caring about it within one week. They are two medium sized dogs, mixed breeds.",dogs,3

"After looking around at many different brands, I selected this one (manufactured by Kennel-Aire), and it's been great for my 60-lb hound. It meets all the airline rules, and even came with the stickers and dishes required (though not listed in the description). Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find any problems with flimsy door or missing parts, so this gets a 5-star rating from me. It's just what I expected.",dogs,3
"This thing is AMAZING. Seriously life changing. We have a 90 lb Lab who had major joint surgery and was put on severely limited activity for many months. Consequently, when we got the vet's okay to start leash walks, our dog was so excited and enthusiastic that he was a nightmare to walk. He completely pulled me off my feet more times than I'd care to admit, and if we came across another dog or person - forget about it. He'd pull so hard he'd choke himself and he would lunge at people and scare them (not being agressive, just wanted to meet them - but it'd still scare them to have a huge dog running towards them with me barely hanging on), and I was seriously starting to worry about dislocating a shoulder or elbow because he would pull so hard. Walks were completely miserable. In desperation I tried the Gentle Leader....and omg. The very first time we tried it I saw a 100 percent improvement. I thought for sure it was just a fluke, but low and behold we've been using it twice a day for a month now and the difference is AMAZING. Walks are actually pleasant now (for both of us). I can literally hold on to the leash with two fingers for our enitre walk. He doesn't lunge anymore and the pulling is nonexistant. Keeping him from ""meeting"" other people and dogs is a cinch. If he starts to pull I just give the leash a quick little tug and he stops. I could kiss the feet of the person who invented this. If you're going to buy this product, make sure you watch the DVD that comes with it - it's very helpful for learning how to fit the collar and how to use it.I did remove one star because after a month of twice-daily use the fur on the top of his nose is starting to rub off a little bit. But it's not bad and doesn't seem to bother him. I've been recommending this to everyone who stands still long enough to listen and would buy it again in a heartbeat.",dogs,3
We have used this wireless system for about 2 years. It works great. It is so EASY to use. My dog was trained in 2-3 days. It only took 2 shocks to get my dog to stay in the yard. He even stayed in the yard after the battery was dead. I would recommend this product to anyone.,dogs,3
"These work perfectly with the chuck-it device, they float, and they're pretty much indestructible. I lost one in a wooded area behind my house and found it about a year later. It had faded slightly, but is now back in the line-up of her regular use dog toys, just as good as if it were new. That ball has survived countless hours of chewing, hundreds of throws, and a full year of abuse in the elements (Canadian winter, scorching sun and everything in between).Expensive for what they are, but unless you lose 'em, you will not likely ever have to find a replacement.",dogs,3
"My 10 month old Golden loves this toy. He enjoys pulling out the eggs from the shark and then ""munching"" on the eggs. The eggs are a nice shape and size i.e. just fits in his mouth but not too small so that he is in danger of swallowing them whole. I would have liked the seams of the shark toy to be stronger and the lining made out of tougher material. The poor shark was torn in less than 15 minutes!",dogs,3
"I'm using this on a dog that's allergic to EVERYTHING. I'm very happy with the product (and the seller, Ozbo). It's very concentrated and keeps the dog smelling nice longer than other shampoos.

He happily carries it around the house, occasionally attacking it, showing the toy who's boss, yet other times he brings it to us so we can hold on to the handle while he slobbers and chews on the other end. The toy is well made but I doubt it will last more than a few months. I guess in the end that's longer than most toys last with him. Thanks again Jolly!",dogs,3

"I have bought countless toys for my cat, and invariably, after one or two days, he got bored with them. I've had this for over a month now, and he plays with it constantly. Everyone loves watching him jump around and pounce on it, it's quite entertaining watching your cat think a toy is going to somehow jump away before he can get to it. I highly recommend this toy, I'm glad I listened to the other positive reviews. We had a similar toy to this made of cheaper plastic, but the ball just didn't go around quite as smoothly, and he got bored with it. The ball on this one will go around about 6 times after he pushes it, entertaining him. The scratch pad does need to be replaced, (he actually USES this one rather than my couch now) so I suggest buying a few replacements with it. As a matter of fact, I just purchased 4 extra packages of pads (8) to hold us over for the next 6 months or so, and that's why I'm here writing this review! Definitely worth the money since it is used, and since I only have the one cat, I like to see that he is occupied and active as much as possible when I'm not able to play with him.",cats,2

His weight is down to where it should be now because I control how much he gets each day.",dogs,3
"I bought this product to occupy my 13-month-old mix. She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough. When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour. At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces. While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does. Especially for eleven dollars!",dogs,3

"The description says its 7"" from end to end, well not by my tape measure, if I really pull on it I can get it to 6"". This looks like a beaver not a squirrel and it more of a cat toy.

"I'm not sure why others are having bad experiences with this carbon bag, I got a 511 and it came with the bag, I put it in the way the instructions said to that came with the filter and I just changed the bag with a new one after over a month ago {March/31}...anyway it has done an amazing job keeping my turtle aquarium {18x24x14} clean and smell free. One thing I noticed when I got the new carbon bag was that on the box it says to put the carbon bag above the ceramic media, on my 511 instructions it says to put the ceramic media on top of the carbon bag ...I'm not sure what the difference is between the two filters that would require the two to differentiate in how they are placed in the canisters. Not sure if that's a reason for the bad experiences others have had. All I can say, I highly recommend it for the 511 filter with the ceramic on top.***********************************UPDATE*************UPDATE***************UPDATE*****************UPDATE************************I dont know what is different from this bag and the one that came with the filter but this is different... the one that came with the filter worked fantastic, this one is worthless it does nothing.

"My 2 new cats were a rescue from neglect. They are 2 huge Maine Coons, 6 yrs., and siblings. The male (20lbs) unpacked within the first hour, moved in and wanted lunch. The female (17lbs) hid. Both were infested with fleas, ticks, and roundworm. She had good reasons to hide because she also had an upper respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, and a urinary tract infection. This is what happens when people think that their domestic pets can survive outdoors for long periods of time. They cannot. The female would have died before winter.After a month of anti-biotics, flea, tick and roundworm treatments, her diseases were healed but not her psyche. Her brother liked to pick on her and she would growl like a mountain lion. She even scared me. I've had cats for 40 years and this is the first time I questioned my safety with one.But I knew part of her reaction was stress from all the changes - new home, new food, warm bed, a host of sicknesses, etc. Nevertheless, I needed to get on top of the stressful behavior or they were going to be permanently separated with the female going to a new home. He was a lover right from the start. I didn't know what she was because she was freaked out. Sleep deprivation was also turning me into zombie.A Google search turned up this product. It was serendipitous that this product was the first hit, because I study the same types of odors in humans (scientist); they're called human semiochemicals and pheromones (this product) are one class of semiochemical. At any rate, had this product Fed-Exed to me and all I can say is WOW.Within 12 hours all stress levels dropped by a factor of 10. For the first time in 6 weeks both animals slept through the night without an 'argument' and I, too, got my first full night's sleep since bringing them home. It's been 2 days now and both animals are completely chilled out.I've decided to bomb my entire house and put a diffuser in each room in order to maintain this blissful state for the next 60 days with the expectation that both animals will transition into calmness without any further need for the product after this time period. If it turns out that stress begins to increase, I'll just continue using the product in the rooms where they spend most of their time.While the female is still 'tetchy', she is phenomenally less stressed and can be handled. Because of this product, I won't have to separate these two lovely animals and also will not have to resort to Valium for her.While this product may not work for long standing stress situations where bad behaviors have been allowed to continue for years, it is an amazing product for recent changes. It seems to me that all shelters and rescue organizations might benefit from this product and its canine counterpart to relieve shelter stress. Highly recommended - it is science (not hocus pocus), backed up by empirical tests, and it works.",cats,2

"My pup figured out right away that this little heat pad was oh so comfy. It's not hot. It's just right, as described. I suppose it mimics momma yorkie's warm belly. I put it in his bed and placed it under a towel and the heat comes through nicely. When he outgrows his puppy bed I will look for beds that have a zip off cover or pouch for pads like this to slip into. He does chew on the cord, just as he chews on every other cord = puppy. So I've ordered the Grannick's Bitter Apple chew deterrent to spray on this cord, ....and every other cord in the house.",dogs,3
"I was a bit skeptical of this box at first, but also desperate for a better way to handle litter so I tried it. It's really easy to use - put it together, add litter, and wait for the cats to use it. Then roll it over to the right and then back and pull out the drawer full of clumps. That's it.I had a few problems at first. I was rolling too fast and a lot of clean litter ended up in the trash drawer. Rolling it over slowly fixed that problem. My cats like to pee on the sides of their boxes and to remove that you simply give the outside bottom of the box a good thump when you roll it over.I bought the regular-size version for my regular cat, but my jumbo-size cat wants in everything and he uses it too. He's accidentally pooed on the floor twice when he thought he was inside the box but wasn't quite, but that's the only accident so far. I like it so much that I'll be getting him his own jumbo-sized version.The cats track less litter out of this box than they do the uncovered pan they also use. Probably because there isn't room to play in it (yuck!).The only downside, and the reason I rated this 4 stars is that the latches are flimsy and have come undone - glad I noticed before I rolled it over. Otherwise it'd get 5 stars.Update",cats,2

"For those unhappy about the texture of the 2nd step food, if you read the instructions on the can, it says that you're supposed to mix the 2nd step with KMR liquid OR with water. I have done the KMR + KMR 2nd Step mixture with two feral kittens I rescued at ~4 weeks (started 2nd step at 5 weeks) and they have doubled in size and weight in just over two weeks. I mix 50% KMR powder and 50% 2nd step with warm water and it creates a smooth liquid that the kittens love. I've been mixing it with a little less water over time so that they get used to ""chewier"" food. I've just today started mixing in canned kitten food and reducing the water a little bit, mixing everything with a whisk. This is how I plan to slowly transition the kittens to kitten food (Wellness).

"I HAVE USED PRONG TYPE TRAINING COLLARS IN THE PAST, LIKE SPRENGER'S FOR GERMAN SHEDHERD SCHUTZHUND TRAINING, BUT THAT WAS 30 YEARS AGO. SINCE THEN I RAISED STANDARD POODLES AND DIDN'T NEED THAT TYPE OF TRAINING CONTROL, HOWEVER I HAVE A 6 MONTH OLD STANDARD POODLE, MALE THAT'S ALREADY ABOUT 60LBS AND WILL PROBABLY REACH 110+LBS, HE'S STRONG AS A BULL, BUT NEEDS TO BE TRAINED TO PERFORM SERVICE WORK. I COULDN'T AFFORD THE NEW TEC NECK SPRENGER COLLARS AND DIDN'T WANT TO USE THE PRONG TYPE SO I FOUND THIS STARMARK COLLAR, FOR $12, IT WAS THE BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT, I CAN'T COMPARE IT TO THE SPRENGER TEC NECK COLLAR--BUT THAT COSTS ABOUT $85, SO IT ISN'T IN THE SAME CATAGORY.TRY THIS STARMARK, IT WORKS REALLY WELL AND IS THE LEAST EXPENSE TRAINING COLLAR OUT THERE!",dogs,3
We have two cats less than a year old. They LOVE Da Bird! I've never seen them get so excited about anything. The effort they make to catch Da Bird is amazing. They jump so high and often do a complete a 360 flip in the air to catch the toy in their mouth and/or paws. This cat toy has become the go to toy for our cats. They will play with it until they are both laying on the floor panting like dogs. They even try to get into the closet where we keep Da Bird. Great exercise for cats of any age.,cats,2

"My CatMate Autofeeder also did not work. I tested it before I left to make sure my cats would get fed, but after the bowl ran through one 5-meal cycle it stopped working.Also the packaging claims that it is tamper-proof, my cat managed to slide the opening around and eat 2 days worth of food at once.I returned this product very quickly.",cats,2
Beware of this product. It is not worth buying. The product had a very very strong odor like a pesticide. It was very runny while applying on my cat. She did not like it and ran away after only about half the product was added. Hours later little did I know but I notice a red spot on my cats skin where the product was applied. I will not be using this product again on any animal. It is not worth a dime paying for.,cats,2

And if I was selling medication online and used the title Revival Animal Health, at minimum I would be selling things FOR ANIMALS!!!",cats,2
"First, I have to say that this device looks atrocious. It is straight out of a 60's B-Movie about space exploration. It also looks like they could slap any logo on it and claimed it did anything they wanted to. However, it actually works with our dog. I have used it because he will bark and he doesn't always come when called. Every time he barks, I give the button one tap and he stops immediately - I don't even show him the device. His barking is way down since we got it. Similarly, when he doesn't come, a quick tap on the button and he comes running. I can actually see him reacting so I know the device is working.On the whole this is a much better solution for us that the shock collar. Those worked, but had to be turned on and chewed through batteries. This is cheaper and equally effective.",dogs,3

"and be certain who you are really dealing with when buying THROUGH Amazon.com. I have always been happy with my purchases through Amazon. com DIRECTLY. When I bought this, I did not bother to REALLY read the return policy of My Health Pet Supplies, because I trusted. My cats did not like the drinking fountain, and the adapter that plugs into the wall gets really hot, and we were worried leaving it on all the time because of possibility of fire. My Health Pet Supplies' return policy is they will only aceept UNUSED, UNOPENED items. So how am I to check and know if the item will work for me? Plus there is a 20% processing fee, plus you will have to absorb all shipping costs. I tried to approach the manufacturer, HAGEN, as suggested by My Health Pet Supplies but (Hagen)claim they do not have a direct dealing with (My Health) company- I don't know what that means! Even if My Pet Health Supplies agreed to accept the return, which cost me over $38.00, there will be nothing left by the time they refund my money. We ended up absorbing all costs and kept the item, even if we cannot use them.",cats,2
"My siberian husky is very strong and he loves to pull. When I first put this collar on him, he took one step forward, then turned back and looked at me quizzically. Then he took another step forward, turned back and looked at me. Then he sat down. I didn't move at all this whole time. For the first two weeks he stopped pulling. He's a bit too clever though, he knows if he does that shaking motion that dogs do when they're wet, the collar will slide from the top of his neck down to his shoulders, and then it doesn't hurt him to pull at all. So now I'm using a second regular collar to hold this collar higher up his neck. We'll see if he figures out a way around this....Anyway, this says &#34;medium&#34; but my dog is 54 pounds and I had to take two of the prongs off for it to fit him.

"It took my dog more than an hour to make it through each of his first two ever-lasting treats. I thought the ever-locking treats would slow him down even more. Not so. Because the edges of the disc pieces are scalloped (rather than smooth like the ever-lasting treats), they don't stay wedged down in the ball as well. My dog can get the first one out in less than five minutes. You'd think the twisting ""lock"" would at least add some complexity, but you'd be wrong. As soon as my dog chomped through the first disc, he shoved the ""stick"" back through the ball, using it to pop out disc number two. It probably would have taken him longer to wolf down the entire contraption if I'd just handed the treats to him in their original packaging. Fabulous idea; poor results.",dogs,3
"We have two high energy dogs that absolutely go crazy for a Frisbee game. The downside is they destroy the cheap ones in about 2-3 tosses. So we finally stumbled upon this brand and have bought several for our dogs throughout the years. Also for a time, we would both get back late, so we purchased two of the glow in the dark ones. Then, the dogs could still have their game, even if it was dark outside (also good for the summers down south, when it is still 90+ degrees at sunset).One little tip to make the glow-in-the-dark model work better",dogs,3
"I bought one of the 69 quart containers last summer and am very pleased with it! It holds 30# of food with no issues and seems to be very good quality. I haven't had any issues with it not being airtight or cracking or anything, plus I love that it rolls around. One of my dogs, a big collie/shepherd mix, is a food hound and will do anything for a few more bites. But now I have no issues with him helping himself to snacks or spilling it. I have two dogs that eat different foods, so I plan to order another container. I also have one of the 33 quart containers and I love it even more. My other dog is a husky and she can get into just about anything, so I'm using the container as a trash can for ""yummy"" trash - cat/dog food cans, mainly. Until she figures out how to open the lid, I'm set - and at a fraction of the cost of a ""dog proof"" trash can that usually isn't very dog proof. Not having to round up old cans after leaving her home alone is a lifesaver!",dogs,3

"I haven't even had this for a week, and I'm already impressed with how much easier it makes things. I have a somewhat skittish rescue dog who has a deep love of hiking and water, and who especially tends to romp around in the areas most likely to result in fleas. Tweezing or hand-removing ticks from her was kind of an exercise in zenlike patience, since she doesn't like being held still to get precise enough to remove the ticks safely.With this simple piece of plastic, I can be distracting her with affection while I simply find my target by touch. A quick slide and twist, and the ticks have come off quite easily (and mostly alive, which is a good sign their heads are still attached).So maybe this thing seems overpriced to be a small piece of plastic--and going strictly by materials costs, it definitely is--but it's worth every penny and more in the convenience it brings.",dogs,3

I found this to be very helpful for dealing with a foster dog who was not cooperative about teeth brushing. These allowed me to do a sort of sneak it into her mouth. They are not really cost effective but they are a great temporary solution while your dog is getting used to the idea of teeth brushing. They will not accomplish the same good that an actual brush will but they are what they are and that is much better than nothing! They fit my hand great and I am average to large frame sized woman. If you are a big guy I think you might have trouble with these.,dogs,3
"We absolutely LOVE Merrick pet food. But the third party reseller is either criminal in their handling of the packages and so rough that the package opens in the corners OR they know the package is open and ship it anyway. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with the former. If you handle the bags from the corners/top, then the packaging will open on you. Guess they don't know or have the muscles to pick the bag up by the middle. So from now on, no more ordering Merrick from Amazon.",cats,2

"I bought this product after reading the good reviews here because I wanted to train my cat to stop pestering me before meal times. The product did a great job of that ... the cat learned within a couple of days to associate the sound of the motorized tray with food and would jump up from whatever she was doing (including a deep sleep) and trot over to eat. The feeder allowed me to disassociate myself from the feeding, and also provide two meals at exactly the same times each day, and my cat became noticeably more relaxed as a result.My cat is pretty large and is a good door and cupboard opener, and she spent the first couple days dragging the feeder around the kitchen floor trying to break into it, but she was not able to. After that she stopped trying. Even when leaving her alone for a weekend she was not able to break in.However, our problem showed up later and I wanted to warn other cat owners. A week after switching to the new feeder, I noticed a small bald spot on her chin. I took her to the vet, who told me not to worry about it. However, the bald spot grew and eventually revealed a large, nasty looking lump, so I tried a different vet who diagnosed ""feline acne"" and prescribed a heavy regimen of cleanings and antibiotics. At the end of the visit one of the receptionists said, ""Does she have a plastic food bowl?"" and we all slapped our foreheads ... the new feeder! Apparently it is fairly common for plastic bowls to cause infections on cats' chins, which makes sense because this cat had always used a ceramic bowl before.We immediately moved back to a ceramic bowl and eventually bought a Super Feeder, which comes with a steel bowl and also lets you use any bowl you want. However, now I'm $400 poorer from vet bills, and it's too late to return this product.I can't be sure the new feeder caused this problem, but she had never had a problem like this before, and the symptoms started within a week of starting with it. So, I would recommend that you try the product, but watch your cat closely for a while to make sure it is not causing any problems, and return it immediately if you see these symptoms.",cats,2
"I have a short-haired boxer/lab mix and she sheds a decent amount for a short-haired dog. Using this brush on her gets out tons of loose hair in a very short time. Very easy to use, just have the dog sit near you and with very little pressure just brush along their back and sides. As a bonus my dog must love the feeling of the brush as well since she'll just sit there very calmly while I brush her out. After 5 minutes or so I'll have a pile of loose hair and her coat will be very smooth and soft.",cats,2
"When the mat first arrived I thought, this is weird, but then after following the instructions for set up, I thought it was pretty cool. Only problem was, after use for about a month, the mat lost it's heat, and the foam pad inside kept shifting, twisting and bunching up. I'm thinking the twisting and such might have caused some problems with the wiring inside and that's why it lost it's heat. Ultimately, I am returning it and probably going to buy one of the hard ""Original Lectro-Kennel"" pads. I have a small one for my rabbit, and even though it's hard, I just toss a little blanket over it and he likes it so hopefully I can toss a thin pad over the hard Lectro-Kennel warming pad and still get a little softness and the warmth too, without the problems.",dogs,3

"These are a big hit with my dogs. I fill them with soft dog food and freeze them overnight. I crate the dogs while I'm at work, and this gives them something to do. I like these better than the traditional KONG beehive shape because it seems like it is easier for the dogs to get the ball completely cleaned out. That means I don't have to worry about old bits of food being stuck inside and festering, even if I only wash them every couple of days.The large ball holds a little over 1/2 can of dog food, and is probably appropriate for 50 to 90 pound dog. The small ball hold about 1/4 can, and is probably appropriate for anything smaller. By ""appropriate"" I mean that the ball is big enough for the dog to get its tongue into, but small enough to still be a bit of a challenge.Also, and this is probably obvious, but make sure you get the ""ground"" dog food, not the stuff with chunks and juice.",dogs,3

"Well - it's Frontline Plus. You can't really say any more than that - this is an excellent product and one that will solve MOST of your flea-related problems, as well as kill ticks.However - here's the kicker. After a year and three months of using this product religiously every month on our dog (Beagle-Jack Russell, 1.5yrs old), I suddenly started finding very much alive fleas on her. In the past two days, I have picked FIVE alive fleas off her. A search around Google dug up a suggestion that fleas may become locally resistant to certain anti-flea medications used on dogs and cats. A possible way to combat this is to rotate - or swap out - your flea medication every year or so. So - this seems to have been what has happened to us. We moved to K9 Advantix, although it's only been two hours since application of the first dose so I can't say how well that will work.",dogs,3

"I have a 140 gallon salt water aquarium with only 4 fish in it, and I believe the tank is too ""small"" to put in another fish. An aquarium is not simply ""entertainment"" but a responsibility. Living, breating souls are put in an aquarium and while they may not be mental giants, fish can and do feel lonely, frustrated and bored just like other animals - AND like all other moving, breathing animals, they need a way to rest their eyes by gazing near and far and a way to ""stretch their legs."" No fish that you can buy in the trade is going to be comfortable with a width of 3 1/8"" inches. Most fish need to swim constantly to stay alive - and to go back and forth like a caged panther, the fish will have to twist itself in an unnatural way every time it goes back and forth across the tank. This is a recipe for a fish that will literally try to kill itself by leaping out of the top of the tank to stop the pain and discomfort of daily living.Whoever designed this aquarium should be fined by the USPCA for designing a cruel and unusual punishment device for animals. Just because you can't hear a fish complain does not mean it is not unhappy. Imagine being unhappy for your entire life. Unhappy, stressed fish, quickly develop cancerous lesions and tumors.If you want fish as entertainment, go to Long John Silvers to eat them or go to Sea World to watch them - but if you're going to take on the responsibility of taking care of living creatures in your home - do so with compassion. This tank is just pure idiotic - and the smaller a tank is, the HARDER it is to care for, anyway. Splurge a little and get a 30 gallon tank (minimum) - the bigger the tank, the EASIER it is to maintain because small shifts in chemical balances don't make that much of a difference the bigger your tank is.If you want a tiny aquarium in your wall like this, you can get a Mac Mini and a small monitor and use the Marine Aquarium screensaver - it's realistic and nothing has to suffer for your entertainment.This tank is just cruel. It's like having to live your life in a one bedroom loft with no separate toilet, kitchen or closet - FOREVER without being allowed to leave. They have places like these for people - they're called maximum security prisons. No animal deserves this type of barbaric treatment.",fish aquatic pets,4

These are perfect. I have a Husky pup and a Chow mix and they love them. I got the 30x21 for my 7 mth old Husky and she will curl up on it when she is in the mood. I ordered the smaller one so it would only cover half the crate and she can move to the cooler crate flooring if she gets hot. I love the pink color. Its really cute. She got it muddy after a few days and I threw it in the washer and none of the stuffing moved. When I took it out of the dryer it looked like new. I got the 36x23 for my chow mix for his XL foldable crate. He loves it too and the baby blue is very pretty also. I love these and when they wear out I will order more. These are especially great for dogs that prefer the cooler weather as they are not to fluffy and they don't get hot too fast. Also great for inside travel crates.,cats,2
"My pups love this dog bed. It is very durable and the perfect size. It doesn't stick out as far as the round beds, so the oval shape is perfect for choosing a location of the dog bed. The best point of course is the pink color! Enjoy.",dogs,3
"I have yet to encouter a dog that doesn't enjoy Dingos. From the youngest puppy to the oldest senior, they all have loved the various Dingo bones and treat.The biggest challenge is buying a size big enough to prevent the dog from eating it rather than chewing it. This is not true of all dogs, but if the dog has food or treat issues it can be a consideration. They really lovethese treats and seem to not want to be patient or risk not getting the entire bone. And most of the dogs I have given these to also tend to want to chew them from start to finish, so I do have to take the treat away from a dog occasionally.There are Dingo imitators out there that cost less, but I have yet to find one that is of similar quality. I have tried a couple and will continue to sample others, but so far there is not a generic Dingo equivalent.",dogs,3
"We bought this for our german shepherd dog when he was about 5 months old. He was cutting through (and eating) practically every toy he had from thick knotted ropes, to ""invincible rings""-lasted MAYBE 10 minutes- tennis balls, and so on.THIS IS THE TOY TO GET FOR HEAVY CHEWERS!! Our dog is now almost a year old and this toy is the only one that has lasted that we allow him access to at all times. He pulls at the very small part at the top and has been able to tear tiny pieces from there, but keep in mind, it's taken him 6 months to do so where as many of the other toys couldn't last a full hour.",dogs,3
"I bought the excell senior vitamin supplements for my two 11 year old dogs and they love them! They are pretty picky when it comes to medicines and vitamins, but they eat these no problem and even think they are treats! I asked my vet and did research online for which vitamins are the best for small-breed older pups and the ingredients in these vitamins are great for them! They really have some great stuff in there. Particularly the lutein for their eyes and glucosamine for their joints. There are other vitamins present in this dog supplement that are also in my human vitamins, and I love giving them things of human quality. I feed these to my dogs whole as a ""treat"" right before dinner, for optimum absorption. Many other reviews commented on the fact that they are quite crumbly and break easily. This is very true, but if does happen you can just sprinkle the powder onto their food and add a tiny bit of water so it sticks to the kibble. I kind of liked the fact that it crumpled a bit so I can sprinkle a small amount on to my cats food too! There are more solid vitamins out there that are just as nutritious, so if the crumpling is an issue, this might night be the vitamin for you and your dogs. This was not however, and issue for us, as I think the soft-ness was what made my dogs like them so much (avoided the hard ""pill"" like texture).:D",dogs,3
"I have an 18 year old Siamese cat who has developed hairball problems in the last year or so. She is pretty finicky, but likes this food.

"My lil' Amy was a rescue kitten found abandon on the side of the road. She looked pitiful and sickly when I got her since her hair was thin and patchy. I couldn't help but fall in love with the poor thing, and trying to nurse her back to health. Unfortuantely, she had constant diarrhea and I ended up trying several brands of kitten food before finally setting on Purina ONE's sensitive formula for kittens. She blossomed beautifully with the stuff- growing a thick fur coat and had no more litter problems. After she grew out of the kitten stage, and since money was tight, I put her on Whiskas. While she loved it and looked fine, I wasn't monitoring her food and she grew really fat and lazy. When I gave her less, she would constantly meow at her empty bowl.I bought Purina ONE's weight/hairball formula and gave her the amount of food she wanted to eat. Even with a minimal decrease in food intake, she started losing weight within a few weeks, and is finally down to a normal weight a few months later. She seems to be a more active as well. I rarely hear any hairball-hacking, even though she spends most of the day grooming herself. Best of all, my fellow cat-owning friends have asked what brand of food and shampoo I use since her fur is super shiny and very silky. It is well worth the few extra dollars a month for food since I ended up with a healthier cat.",cats,2

"This is a wonderful, witty and durable (for a soft toy) dog toy. My dog loves it, and I get a huge kick out of seeing her with it. So the product gets five stars -- great like all Fat Cat items. However, like others, I was very disappointed to receive Hillary toys instead of George W. toys not once but twice! Amazon was great about taking them back the first time and sending replacements -- but the replacements were wrong too and I finally gave up. (When I looked at the tags, I saw the tags on Hillary were mistakenly labeled and bar coded as the George W. ones; it's clear all they do is scan that rather than actually looking at what they're packing and making sure it matches the order.) But if Amazon were to contact me and say they're sure they fixed this, I'd order them again in a flash!",dogs,3

"The rubber base smells like janitorial perfume mixed with something foul and it remains after a thorough washing.

"I had Big Dog water fountain for a little over 2 years for my 3 cats. The fountain was good, however, I had a piece break about a year into use. It was not a vital part (the switch to make faster or slower water flow) so I kept it. The Big Dog fountain was hard to clean and very clumsy. I bought all of the tools that Drinkwell sells and did not have an easier time. I found myself not wanting to re-fresh their bowl, which is unfortuate.I moved and did not want to move Big Dog so I looked for a new fountain. I found this one on Amazon and really liked the videos I watched on YouTube for this product. Plus I liked that the unit is dishwasher safe. This fountain is quieter than Big Dog, smaller than Big Dog, and much easier to clean. Plus I like the hair catcher. The fountain is shorter so my cats have to bend their necks further, which is not a deal at all - I should hope. My cats love the fountain as much as they loved the last. I do not use all of the Drinkwell cleaning pieces with this unit - most used is the middle sized brush. The pieces come apart for easy clean, which less clumsy than Big Dog. It uses the same filters as the other fountains like Big Dog, which is also good because they are sometimes hard to come by.My only complaint is the size of the reserve tank. I wish it held as much as the Big Dog tank did. This is not a big deal at all because it is super easy to fill and replace.",cats,2

"I bought a Thundershirt and an Anxiety Wrap for my two Airedales. While both products worked in helping to calm the dogs during a thunderstorm, the Thundershirt was much easier to use. Just place it on the back of the dog, then fasten the velcro straps. No problem at all.The Anxiety Wrap, however, was almost impossible to get on an already anxious dog. You have to place it over the dog's head, then pull the legs up through the leg holes, then fasten. I know it sounds easy and the video at their excellent web site makes it look easy, but it isn't, particularly with a dog that's worked up. Getting the Anxiety Wrap on stressed out the dog almost as much as the storm did!Both products worked, but the design of the Thundershirt is much more user-friendly. Having used both products, I strongly recommend Thundershirt over Anxiety Wrap.",dogs,3
"I have a husky, a breed notorious for pulling, and my dog was no exception. However, with this harness, the problem simply disappeared the first time we tried it. The harness fits him very comfortably; however, has a very narrow, deep chest so it might not fit all dog body types perfectly. I know some people have said this rubs their dogs raw but, when properly fitted, I have had no problems even on many-hour long hikes, and it fits nicely underneath his backpack without shifting around. I originally got the med/large for him when he was younger and now that he has outgrown it, I will happily purchase the extra large size. This is one of my favorite pet products!",dogs,3

"I have a australian shepherd that loves toys, she lives for them, she loves to catch and fetch, she isn't much of a chewer. I've tried all varieties of Kong balls and this football is by far her favorite. I give the product five stars because it is exactly as described, the tennis felt is much thicker than regular tennis balls and there is no squeaker pillow inside of this ball, in fact the way it squeaks is at the tip of this ball there is a very small hole and a plastic squeaker is hidden there, so the way the dog makes these squeak is to simply bite down on it, my dog also likes to push down on it with her nose to make it squeak. This toy is not a chew toy, it is a fetch toy. The plush toys with the squeaker pillow are for me a waste of time, Dakota (my dog) can feel the squeaker pillow with her nose and she immediately sets out to get it and destroys the toy. This toy lasts much longer for her enjoyment than any of the others. I noticed other reviewers were upset their dogs destroyed the toy, if you have a big dog bent on destroying something, it's going to be destroyed, so with that in mind, if your dog loves to catch and fetch, and is a larger dog (this toy is fairly big) this may be the toy for your dog. If your dog likes to sit and chew on a toy, this toy is not for your dog.For small dogs, my mom has 3 pomeranians, and they love the small Kong air squeakers Kong Air Squeaker Tennis Ball Dog Toy small yellow-color 2"" diameter 3-count, they push down on them with their noses to squeak them, they last her dogs for months, because her little dogs like to chew on their toys on occasion and they eventually can get the felt off of these.If you have the expectation that your large dog loves to destroy toys and won't be able to destroy this one, it's not a reasonable expectation. These are more durable, they are tougher than regular toys, but they are not indestructible.If you are looking for something on the tough side, I recommend theKONG Ball Dog Toy, Medium/Large, RedKong rubber ball. I had one of these, had left it in the yard, ran over it with the lawn mower, and it stopped my lawn mower in its tracks. The blade went into the ball and got stuck there. I picked up the ball and it had a small slit at the top. These are about as indestructible as dog toys can get. The downside for us was that the toy is simply not a fetch toy, it's too heavy and not really safe for Dakota to jump up and catch in her mouth. It's meant for chewing.I hope this helps to decide if this toy is for you.",dogs,3
I have a 100 gallon tank and I paid 500.00 for a wet/dry system that everyone swore would be my last and best filter. Well after a year of loud draining noises and yellow water I ditched it and put on 2 of the XP2's. All I can say is WOW!!!! After only 9 hours my water is crystal clear! I was so used to the yellow tinge in the water I forgot what clear water looked like! My wet dry was rated for a 200 gallon tank and I changed the media religously! It pales in comparison to the XP2's! And the XP2's along with a year supply of filter media cost less than half of the Wet/Dry system! I am sold on the XP2! They are virtually noiseless too!,fish aquatic pets,4

"I have been working with cats for over 40 years and run a boarding and rescue kennel. If you're looking for the toy to exercise that hyper-active cat, or pique the curiosity of the bored cat, or just want your cat to have a great time, stock up on ""Da Bird""...just be careful not to get them too excited near furniture with sharp corners because they have so much fun leaping into the air to catch it they forget to see where they will land!!! Play safe and get the original! Sometimes they don't twirl just right, but get several and examine the position of the feathers of the ones that sound and look like a bird in flight and then just tweak the ones that don't do it perfectly. I have used 'da bird' for cat therapy of pacing cats by giving them daily exercise/play for 10 minutes in am and 15 minutes in pm to relieve extreme boredom of cats that are actually overly intelligent and pace and and cry. Nothing works better than da bird! THey ALWAYS want to play with it! There is no substitute...the others just haven't figured out the secret of 'da bird.'",cats,2

"When my vet reccommended Dasuquin,for my shepherd,she diagnosed her with arthritis andstiffness in her hip and knee with possible early signs of hip dysplasia. I have to admit that I reeled at the cost at her office. She wanted $20 for 150 count. When I did some research, I found Dasuquin with MSM online, and gladly ordered a 150 ct. bottle for half of that. She was limping after resting from exercise, and favoring her hind leg. As time goes on, its gotten somewhat better and I truly beleive, what x-rays don't show, is a possible torn ligament in my dog's stiffle(knee).. much like a torn acl in humans.I have seen good success feeding these tablets. She likes the flavor and no objections whatsoever eating them. As reccommended from the vet, I started her out on 2 a day for 2 weeks, and now just one a day for maintenance. I didn't see overnight responses, but it does take time for the body to assimulate the vitamins for the joints.. just like in people.I saw no adverse reactions and think this is a superior quality product. For dogs with hip or stiffle or elbow problems, there isn't much to do, when you love a pet.. you want to give them the best, sometimes, our income doesn't allow to pull all the stops and go for all the surgeries the vets suggest.Hope this helps to others looking for an alternative. This won't make your old dog a puppy again, but it will help them in many ways getting up and mobile. My shepherd loves her ball chasing, and running like a race horse.. with a set back of soreness in her hip/stiffle, I have had to limit her running, and just go on walks with her.. Together with Dasuquin and moderation in exercise, have seen good results.",dogs,3

"Awesome balls, way better than your standard tennis ball. My 50lb rescue mutt is a ball fanatic, but will choose these over a tennis ball EVERY time. They're not solid rubber, they are inflated, and he likes to chew on them like bubblegum when he's tired or we stop playing. These throw like tennis balls (not super heavy like a solid rubber ball), but have a great bounce.If you ever go to a dog park, be sure to bring more than one - many dogs who otherwise show no interest in balls will LOVE to steal these. If you have more than one, the game can continue. Just keep an eye on the thief - these are too expensive to 'donate' to another dog or the park!These are worth the price compared to tennis balls. Tennis balls from sports stores have been treated with chemicals that are not good for the dogs. Any tennis ball (including those from pet stores) will hold dirt/debris in the fuzz, which will act as sandpaper on your dog's teeth and over time wear them down significantly (the fuzz on sport tennis balls will also do that, even when clean).",dogs,3

I have been trying to keep one of my cats off of the counter for years now. At last - this products works. I especially like that it has an audible sound as well as an aerosol spray. I started with both the sound and spray. Now I am using just the audible sound. Occasionally I hear the alarm sound followed by the thumping sound of my cat jumping off of the counter.

"I have a 2 year old shepard mix that I recently adopted from a local shelter. After a couple of weeks, she started showing signs of separation anxiety when I would leave for work. I slowly introduced her to this toy by opening it up and stuffing each half with a treat (one half while I was getting ready to leave, and the other when I did leave). She's so preoccupied that her anxiety has nearly diminished and now she's interested in it enough that I completely enclose it and it takes her a while to open it up. By the time she's finished, she hasn't even noticed that I've left. She's not an aggressive chewer at all, but just gets anxious when I leave and probably bored throughout the day. This chew toy has been extremely helpful and I highly recommend it to anyone with similar issues.",dogs,3

"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.",dogs,3

"First I should say that if this stuff really works, then it is a godsend. A vet told me I should brush my cat's teeth daily, and I tried it a couple of times. That was enough. I was glad I had had the foresight to don a long-sleeved jacket first.So I got this powder in hopes that it would do what my brushing technique could not. I sprinkled a tiny bit on Goofball's food, and he reluctantly ate some of it, but experiments with two bowls demonstrated that he really didn't like it. He has to get pretty hungry before he'll eat food even lightly dusted with this stuff. We never got anywhere near the recommended dose.Goofball is kind of a picky eater, so I can't fault the product too much, but it didn't really work for us. I have neighbors with dogs -- perhaps they'll like it.",cats,2

"I'm between two and three stars on this one.My cat likes to bury her business really well, I guess, so she digs around a little bit after she uses the litter box. So far, this has completely destroyed the clumping effect. Instead of one or possibly two, giant, hard chunks for each time she pees like I would get with clay litters, I get about 15 teeny tiny ones. Since there are so many and they're so small, its nearly impossible to remove completely with scooping, so I could see how it could start to smell bad (I haven't been using it long enough to tell.) Scooping even one 'session' up also takes quite a while.However, so far it has done fine to control smells and the litter itself smells pretty good. It seems a little dusty, but no more than the litter, and I like that there is no strip mining involved in harvesting this product. I prefer having a box of it in my house to a box of the perfumey, dusty, dirty clay litter. Also, my cat doesn't seem to mind it at all.Unfortunately, the poor clumping ability will probably cause the litter to get dirty much faster than clay and need to be thrown out. Because of this, I'll probably keep trying different brands.I do want to like it, though, so I'm kind of just holding out and hoping my cat will decide she doesn't want to dig through her pee anymore. Yeah right.And on the bugs",cats,2

"Now in our late 50's, we recently acquired our first puppy ever - and first dog in over 20 years. Needless to say, we had old-fashioned ideas on how to raise our Belgian Malinois (yes, call us crazy for selecting this breed as novices). My husband fought the idea of crating until he had found more than his limit of poop and pee on the floor - and he had read enough about crating to agree to give it a try. I ordered the crate after 2 1/2 weeks of puppy parenting, and it arrived a week later. Free shipping was wonderful. We have gradually increased her time in the crate - starting with short periods during the day then adding short periods at night. She is now crated all night and up to 5 hours at a time during the day. What a difference it has made in potty training (though still a ways to go). And she really seems to enjoy the down time in her ""den"". We ordered the crate that will accommodate her when she's reached her full size. She's not once peed or pooped in it. The crate is sturdy yet airy. We haven't yet needed to break it down, but my husband said it went up very easily. We're very happy with the quality - I gave this one only 4 stars because I know there are others out there that are built stronger - even though we don't need one of those for her.",dogs,3
"I, too, bought this to deal with an overweight cat, and weekends away from home. Unfortunately, the cat quickly figured out how to help himself to extra food by tapping the auger with his paw. No, he doesn't get much with each tap, but I can hear him messing with it all night long, so I know he is getting more food then his diet allows. So it sits empty and idle in the corner of the kitchen.......To it's credit, the device is sturdy and the timer's many programs makes it versatile.",cats,2
"For the past few years I have been on a quest to find a litter box that doesn't drive me totally bonkers. Well, for me, this is the one.At first I was apprehensive because I have four cats total, and two of them are afraid of their own shadows. I wasn't sure if all of them would take to this foreign contraption. Well, two of them could hardly wait until I finished pouring the litter to give it a try. And the other two weren't far behind. So that answered that question.As for me, I have far less to clean up, which is what I have been looking for. Sure a few grains get stuck in their paws and end up near the box. But I can't even begin to express what a profound improvement that is from other brand X cat boxes. I no longer have to worry about my vacuum blowing up from all the litter intake.I like that I can pour extra litter into the box to make the scooping less toilsome. And since my cats love to throw litter everywhere, the lid and high sides allow for that without permitting them to create their own beach out of my laundry room floor.Five stars! And I'm going to buy one of these for everyone I know who owns cats!",cats,2
"Received my kitten collar and placed it on my little princess who weighs 4 pounds. She didn't like it at first, but was unable to remove it. I love it because I can tell where my little one is playing because of the cute pink bell. This item was well worth the price and there is plenty of room for my princess to grow, since it is a stretch collar. I would definitely recommend this item!",cats,2
"A very good and strong product. My dog Bullet chews without mercy and usually destroys chew toys within minutes, but this one stood up to the test. It took Bullet 2 weeks before he actually bit through it and even then it still squeeked. I'm sorry I didnt purchase at least 2 more. Its a good product.",dogs,3
"This is good for what it is. Its a bit smaller than I thought it would be. I should have done more research. Its made nicely and the pup seems to like it ok.I think it will work for short trips. If you have a very small dog it will work just fine, any dog over five pounds will be uncomfortable, my opinion only.I will buy a larger one next timeThank YouBob and Char",dogs,3
Our Yellow lab usually can take care of a new toy in 1 hour or less. This is one of the VERY few toys we have found that she hasn't been able to destroy yet. She's had it about 2 months and it still looks like it did when it was new. Great that it holds dog biscuits too!,dogs,3
Excellent product. This is not an ordinary stuffed animal. Holds up really well in comparison. My dog loves these dolls.,dogs,3
"I was amazed to see some negative comments about littermate.My has been working fine for five years. No mechanical problems at all. The instructions say to empty the container once a week. My cat fills it in five days. So I schedule myself to empty it twice a week. Is it Monday or Thurs? Time to clean the litter box.It does take expensive litter, but you use less. I find that emptying all the litter and starting over needs to be done about one a month. I do check the box on a daily basis. That is easy for me as it not located in an out of the way place.Yes, it does make noise. But, that just tells me the cat has been there. I only change the container when I empty the box. Works find to simply empty it and replace. I use baby oil in the bottom to help keep it from sticking.One funny story is that the first time my cat heard it she ran out of the room. Now she puts her head over the top and watches the rake. It is quite humorous to watch.",cats,2
"I haven't tasted it, but Wellness Kitten was recommended by my kitten's rescue folks. She seems to like it, but not love it. It's very expensive in the brick-and-mortar stores, so I turned to Amazon for relief. The best price anywhere and delivered no-muss-no-fuss.",cats,2

"At the moment, this is the only bedding that I will use for my guinea pigs (particularly, the snow-white ""bleached"" variant that allows me to spot clean soiled areas, but the natural version as shown in the product image is great too). I've tried aspen shavings, and I also used wood shavings in the past when I had hamsters. Unfortunately, wood shavings stick to clothes and carpet, and are a huge pain to deal with in laundry and house cleaning. Not so with Carefresh wood pulp bedding - this bedding is clumpy, but not sticky, and very highly absorbent. Due to its ability to absorb and dry quickly and thoroughly, I never have an odor problem, yet there are no perfumes or hazardous chemicals in the bedding. Highly recommended.I knocked off a star (was tempted to rate this product a 5) for only two reasons:1) Carefresh also sells the same material bedding in different colors, and I don't think even relatively ""safe"" dyes belong in pet bedding. It's probably best to stick with the natural or bleached varieties.2) It can be very dusty, but this is an easily managed problem compared to issues with other kinds of bedding, and the dust is not harmful to the animals.",bunny rabbit central,1
"I work 12 hour shifts and my room mate works 9 hours, and together we have 3 cats. I've always tried to keep to a daily schedule of cleaning the box to keep our place fresh, but after a really long shift during the summer, coming home to a house with 3 cats and one litter box in 90-degree heat and 70% humidity was getting old fast. Then my room mate received this self cleaning litter box in the mail. I was skeptical but hopeful that it would work as easily as it said it would.Soon enough, the 3 monsters had given the new cat box plenty of material for its debut test run, and sure enough it worked exactly as the manufacturer claimed it would; I shook the cat box a little first, just to break up the litter, rolled it over in one quick motion, held it almost upside down, tapped the bottom a couple times with my free hand, and rolled it back. I pulled out the drawer and emptied it into a supermarket plastic shopping bag (which are the best because they're free!), and threw it in the trash. Easiest way to clean a litter box I can imagine; its simplicity is what makes it so great. Believe me, this product will not disappoint you, especially if you have multiple cats to clean up after.",cats,2
"I like this toy, It is soft and has enough movement that my cat is attracted to it. I would have given 5 stars if the length of the stick was longer. Have to lean a little too much when I play with my cat.",cats,2
"This works great! It's easy to refill it with more spray.My barky flatcoat retriever only took about two sprays before he learned not to bark while it's on. Unfortunately he also learned that once it comes off he can bark again. So I just put it on him a couple times a day - like feeding times - so I can keep him in his outdoor kennel for 20 minutes while waiting for his food to digest. That way the neighbors aren't disturbed by his ""let me out!"" barks.With any luck your dog won't figure out that it's the collar preventing him from barking, but mine did. The collar is too bulky to leave it on him all day long and I worry about his brother chewing it off of him. So for now it's just making more sense to take it off and put it on when needed.",dogs,3
Work very very well!! Make sure u noe how to trainin a dog using such device. Overall this is an awesome device and gave me NO PROBLEMS.,dogs,3
This crate is very sturdy and easy to assemble. The XLarge version does have ventilation on all 4 sides and easily worked as a travel crate with the airline. It and the dog flew from MD to WA and held up great. It is now her crate for home and there are no problems with it. Would recommend this brand.,cats,2
"I used this product exactly as the directions said. I found it to be very stinky, as you have to mix the granules with canned food.

It is in liver flavored pill form, and one dose is supposed to work.",dogs,3

I will have to keep looking.",cats,2

"I have two, long-haired cats who shed profusely most of the year. I hesitated because of the expense, but bought my first Furminator in the hope that if it did half of what the manufacturer claimed, it would be worth the price. An 80% reduction in shedding for these two cats would be miraculous! WOW! This product far exceeded my expectations, lived up to its name and drastically reduced the shedding.I bought this larger Furminator for my daughter - although her dog is a short haired, Golden Retriever his shedding was the same or worse than my cats. Needless to say, Furminator saved the day - and the constant need to vacuum, remove hair from the furniture, etc. The best part is that it's easy to use and the animals love it! I highly recommend this product.",cats,2
I have a 6 month old lab puppy who is way too smart for her own good. She is into everything and I swear suffers from ADD. I got this so I could have a few moments peace and it worked!

"You don't NEED this filter, per se, but it makes the fountain last much longer between cleaning, and it's just better for the animals (yeah, I know, cats and dogs lick themselves, and drink water from swamps, why do they need filtered water?!).

I read all the reviews on this and ordered it because of the low price. It started acting up and not working properly within 2 weeks. My cat loved the double feedings but that was not the point.

Now I have to return the Lentek.,cats,2
"This stuff actually works. I bought a couch on Craigslist recently and apparently the owner's dogs must have been living on it. It stunk up my entire apartment and I thought I would have to get rid of it. Two coats of this stuff completely took care of the problem though - the smell disappeared like magic. However, do not buy this on Amazon. When the package got here it was soaking wet. No one had even bothered to screw the lid on tightly and half the bottle had leaked out - terrible, terrible packaging. Definitely not up to Amazon's usual standards. So definitely buy this stuff, but buy it somewhere else.",dogs,3

I have had the Feliway diffuser plugged in for the last month and have not seen any change in the behavior or disposition in my cats. Vertical scratching and irrationally fearful behavior when new visitors arrive still persist. It has definitely not helped ""comfort"" the cats in the ways advertised. Of course I don't expect miracles but I expected to see some change. Now that 30 days have gone by I am reluctant to spend another $20 to refill the diffuser. Maybe a Glade plugin will work just as well!",cats,2

"I normally feed my three goldfish pellets or flakes, the most commonly available food in my town without a pet food store. I purchased the Tetra crisps on a whim, but I've found that this product works great and my fish love it, too. Not that they're picky or anything. The product prides itself on leading to a cleaner tank and less mess. It's right on one point - there really is less mess in pouring these in and feeding them, and unlike the flakes, I don't find them in my filter later or coating the sides of the tank. The tank, though, is still as dirty as ever, but I can't really complain about this product. The fish love it, the bottle makes feeding easy, and I don't have to pick out leftovers. I'd definitely recommend this product to goldfish owners, but don't expect it to really do much in the cleaner water department.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I live in an apartment complex and the neighorhood strays seem to think that my patio is their personal litter box. I set this up for over a week. At first, it seemed to be working because I wasn't finding any evidence that the cats had been around, but we had lots of rain that week. Then there it was...a nice little present right in the path of the Catstop. Remaining hopeful, I moved the Catstop to be in direct line with the area they frequented the most. The next day right in front of the Catstop was another ""package"". I know the unit was working because when I would walk by it, I set it off. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to scare the cats away as claimed.I really had hoped it worked as other reviewers seem to have had good results. But for me, it was an expensive failure.",cats,2

"With two golden retrievers who like to go swimming in lakes and ponds, I consistently have problems with chronic ear infections. I have spent a lot of money on other ear washes on the market that seem to work only if my dogs do not currently have an ear infection. If my dogs do have an ear infection, they only seem to irritate or not solve the problem, and I resort to putting medicated ear drops in my dogs ears for weeks at a time. Enter Vet's Best. I bought the Ear Wash and Dry off of Amazon based on the solid reviews and fairly inexpensive price tag. I honestly did not think that something holistic and inexpensive would work on my dogs. I figured that I was just a sucker for cool packaging, yet again. I was really wrong. This stuff ROCKS. It actually clears up ear infections, and it does so in a way that doesn't burn or further irritate my dogs' ears (other stuff that I have used with alcohol or bleach in it would make my dogs cry out in pain if they had open sores in their ears). I really like both the wash and dry together. Because my dogs' ears flop, I'm always worried that they do not get adequately dry, thus helping to further along any bacterial infection. The drying agent (which really does dry to a powder because I tried it out on my hand first) is great - just squirt and rub after using the wash - no need to clean out further with a cotton ball. The only downside for me is the smell. I know that a lot of people like the smell of cloves, but I'm just not a huge fan, and it seems to stink up my hands (if not using rubber gloves) for quite a while afterwards, despite washing. However, I will more than gladly put up with the smell because the solutions really, really work for my pets. Plus, I feel good that the wash and dry are made out of natural ingredients. I love this stuff!",cats,2

"I have two bengal kittens (12 weeks). They enjoy their Peek-a-Prize, they ""got it"" pretty quickly and very eagerly scrambled to pull toys out of the box. The box is surprisingly well made (although I did find a nail sticking out, and had to deal with that, so be sure to carefully inspect it before giving it to your cats!). The main problem I have with it, is that it is too trivial for the kittens to get their toys out of it. They reach inside, hit it with a paw, and it rolls right out. Fun, but not the sort of lasting fun I was hoping for.Still, I think this is how I will introduce their ""toys of the day"" to them (by putting them in this box). Makes it just a little more fun.",cats,2
"This pet crate has an odd name considering its complete lack of interface with any Apple product I have ever encountered.I bought this cage to transport my dog (of unknown parentage; 30&#34; long x 18&#34; tall) in the trunk of my medium-size SUV. The crate takes up a lot of cargo space, and has ample room for my dog. Midwest's next smaller crate would likely have been adequate, but I'd rather Alfie traveled First rather than Economy if you get what I mean.Assembly is simple, the side and roof sections fold out and up, and are secured by clips. The floor is a sturdy plastic pan, and two doors gives me options as to how I orientate the cage in my car. Dis-assembly is likewise simple and makes storage easy.The doors rattle quite a lot - may not bother some but it does me, so I have to wedge them to keep it quiet. That's really my only (minor) gripe, otherwise I have no problem recommending this product.",dogs,3

"These litter box liners have worked great for me!I have 6 cats with claws & they have never torn the liners, but I do keep about 4"" of litter in my litter boxes, as a couple of my cats really like to dig deep. If the litter was not deep, they probably would tear the liners with their claws.The larger size is great, allowing me to tie it closed after sifting. I just tuck the extra under the box. I have 2 litter boxes & sift them every other day & have no litter box odor at all in my small home, but that may not be the case if you do not use a premium scoopable clumping cat litter.I also highly recommend Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Premium Scoopable Multi-Cat Cat Litter, which I buy in 40lb bags.Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bag. Available here online, sometimes on sale for $16 with free shipping, or at Getco or Getsmart for about the same price.I have owned cats for over 40 years & with 6 indoor only cats now, BELIEVE ME, I have tried my share of cat litter, always searching for the perfect one. This one is excellent!! It has great odor control, is hard clumping, dust free (some kitty litters are so nasty with dust you need to wear a mask when pouring them), does not have a fragrance or perfume odor & is the very best cat litter I have ever used!!

He puffs up his feather and and spreads his wings to help the water get to his downy feathers and his skin. He also uses the sandy texture on the perch to groom his beak. It is sturdy and I have no fear that the perch will fall while my bird is on it, at least with my cockatiel.I wouldn't recommend it for people with only textured tile in their showers. The suction cups do not stick to that well, but smooth shower surfaces work great",birds,0

I just leave the leash attatched to the front and unclip the black portion of the harness so it slides right off..plus it's just as easy to put back on. Worth every penny.",dogs,3

"So, I've had two litter maid Elites in my year of cat ownership. I wish I'd known about this product earlier.It's incredibly well made in comparison, the design doesn't rely on having *exactly* the right amount of litter to work, and it takes up a lot less space. It also seems cleaner and more hygienic than the ""open pan"" style of the Litter Maid, whilst being quieter and much more efficient.My cats preferred the open pan until it was taken away, but now (all being well!) are seemingly happy with the Litter Robot....",cats,2

It seemed to only lift right behind the front legs, and we need help with his back hips, getting up stairs, in/out of car etc. After looking at the photos above, it looks that way there, too, so maybe it's not the size, after all.

While I did see some hair come out while using the FURminator, it didn't seem to be that much more than the slicker brush I ussually use on my dog, let alone the MOUNDS of fur that I was expecting to pull out.Don't fall for the hype around this one -- it's not worth the price tag.",cats,2

"My parents used this product on their cat and she got sick and died shortly afterward. The cat stopped eating and became lethargic right after receiving the medication and rapidly deteriorated. The vet couldn't tell what was wrong with her but assumed it was old age, since she was 16 years old.
