"I originally wrote a scathing review for this filter because it was so incredibly loud I couldn't even sleep with it on but after tinkering with it several times I seem to have found the problem. It is difficult to explain without being able to show the specific part, but if you buy this filter it may come partially assembled like mine did. With mine the impeller was snugly inserted into the tube part I realized if I yanked the impeller free and instead pressed it snugly, magnet down, into the base portion it completely eliminated the wobble and noise making problem. All is well!! If filtration turns out to be crappy I will update my review.Jan 23 Update"
"In less than 4 weeks, the light sockets literally fell out. No physical cause, just extremely poor workmanship. Definitely a hood to avoid."
This leash worked out great the padding in the handle is super comfortable and the clasps are heavy duty. It has no problems with two german shepherds and the adjustableness is super easy to work out
"I bought the 8 oz version awhile back. I know the size because I measured it and it holds 8 oz of water. It's a great bowl, but I needed a bigger one, so I ordered the 12 oz version. But the one I got is the same size as the 8 oz. Someone needs to get their act together."
"I use to have to leave a faucet in our bathroom running other wise my cat would not drink any water. I had purchased this product to end that. I have to say that she is drinking more water then ever and she looks more hydrated, I do not think she was getting enough water before. The fountain is very quiet, you never hear it running. You do not even hear the water that is pouring out it, it is so quiet. Very easy to maintain and built very well. Thank you so much for such a wonderful product."
My little dog loves treats. Always expect one in the mornings. This is a good treat for him and he seems to really enjoy them so I have to assume they are good.
"I saw reviews on this and figured i would try it out. My dog needed a new bowl and the whole stand itself was perfect. She can eat without discomfort and she can bury her head in there how she likes lol. Great product, definitely recommend getting one. (Female chocolate Labrador, 70 pounds)"
"I can't believe all the glowing reviews for this product. It's creepy. Clouds of dust drift upwards whenever you gently run the scoop through it. The dust then settles on every surface of the room. Not to mention your hands...well ok, let's mention them. I scrub my hands after using this stuff and I swear the sickly sweet perfume odor cannot be washed off! My hands stink of grandmother perfume for an hour afterwards as though I had been building sand castles on a cat litter beach. And this is just from touching the scoop and being in the vicinity of the ominous dust cloud. Yikes. At least when strangers visit they don't immediately comment on your owning a cat. No, instead it's ""Oh does your grandmother live with you? And what's up with all the white powder? I thought people quit that stuff back in the '80s."""
"10-30% (or 50%, as all un-official sources differ) of cats have no response to N. cataria. My cat is one of these cats, with the sole response being to immediately ingest any visible catnip, most likely being that it's green and looks edible.Despite this, my cat seems to have a high affinity for the toy. Whether it's the realistic look or simply all the fur, my cat has been hunting this toy exclusively. The toy is very well made, and seems to hold up to constant abuse involving nails and teeth. It's worth the price, even without the catnip."
This is the best bubbler. It holds a TON of water and the bowl is nice and big. I bought a different one after I broke the T tubing on the old one. It was a TOTAL waste of money. I will be ordering another one of these. I wish there was a way to order the T tubing but it's worth it because it's a great bubbler.
My catsn seemed to really like this catnip filled toy. I think that they especially like it because it is so large and they can wrap around it.
Grass is a little anemic without natural light. But it grows and the cats eat it. Cheaper than buying pots of grass at the grocery store.
"My 50# German sheppard loves this toy, but... the squeaker only last 5 minutes - I am pretty sure he ate it. The rest last for another month or so. I refuse to buy it again because I am afraid he will eat the squeaker again."
"While I have been on the whole more than satisfied with this thermometer, knowing that most of its imperfections are shared with all liquid crystal thermometers, there is one problem - if you stick it on and don't like where you put it, be prepared to buy a new one. I'm already on my second because the stubborn thing just wouldn't come off and started to rip."
I have 3 cats and they really love this toy. It sounds like a bird fly and it gets their attention and they go after it.
"I've been brushing my dogs teeth for the last 9 years (her whole life), every single day. I've used natural, artificial, and vet recommended toothpastes. The bottom line is, this toothpaste above all, truly does what it claims to do. The problem with all the other toothpastes that I've used for my dog (and I've tried every kind at PetsMart and those given to me by the Vet (I think it was CET)), is that they only prevent at a mild pace the build up of tartar and other nasty stuff on the teeth, and that's only if you brush every day pretty vigorously. As my vet put it, dog toothpastes are meant to slow down the build up of tartar and cosmetic problems like yellow teeth, not prevent or reverse it (that's why they recommend their own very expensive, under anesthesia, teeth cleaning).I noticed that whenever I switched away from Petrodex Enzymatic Toothpaste to another one (especially the natural ones), within just a month, my dog's teeth would become markedly yellowed and tartar would begin to build. I'd panic, and switch back to Petrodex. Again, within a month, they'd be as white as a 1 year olds teeth (clearly reversing previous buildup). I've run through this cycle of changing pastes from Petrodex to another and back again at least 5 times for various reasons. An every time, it's no accident that my dog's teeth are cleaner when I use this toothpaste. I can't say exactly why, but I can tell you what I see.I also recommend you use the standard double ended pet toothbrush that's sold in a bundle with this toothpaste (Petrodex Dental Kit For Dogs), NOT the three headed toothbrush (The Better Pet Toothbrush and Toothpaste; see my review there for an explanation).Overall though, if you're not going to be brushing your dogs teeth every day (minus a day here or there), don't expect miracles even with this toothpaste. Imagine if you brushed your teeth every now and then!Also, make sure to massage the gums with the brush, especially around the area where they meet the teeth, as this will help solidify the area, and minimize any cracks where bacteria can seep through and cause gingivitis and even heart disease! If you notice that the toothbrush is pink after you've brushed your dog's teeth, that means that their gums are still weak and will require some gentle massaging until the pink subsides.Have fun!"
"I bought this about a month ago and have been using it most of the time since, without any unusual problems. However, like many people have mentioned, the feeder has two problems:1. Programming it is a bit hard to figure out, since the included instructions don't seem to be complete. The instructions were enough to get me started and I was able to figure it out in a few minutes though. I can see how people might get frustrated and think the feeder was defective.2. My 15 lb. cat quickly discovered (the first day!) how to put her paw up the food chute and get an extra kibble or two. I put a piece of wood over the opening to fix that and ended up building a simple wooden enclosure to prevent her from moving the feeder around or knocking it over. I suppose that larger, more persistent pets could do more damage, but the unit seems fairly sturdy.Because of the second flaw, I'd be tempted to return it and rate it two stars. However, the unit works well otherwise and I didn't see any better feeders out there. I programmed the feeder to dispense 1/4 cup of food twice a day and it has worked reliably. It holds a lot of food (for a cat), so I'm not filling it up all the time. The feeder doesn't seem to be air tight, so I don't put a lot of food in it because it may get stale.I bought the feeder to feed my cat while I'm out of town or working late and have ended up using it to feed her all the time. Now, she doesn't beg me for food like she used to, which is a nice bonus. I can sleep late or work late and not worry about feeding her. So, I added an extra star for that.Overall, the feeder works with two potentially serious problems, that you should consider before purchase. I'd buy it again myself, but hope that Petmate will improve the manual and feeder chute. They could make some minor changes to make this a good product.--Update - added a star, because it's still working fine after four years. Battery life has been good. Programming is still a bit cumbersome, but works. I wrote a cheat sheet to help program it when changing batteries."
"I have 3 beautiful kitties. Two of whom wear these all the time. The last was declawed by a previous owner. Living with both clawed and declawed cats, you can really see the difference in terms of how they walk (yes it does change their gait) and their resulting physical activity and playfulness (or lack thereof). I thoroughly believe in this product. It is far more humane than declawing and has served my house very well.Do the girls ""love"" the soft claws? No. But they're used to them by now. When some fall off, they put up a bit of a fuss having the replacements put on. But a few minutes later, they're back to running, jumping, and playing around the house. I also recommend the colored varieties so you can see more easily when any have fallen off.The only thing I'd caution is eventually your cat won't even try to chew their claws. Like I said, they get used to the claw caps. At that point you want to check your cat every month at minimum for nail growth with caps that have not fallen off. The claws keep growing even with the cap on, and you don't want it to curl back around into the paw pad. If the cap doesn't fall off, it needs to be clipped back."
"I've had this collar for about a month. I had high hopes for it when I snapped it on my Great Dane/Lab mix and he stopped barking right away. It didn't last. He figured out quickly that the collar was spraying him, and he continued to bark like a lunatic when it wasn't on. After a few days I could visibly see that he was getting sprayed even when he wasn't barking. Not fair. Then he figured out that once the spray ran out, it didn't work at all. I would put it on him, he would be quiet and suffer through it until the spray ran out, then he would bark his head off again. So...in a nutshell, it's effective only IF I have just filled it, and only IF it is actually on him (meaning I will be buying refills for the rest of his life with this product). Also; The clasp on the collar is cheaply made and difficult to get on and off, you could replace the nylon collar with something better made if you wanted to put in the extra effort, or spend the extra money to buy something that really works."
My cat would only drink out of the sink faucet. I am thrilled that she likes the Drinkwell Fountain. I am free of being a slave to watering the cat!
"Please note that my review is for very small ""toy"" dogs under 10lbs.These pads costs a small fraction of what I had been paying for my regular training pads. They are much thinner than my regular pads. Even the box is a fraction the size of my regular pads. I'm sure my regular pads would hold more, but I've learned that I don't need that much protection for my small dog who can use these pads several times during the day with no overflow.These pads fit my standard size pad holders. They hold up to repeated use during the day by my 6lb Maltese. I've been using them for almost a year now w/o any problems. I will continue to use this product.Advantages:Cost a fraction of what my usual pads cost.Box takes up a fraction of the storage space of my usual pads.Pads fit standard size pad tray.For a small dog (under 10 lb) they work fine, absorbing multiple uses during the day w/o leaking.Disadvantages:I really haven't found any when used for my 6 pound Maltese.They may not be sufficiently absorbent for use with very large dogs.For 'toy' size dogs (under 10 lbs) I would recommend you give these a try."
"i'm sorry to say that neither of my two cats have given this product more than a cursory once over since we got it around 10 days ago, nevemind use it for its intended purpose. they are both horizontal scratchers. basically, if its on the floor, its fair game. but not this thing! i tried placing it in their favorate scratching places, rubbed it with regular catnip + even tried Catit Liquid Catnip (see my review for that!) once, my older cat laid down on it + fell asleep like it was a floor level window sill but no action whatsoever since that thrilling performance. what a waste of money!"
I bought one of these and a Tux to see if a) my boys would like them and b) they'd hold up to my furry weapons of mass destruction. The answer to both is yes. They really seem to like both toys although they have a definite preference for this one (they're wrestling over it behind me as I type) and not a tooth mark on either one so far after a few weeks of heavy play. I've had to toss out a ridiculous number of toys in the last year because of damage (Kong toys included) so to find something that holds up ... that they actually like playing with ... yay!
"Great product. The crate arrived earlier than expected for which I was grateful. It was very easy to assemble - no tools required! I had an old crate that I used when I first got my dog and it was one of the ""hard sided"" kind which did not allow for air flow. This Midwest crate is terrific. My dog can see everything going on and gets plenty of ""fan breeze"" from the room. It has 2 doors which will be useful when we travel and have to set up in a hotel room or at relatives. For a folding crate it is very sturdy. The only drawback I can think of is if you have an escape artist dog, he could probably figure out how to open the latch which just slides horizontally into place. My dog sleeps here each night and has never tried to get out. She's much happier with this model."
fish love it. my smaller fish have an easier time eating this food as it softens up quickly and my bigger fish seem to like it better than pelets.
"I was so hopeful that this product would work, the on-line information even mentioned that you can train your dog or your neighbor's dog. After receiving the priduct I read the instructions carefully and saw that it is for indoor use only which will not help curb my neighbor's dog's barking. Since our weather is good I hung it on the fence facing the dog and turned it on. I could tell that it irriated her. Her barks changed to yips but after only a few hours she had learned how far she had to go to get out of range of it. The dog is still barking but now we are dealing with the owners and a no bark collar has shown an improvement."
"I've had mine for about 7 years and I (and my Papillon) love it! He can't ride on the sit but he is happy if he's riding while looking at the window. Easy to install, easy to remove and back and forth. I even use it on the back sit of my two door car."
I was sceptical about this product considering all the research I did saidthat the dark stains were genetic or from allergies and could not be corrected.This product really works. I am thrilled with the results. Our dog is aMaltese and she is so pretty without the dark stains under her eyes!
"i really like this gate, works well to keep my 2 german shepherds in the back of my toyota rav 4. Took a couple of adjustments with a phillips head screwdriver but i have had it for 3 months and it is still going strong."
"I have 3 very large plecos, and was surprised as to the cost of algae discs in the retail stores. I found this on Amazon (I do 90% of my shopping on Amazon) and not only do my fish love these discs, it is about 1/2 the price of that in the stores. I also registered for automatic shipping of the product on a monthly basis."
"If you enjoy handling your cat's waste products even more than you did with a conventional box, this is the product for you.Also, you'll want to put a big tray underneath since all sorts of things will get dumped on the floor as the rake mechanism moves up towards the bin. Why in the world do the sides drop away at the bin end?You'll want to check the box every day & rake the litter by hand, and empty the bin every other day or so.Good concept, poor design."
"This item took longer than expected to arrive, and when it finally did i was extremely disappointed in the contents. the wire cage and base itself are fine. The wheel and ladder are not as they appear in the picture. The house was broken and covered in some kind of black film that i can't scrub off. There are no directions only pictures! The wheel seems to have pretty sharp edges and so does the house. I'm going to request replacement parts and hope for the best i suppose. Overall i thought this was a deal for the cost, but it turns out its worth exactly what you pay, which is not much."
"I had previously purchased a similar ""knock off"" version of the coolaroo dog bed. I should have just purchased this bed initially and not wasted my money on what turned out to be a much more expensive/ much lower quality product.I bought two coolaroos for my Labrador Retriever and my Lab/Doberman mix. Each dog weighs in excess of 60 lbs. If they want, they can fit on one bed together comfortably. We use the beds indoors. They have not loosened up, frayed, sagged or been damaged in any way by the dogs' nails. The beds I purchased previously were shredded within a few weeks by my dogs' nails from ""digging"" when they curled up to lie down.The best part about these dog cots is they don't retain any doggie smell like traditional dog beds."
"Very cute but also small. My cats are all 10+lbs and they can't fit. My 4lb rabbit loves it thou. So if you have a small cat or kitten (or a rabbit) this would be great. If you have a larger cat, don't bother."
"I have two of these for my elderly, arthritic cats. They can now enjoy the sun on two beds that they were unable to jump onto. Stores easily although they are always set up at my house. I love them and so do the cats."
"I bought this harness for my little piggie and he is pretty big. When i recieved this harness i thought it wouldn't fit him but as i put it on him he quickly riggled out of it. i tried to train him by keeping it on him for a little bit but he would bite at it and riggle out. Do NOT buy this item, a big waste of my money."
It is winter in Louisiana and we like the two houses we boughtAnd so do our four dogs. If they are cool enough in the summerWe will buy two more
Works the best of all we've tried through the years and very easy to clean! God 'ole trusty Arm & Hammer!
"We have two shelties and before I found this fur rake we'd spend hours in the spring and fall cleaning up their undercoat when they began shedding. This tool works great. It gets out the undercoat without pulling the top coat fur and it is fast, easy, and doesn't hurt. Snags and mats can be gently worked out."
"This is the same food I was paying much more for at our local veterinarian. Cat's love it, which is the proof in the pudding!"
"I am very happy with this car/bed/seat. My little guy is 10 pounds and settled right in. He especially loves the fleecy lining. I bought the medium size to ensure he would have enough room to lie down and stretch out, plus there's enough room for two small dishes and chewy toys.The reason I bought it was for safety--especially the driver. I think it is too dangerous to have a dog moving around the interior. Two times when I stopped short, he flew from the backseat, between the front seats, and ended up smashing into the gearshift and console. I didn't want to spend so much for a doggie carseat (more than a baby's!), but the second time that happened, I ordered it right away and didn't take him in the car until it arrived. I ordered on a Tues. and it was delivered on Friday--with free shipping. The Amazon price is the best, but the only colour offered is black. Peluche is a white toy poodle so the black is what I wanted, anyway.Peluche + Snoozer carseat = traveling perfection!"
my golden retreiver puppy couldnt care less about this dumb thing. even followed all directions and it does not work
"I have a mini-Schnoodle and a mini-labradoodle (15 lb each); they fit comfortably into the LARGE Outlook Pet Car Seat. This fleece-lined ultra comfy car seat puts my pups up high enough to supervise the world as we drive by, and close enough for me to reach back and interact with them, all while keeping them safely harnessed in. They both have room enough to curl up for a nap too.I secure the pet car seat with a seatbelt across 2 seats. I decided to anchor tethers (6' dollar store leashes adjusted for each dog) from the trunk area up under the head rests for one car (threaded through the seat crack on my other car) instead of using the ones that go onto the seatbelt. I leave the tethers in the cars and can easily swap the seat between our cars as desired.The handy hidden drawer is large enough for small food/water dishes, a brush, kibble, treats, and clean-up bags. We're ready to hit the road for adventure! The cover is machine washable, so it always looks nice. I bought mine in Highland Maize, and the quiet blue-gray plaid is attractive with my upholstery. Happy dogs! Happy owner!"
"This product is fantastic and an answer to a persistent problem in our multiple cat and dog household -- how to keep the dogs out of the cat food and litter boxes. I've spent untold years hopping (AND FALLING) over child gates with holes cut in one side to allow the cats easy access. We had looked at walk-through gates in the past, but 1) they didn't have a door for the cats and 2) they needed to be permanently mounted to the door frame. This gate solved ALL our issues. It has the cat door, has a walk-through door that functions easily, is of sturdy metal construction, and miraculously, sets up with tension so it can be moved if necessary.An added bonus -- it was significantly cheaper through Amazon than the local pet super store!"
"This is great cat litter, my favorite so far. I thought it was quite expensive. but it is great stuff."
This carrier is ok but can't compare in quality to the one I bought 8 years ago.
"This is my second Hydor 320. I bought one for a 29 gallon aquarium I have and it was doing really well so I bought the same one when I got a 75 gal cichlid tank set up. Easy to clean, quiet...no problems at all."
"Do not buy this product. The suction cups dont stay stuck to the aquarium and could kill your turtle. I know this because it killed mine. The suction cups came loose while i was out and when i came back, my turtle was stuck between the basking area and the tank glass. Poor thing suffocated. :( i should of bought the Landing pad..."
"I've only used this a couple of times so I can't comment on how effective it is. Since others have covered that, my comments concern the container. It is very difficult to get the product out of the bottle without ending up with too much or too little product.A different type of container for something this thick is strongly needed.If you want to use it, get the spray and not the gel, so you won't have this issue.Update"
"In her review of Frosty Dog, Chantal Ritz says that she doesn't think that any dog toy is ""truly 'indestructable.'"" I agree. There's not a dog toy made that can withstand the chewing of a particularly determined mutt. So the only really fair tests for a dog toy are whether your dog likes it; whether it's safe; and whether it holds up reasonably well when subjected to day-to-day gnawing? With those tests in mind, the ""Dynamic Duo,"" (a male Westie and female Scotty) give Frosty Dog four stars. They are currently trying to dismember their second. The first one lasted a year, the last six months of which were spent with two legs and no nose. And they would still be playing with it, except that I got tired of looking at the poor bedraggled thing. By the way, I think that the ""large"" FD is probably the right size for all, but the very smallest, dogs. The Dynamic Duo only weigh in at 20 pounds each, but the ""large"" FD suits them fine."
"The first one I ordered leaked everywhere and the company sent me a new one free of hassle. The second one worked, but it's nearly impossible to get the motor out of it to clean it. I have long thin fingers, and not even I could get the thing. The fountain cracked in my attempt. It is now completely useless. Otherwise it worked well, which is why I gave this product two stars instead of one. Definitely not buying this fountain again. My cat needs a fountain to drink out of for his bladder health, I don't have money to get a new one, so now my cat will suffer because a company can't put out a decent product. Do not buy this product. It is not worth the frustration."
"This is a great toy for a puppy, it is in great shape and was sent promptly."
My 7 month old Rottweiler broke the bottom lid off within a few minutes. The plastic is hard and when he tossed the product around by the rope it hit the ground and broke. Now he just plays with the rope.
"I had an older LitterMaid and I loved it but after 5 years it died. This one hasn't lasted 6 months and even before that, I found myself cleaning it out just about every evening since it never did work very well."
"Have a 95 lb cane corso pit, lease works perfect. I like the classic(has wider web) large with optional bag."
have these in my local pet store for a bit more cost so was pleased to find this one for my son's dog who had outgrown the smaller size.
"Frontline Plus Dog 45-88 Pounds, 6 MonthFrontline Plus is very effective on fleas and ticks when used once a month. I have been using the product for many years and will continue to use it."
"My cats did not use this toy. I don't quite understand the theory behind it, and my cats apparently don't understand it either. The arm rotates around slowly and the balls just kind of roll around inside their ""cheese holes"".The balls don't pop up high enough for the cats to attempt to ""catch"" them. I found it a big waste of money and I wish I had sent it back for a refund. Instead it eventually found its way to the recycling bin. My cats enjoyed the Undercover Mouse much better."
"Turbo scratcher is the best! There must be something about the circle shape, my cat just loves it. She enjoys sitting on it when not scratching it, its like her own little island on the floor."
"My cat isn't the biggest chewer, but he does like to gnaw on my fingers sometimes. I just hold one of these out to him and he will happily sit and gnaw on it instead and he gets excited when a piece falls off. My other cat doesn't chew and isn't interested, but the treats do a great job for the one who does like them."
"I could't use this item because it turns out the product was not made for outdoor use, where it might be exposed to rain. It seemed to work well when I first tried it out."
"The best kitty litter, i like no smell at all. u dong need to change it once in a while. i use some baking soda fir kitty litters and it does the job well. got it fast too! Maybe because I live in nj. Like next day literary"
"cute but 2 cats,chihuahua,a pit bull all ran from it.Never interested again.I works like it says and lasts long but we cannot for the life of us understand why the animals are all scared of it .I thought the cats would even hit it a few times. no they wanted nothing to do with it.I talk to my pets all the time so this could just be another voice to them and also it maybe alot of company to someone not home with pets .Me i am here due to health 24/7"
"We really like this pad holder a lot. Our 14 week Mini Dachshund no longer pulls the pads all over the house and with a few exceptions, she does her business on this every time. My only real complaint is that I wish the rim was a little wider and more of it was sloped toward the pad. Our little girl does a great job of getting all the way on the pad, but sometimes she squats toward the outside and some of the pee goes on the floor. We give her credit for trying, but if the rim was a bit wider I think most or all the pee would just run back down to the pad. Overall though, this works great! Now if I could just figure out how to keep her from trying to run off with the new pad when I'm in the process of changing it...lol!"
So much better than the one it replaced. Plenty of tension to prevent the leash from getting tangled up and the line guide at the front of the housing works 10X better than my old leash. I am extremely satisfied.
"We have a pomeranian and needed her to stop barking as we live in an apartment complex. We spent $100 on the initial collar. At first, it worked really well. She knew that if she barked she would get sprayed. But ... after a while it stopped working so effectively. It now only goes off about 1/4 barks. We have had to replace the battery many times as it apparently wears out quickly even if you are not using it and the citronella cans aren't cheap either. Also, our dog figured out that if she barks enough, the collar will empty and stop doing it because the citronella collar doesn't hold that much. Over all, if you have the money and REALLY need your dog to stop barking it works. But for us, it's really just too expensive (to purchase and maintain)."
I am actually using it on my hairless guinea pigs and it is amazing! I will definitely buy again! shipped fast and was a great bargin!
"I sent this to my stepdaughter, who has an indoor-only cat. She says her cat loves this! Shipping took awhile, but the Funhouse is great!"
"Bought it, dumped it. Maybe it works on other cats, not on my little psychos. I bought it to make the task of serving their medicine easier. They saw the gun and they went WOOOOOHAaaW."
"My family recently adopted a 15 lb. Chihuahua mix who was found abandoned... we didn't know what she had eaten beforehand, but I'm guessing it wasn't anything high-quality due to the condition of her teeth and coat. My goal was to get her on a high-quality diet (a ""6/6"" rating), and researched high protein/grain free diets and the benefits of them. Additionally, I read up on Innova/Evo and understood that their products are extremely high quality, and someone else on a forum recommended we try the Red Meat Small Bite kibble with her.Even at first sniff, my dog indicated she didn't like it. Of course, I figure it would take some time, so I worked on transitioning her off of the other kibble she was on. It basically came down to the fact that she would only eat the Innova Evo when it was mixed in with some wet food, and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in.Shortly after being on this high-protein diet (we didn't even finish her small bag of food), she began to urinate around the house, which she hasn't done in the 5 months we've had her. It turns out she had urinary crystals, which the vet attributed to the high protein levels of her diet. We had to put her on Flagil, and the vet recommended I put her on Hill's Science Diet c/d (which I know is full of corn and grain fillers). After politely declining, I changed her diet to something more holistic that DOES have grain (a ""4/6"" rating). She's fine now...Innova/Evo is an extremely high quality brand... perhaps it's better for larger and very active dogs. I know not ALL dogs may have this reaction to a high-protein diet, but I really think people need to understand that high-protein/no grain isn't always the smartest choice in terms of your dog's health. In our case, it turned out to be much more costly for us and more stressful for our dog to make this switch."
"I bought this in the store for almost $90 and was relieved when it actually WORKED!! Our dog is a barker! He barks at people, at dogs...and sometimes at his own shadow! This collar was a life saver for us all! He's quiet when the collar is on and we can all rest a little easier because of that. My only regret is that I didn't check Amazon first! At $31.00 it's a steal!"
"This is my second leash of this model; my first one wore out after 7 years (inner spring failed). My sole complaint about this model is that it is a bit too small to fit my hand in comfortably all the time, and I have small hands. In the winter, I can only get a couple of fingers through when wearing any gloves.Nevertheless, for walking my 16-lb. Peke at the same time as my 60-lb. Chow Chow, it's ideal. It gives room for each dog to keep its own pace, but doesn't let my Peke get so far away that I can't rein him in when he gets too feisty with other dogs. The tape is far less likely to burn skin (cord Flexis have scarred me more than once, and more often they belong to others!) and if the mechanism on the last one failed after 7 years of 3-4 walks/day, then I'd say it held up well."
"I also purchased these for my cats, and they did start to break. As soon as I saw my cats start to put the pieces in their mouths, I threw them all away. My vet bills are high enough (I run a shelter for special needs cats). If you can't watch your cats while they play with these, DO NOT buy them."
"Midwest 1530 icrate 30/19/21:Midwest crate construction, delivery, design all great. My Yorkshire loves it as size is optimum with plenty of room."
"I bought this for my Buick Rondevous and it did not fit. It was about 4"" short. I bought it from a local store and it said for vans, suvs, and trucks and figured it would fit my midsize SUV. The sizing on the box said it would be to small so my fault. I did measure how tall it gets on the box and the max size would not be very strong at all. If you are close to the max high I would say try something else. If you are well within the range I would say it looks like it would work well. Sizing is a little off."
This pad is great for crates. I have washed it once and so far it hasn't frayed or come apart yet. I've only had it for a few months so I will need to see how long it lasts. The pad is soft and the dogs seem to enjoy it.
While this is a good product...check the shipping cost. I didn't look closely enough...and found the shipping cost me more than the product. In those terms...it DEFINITELY was NOT WORTH IT!
Awesome!! Rock on! product got here fast!!Cats love the product. Thanks!!Awesome!! Rock on! product got here fast!! Cats love the product. Thanks!!
I did not think this Kong toy was as strong as most Kong toys. The material on the outside is not good for dogs. My dog swallowed some of it and had a little trouble going potty. I have a 90 pound Pit and Kong toys are still the best I just won't buy any with that fabric covering anymore.
I purchased this pen for my Guinea pig and he loves it. It is just the right size for my kitchen and it is perfect for my pet. It also keeps my two dogs away from the piggy also.
"This stuff is FANTASTIC! I have a little Yorkie with medium length hair - and I have tried half of the Shampoo's/Condtioner's on the market and this Cloud Star Buddy Rinse works the best BY FAR! It leaves the hair SUPER soft, SUPER silky, and VERY managable! Trust me, I've tried a TON - and the rest are just sitting under the cabinet not even being used. Buddy Rinse is THE BEST (yeah, and you GOTTA get the shampoo too!) We give it two PAWS up! ;)"
"My cat purch was so easy to put up. It is strong and is now the only place Pumkin (my kitty) likes to sleep. He looks so comfortible.I couldn,t find a better gift for him even at triple the cost."
"I first learned of this product from a Vet Tech while I was working in the ""cat house"" of an emergency rescue facility during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It really impressed me then when it calmed some of the more stressed out cats at our facility right down. They also used it with dogs before transporting them out of the area. I myself have used this with my own two cats during a four day trip to move across the country. It calms them down by making them sleepy, so I wouldn't plan on using it every day. Its always been very effective with my cats. I would start out with no more than one half of a tablet for cats.I have not seen a cat that would not eat it plain (one of my cats LOVES the taste) or would eat it ground up and put in their cat food. You might try it in plain chicken baby food, if your cat won't eat it any other way."
"I have an outside kitty who adopted us. We can't let her in the house because she doesn't get along with the other animals but I worry about her in the winter. She has a wonderful ""kitty house"" but it's not warm enough for the cold Ohio winter nights. I put this heated outdoor bed in her house and she loves it! Sometimes she doesn't even want to come out to eat dinner because she's so comfy. It's nice that I don't have to worry about her getting too cold anymore. I would highly recommend this bed to anyone with pets as it is cushioned and warm."
"These pet pads are the best! They are high quality, absorbant, and just the right size for my dog. The price can't be beat either. The shipping is super fast as well! 5 stars!"
The snap hooks are VERY weak. The hook on one end broke on day two and the hook on the other end broke on day four. Both hooks failed at the swivel. The cable seems to be of excellent quality and should provide good service with the replacement hooks.
"I originally bought the potty patch with the grass in the black tray. Even though my puppy used it he would also like to drag the grass around the floor which would also smear urine all over my floor and it is also a pain to clean. Not to mention he would also tear the grass pieces out and make a huge mess with it. I tried using disposable pads, but he would shred them into tiny pieces and would majorly end up missing them when he pees even if he hadn't obliterated it so I would end up with a huge mess anyways. I finally discovered these pads. They are very sturdy even if my puppy decides to throw a fit and attack them. If he decides to drag them on the floor they don't track urine everywhere and the clean up is very easy all you have to do is throw it in the washer. I actually removed the grass pad I originally had and just put the PoochPad in my pad holder that I have left from the potty patch and he uses it just like he did the grass pad. Thank you so much to the person who came up with these. This is a sanity saver and I plan on buying more!"
"I live in an area where there are about half a dozen stray cats. The neighbor feeds them and they keep coming back. I've tried playing with them before, but they would have no part of it... except for one grey cat that looked as though she hadn't eaten in a month.I put food out for her and brought her inside when it was time for treats or worming medicine... all went perfectly fine... she was getting chunky and was a happy cat. I planned on adopting her and allowing her to live inside with me, permanently, but decided to treat her for fleas first.I bought ""Sargeant's Gold Squeeze On for Cats and Kittens Over 5 lbs"" and applied the medication. The following day when I saw Lola, it looked like she was still wet where I put the medicine... it is ridiculously oily. The day after, I noticed her hair had fallen out. I thought to myself... ""well, that's strange, maybe she got in a fight and it's just coincidence?""The next few days, she was decreasingly active... she would respond more slowly when I called her to come in for food, and when she came in she would barely eat anything at all. I haven't seen the cat in three weeks... so I can't say for sure that this medication treats fleas and ticks, or that it kills cats - but I can tell you for sure that whatever it did, it changed Lola and she's not coming around anymore...."
"I have the same problem everyone else seems to have - my cats fling litter everywhere. This litter box almost eliminates that problem.It's also very easy to clean. I have already reccommended this product to other cat owners, and will continue to do so."
"I have an Am Staff with horrible skin issues. I hate having to have her on steroids and meds all of the time, and a co-worker told me about this spray, along with the shampoo. It is wonderful and has made a huge difference in her skin. I highly recommend this product."
"I bought this as a travel crate that we could use when bringing our metal crate wasn't an option. We've only used this product about 3-4 times with our 7 month old puppy that is used to being in a crate. The top bars that stabililize the roof became broken. They have a sliding, pull back and release motion that connects two rods to form the top roof bars. These pull back, plastic mechanisms broke at the factory bolt. I have no idea if this is even capable of being repaired. Needless to say, I am very dissappointed in the crate's performance under little to no use in 3 set up/take downs. I take care of my things and have not been rough with this crate in any way. I think it is cheaply made. I'd rather spend more money in hindsight and buy a better brand. I have an email into the company, but doubt that I will get anywhere with it."
"For the first few weeks, this automated litter box worked like a charm. At first, I was fairly impressed at the timing by which the rake would slowly scoop the litter and dump it into the recepticle, whose lid would open and close in concert with the movement of the arm. Never had any problems with the bowl spinning or with litter getting stuck, etc. Timing worked well, and our 2 cats seemed to enjoy using a nice clean box every day. Was pretty pleased initially...After about 6 weeks, however, the prongs on the rake would get stuck on the side of the bowl (with the prongs that stick directly into the litter itself). Once the rake got stuck, GAME OVER. It would make this horrible CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK noise that would wake me up at night so often that I finally unplugged the thing and had to use it for a few days as a plain old litter box. There was no way to prevent the rake from getting caught, other than removing one or two of the prongs on the rake, but what good is that if the end result is a less effective way to pick up litter? Hard to believe there was no override or way for the box to shut itself off when problems arise. Very poor design overall, one that was destined for failure.Since I had purchased it more than 30 days ago, I was worried I couldn't return it and was reay to pitch it in the trash. THANK GOODNESS for PetSmart's great return policy - or else I'd be out a cool hundred. My $$$ will be spent on the litter robot in the very near future.STAY AWAY from this item, unless you plan on purchasing one every 2 months or so."
"Im using this cable as a tie out for my alpine goa who I cannot keep from jumping over ANY fence. This was my last option for her. I connected one end of the cable to the back fence which is cemented into the ground and the other end that has a loop I connected a double ended snap to attach to her collar. I had tried tieing her before and she busted the cables from tsc rated for giant dogs. First thing she did was take off running full sprint thinking she was busting free. I had only hand tightened at that point and she did get loose. I strapped the cable back up to the back fence and tightened with pliers and the next time she took off running, she got to the end of the 100' and flipped herself right on her back. Held her good! Shes been on it over a week now and hasnt broke free so hopefully she stays content so I dont have to get rid of her."
"This is a great product. My puppy uses it as his den. I love the double door feature, if I need to move it I have the option to use either door."
"I purchased this product when we were getting our wonderful cat almost two years ago. It lasted about a year and a half and one of the lock down tabs broke. So, we bought another. Here is what I love about this litter box:It sincerely reduces the typical smell of a litter boxIt is easier to keep clean for our cat than any other I've ever usedScrubbing the box and replacing litter is no more complicated than other boxesThe dome on top lets his private business remain privateIt is strangely unobtrusive and you don't notice itThere really aren't many cons for me about this box. The lock down tab isn't as strong as the rest of the box. That is all I've got for cons."
We only use this for our cats. This is a nice lighter weight crate. For the money it is worth it.
"We have been using these dog treats for a long time. The dogs love them a lot! You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats. You end up with liver ""dust"" when the larger pieces are used. I generally take this ""dust"" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor. Therefore, no product gets wasted."
"This cable works really well. I have a Great pyrenees who is 8.5 months old and weighs 53 lbs. We are currently on our 2nd cable in 6 months. The 1st cable lasted for about 4 months which I think did really well considering that we use it daily. Our dog likes being outside as well as inside the house. We live on a Army base and did not want to rent a fence but at the same time we wanted our dog to have as much roaming room as a fence so we decided to get the 30 ft tie out. She has more roaming room then the dogs in fences do. This cable is very strong, there has been several times where my dog would go at a full blown sprint after a bird and the cable would not break. The 30 ft length offers a humane way to keep your dog in the yard as well as giving them ample amount of space to walk and roam. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that does not have a fence but still wants there dog to have room to roam and run back and forth"
"This is the only product that works for our Fox terrier. It will get on your hands so I am careful of that, but every other product does not deter. Have tried everything that is carried at in the stores locally."
"They are plastic plants, what can I say, not real exciting. I was pleased with the quality and qunatity I received. It was a better price than my local pet supply stores had."
"I purchased 4 of these in different colors and styles for my dogs. They look really nice and the quality is good. The clip on this feels more solid and secure than their old collars. The label says these are ""guaranteed for life (even if chewed)"". Sounds good to me!"
Kind of difficult to program. Works as advertised. Would like a simple button/over-ride to manually dump 1 cycle of food.
"G3s Synovi has helped our 14 year old English setter regain his ability to do stairs in our home. He was not able to climb or be comfortable lying down. For two years now, he has been able to move with greater ease and has less pain from his aging hips. Steroids could not give him the relief he has now.If your dog is suffering from joint or inflammation problems, give it a good 3 month try. I believe you will see a substantial change.I paid twice the price at local vet supplies until I found the internet source."
We are glad to see this product. It's the only one we use on our pets.
"This unit barely moves the water around in my 125 I have 3 filters on it I just wanted a little movement, Barely does it. Dunno if its a design flaw but I have a pulsating spray of micro bubbles coming from mine VERY ANNOYING as I love crystal clear water.. I used it for about a month and pulled it out of my 125 and going to use it on another tank since it was in my show tank and make it look like crap....."
"This is the second time I have used a cat dancer for my cats, and I have to say this is by far their favorite toy (after my hair ties, which I try not to use for obvious reasons).I was skeptical at how some cardboard on a wire would entertain my cats for a reasonable amount of time, but my cats seriously go nuts for this toy. My smaller cat can play with it for hours, and it actually gets my fatter kitty moving (which is the equivalent of the former).I just love this toy, and highly recommend it for kitty play time! The only caution is that for me, once my cats ripped off all of the cardboard, the blunt edge came apart and then had a pointy edge. I then threw it away to avoid my cats getting injured, and promptly purchased another one :)"
"It seems pointless to pay more to buy these preassembled, since it doesn't take any effort to change the filter pocket and pour in the charcoal. But if you have goldfish, they clog up quickly. Rinsing them every week or more is pretty gross. Of course, I probably have too small a tank and it wouldn't be as big a problem if I doubled my tank and filter size. Goldfish create a lot of waste product for their size.Re"
I bought two of these 4.5 months ago and they are still in one piece and I have a black lab who is a super chewer so that is a very impressive feat! I will buy more once these give out and will recommend to any dog owner!
I was optimistic about it even though I saw poor reviews and I bought it and it doesn't work in the slightest. All the ports are always on and never turn off. JUNK
I took out enough fur to make another dog with this. :) My dog seems to shed a lot less and his coat looks considerably glossier from removing all the undercoat.
Loved this product for the entire time I had it and so did my dog! You can put any size bottle on to suit your water needs. The only thing that keeps this review at 4 stars and not 5 is that the plastic threads that held it to the crate broke after a few years of use. But this was after years of daily use. Great product for the money.
I have aDrinkwell The Original Pet Fountain and HAve had the base fail 2 times in two years.It gets a small crack in the collar where the motor attaches ..I have not been taking the motor off for cleaning.. after the first one failedI think there must be problem with this product ???
My dog loves this bed. He used to sleep with me every night in my little twin size bed (and he isn't a small dog). I bought him this bed and he hasn't slept with me since. He absolutely loves it and is in it all the time.
"It is a great toy, my kitty loves it. One word of advise, keep it away from teenagers. They will drive you and the cat crazy."
I was so amazed at how much fur came off the first time. I have a cat with a lot of fur. The first time she jumped down and stood with this horrified look at the huge pile of her fur. But I keep doing it every 5 days and it just keeps her hair looking so wonderful with no knots and she doesnt shed much.
I have a beagle that sheds all over the place!! I was very pleased with this .. it works better than the shedding blade and the brushes that I got her. Her coat is very shiny and she loves this a lot more than any of the other methods. Only thing I don't like is that it does loosen up some of the hair and doesn't pick it up so I want to rub her down with one of those rubber mits maybe! Great product.
This thing hangs on the door way % it's kinda like on a big rubberband. The cat can bite it & pull it like 3 feet & let it go & it flings out of the mouth out. It's really cool. Like how a big rubberband flings when you pull it & let go on 1 end. This is a very safe toy. It hangs like a foot- 6 inches off the floor when it's hung on the door. So cats are too small to get tangled on it or choke & DIE!! Lol this toy is safe & fun. The toy keeps my cat entertained while I work all day & he plays with it while I'm sleeping too!! My cat is pretty hard on toys he likes & it took him like a month to get the eyes out & dismantle the Octopus from the bungee. So we just had to super glue it back together. It was real easy.
"FORGET THE BAGS! WORTHLESS!! Just use it and wash it with a pet safe cleaner. I use a $! squirt bottle with about 2 tbs of isopropyl alcohol and the rest water and RINSE WELL!! I use Feline Pine Cat Litter and I just put one tupperware bowl of it into the box and the next morning - every morning, we throw it in our bagged trash can. Then I spray the inside of the box with some natural cleaner and hose it out and leave it in the sun to dry. (I have two of these). I cannot stand the smell of old litter just sitting around, it's so unsanitary! Anyway, the box is GREAT. I bought TWO!I think this item is over priced as well, after all, it's a litter box. However, it is very sturdy and well made in comparison to other litter boxes. My cats are adjusting well, it DEFINITELY cuts DOWN on the litter all over my floor. That is one major plus!"
"I didn't use the litter that is made by the same company as the product says to. I use Arm & Hammer Active Naturals (as someone else commented that was what they used with it and it worked great for them). I noticed no difference in my cat who kept using the carpet instead of the litter box.I don't know what issue this is supposed to cure, but anger, hatred, and jealousy are not it! Seclusion in the basement from the other cats (whom he's grown up with since he was a baby) with his own litter box seems to be the only answer."
"I got my 12 pound dog the hide-a-squirrelKyjen PP01056 Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy, Largeand he LOVED it so I thought I would try one of these egg babies. I ordered the hedgehog and it looks exactly like it does in the picture. My one issue with this toy is that the opening that the eggs are supposed to go in and out of is way too small (in stark contrast to the hide-a-squirrel if you've tried it). My dog can't get the eggs out because of how tight the hole is, and I actually have a hard time getting them in and out.My dog still really likes the toy, and he can still squeak the eggs inside of the hedgehog so it kind of just ended up being a normal plush toy. The toy is a bit big so I wouldn't recommend it for very small, or toy dogs as they would probably have a hard time picking it up. Otherwise though, the toy is a great value and it comes with 5 total eggs (3 in the toy and 2 replacements) so even if your dog can't get the eggs out of the hole like it is supposed to it will probably still have some fun with it."
My big dogs enjoy this and it has not been chewed into a million pieces! That is success for me.
"People, rarely do I leave a review, but I feel obligated to leave one now. This item is crap. Do NOT waste your time or money. If it were worth my time and effort, I would return this defective item for a full refund. But for $10 - I am not going to full with it. Instead, I will leave this review for you to think about. I received this item for a new puppy but was misled into thinking it was more than one animal. That was the first problem. The second - the item that arrived was broken. That's right - the darn pig did not even ""pip"", squeak, or grunt. Third - the pig is so incredibly tiny that it is laughable. We actually laughed when we realized we had been duped.Save yourself the trouble and find something else. Unless you want a good laugh...."
She loves when the red light goes off. As soon as it turns on she runs right to it to give it a big hug. Great toy for cats but does not work.
this was a gift. was received as promised. The cat is very pleased with the item. Would recommend getting this with every panic mouse game as these are nicer then the ones it comes with.
this product is great ... i have 2 of them for the two openings to my kitchen.
"I ordered this product to use on my 1.5 year old Boxer Mix because she is having behaviorial issues such as jumping, tugging on leash, etc. The tone button worked occasionally with her such as when she was tugging on the leash. When it came to her jumping, I would have to use the ""SHOCK"" button and I say shock because I had to set it so high - 7 or 8 - for it to make any impact and at that point, it hurt her, causing her great pain. I returned the item and do not recommend the use of it on any animal."
"Unfortunately I did not inspect this item when it arrived, put it on my shelf for later use and when I opened it discovered the base of the heat emitter was cross threaded. What that means is it cannot be screwed into the fixture ... and since I didn't discover this defect until after the ""return window"" had passed I cannot return it for a refund. So, buyer beware. Test these things out as soon as you get them."
I have a Yellow Lab & you know how much they shed. Well theFurminator is the best brush I have ever used! Plus buying throughAmazon it was much cheaper then Petco. It was here in 2 days.Jen
"Product works well, have a littermaid too, but my cats seem to like the crystal litter better. trays are expensive, so I am going to see if I can clean them out to get more uses before throwing away"
Both my dogs really Love this Pad. I rarely bother to fill it with water which will make it heavy to move around which I do a lot. It has enough foam padding inside to make it comfortable as is. The other great feature is being Water proof and material is easy to wipe down/clean. During the day I have them placed in their A/C dog house and at night I move them onto the Pool Deck-Porch. I could buy 2 more and not have to move them. mainly just noting the flexibility of this product.
"I have owned, loved, bred and shown maine coon cats for over 11 years now and this is the first grooming tool that I have found to cut back on the shedding. It took some getting used to for all of us, but the end result is just wonderful. I use my medium sized furminator once a week and I no longer have to vacuum every other day! I will give you some pointers on use though"
"There are so many products that can be used to remove undercoats -- I probably own half of them! But we still have too much dog hair floating around the house. So when I saw the Oster Professional Pet Grooming Rake, I thought I should at least try it. I'm so glad I did because it actually works! I love it and our dog actually puts up with it too."
"This is the perfect sized container for my dog's food. I have a 15lb border terrier, and I buy a 13lb bag of food each time and can drop the whole thing in there (including the bag). It's a perfect fit. The lid seals the food up pretty good and it's easy to open and close. I was skeptical at first when seeing how the latch was online, with the molded connectors on the back, but it's pretty solid."
"I have a house full of pets. Two dogs and three cats. One of the cats needs weekly bathing - being a Persian with a massive coat.This particular cat has been bathed and dried with a hand held dryer since infancy and is mellow and used to the process. She doesn't object to that dryer.On the recommendation of ""cat"" people I purchased this particular Metro Air Force model based on avowals that it would cut the drying time in half.Let's just say that switching it on - demonstrated that it would be USELESS as a tool. It was so loud - that my placid Persian literally jumped for the ceiling and shredded my arms. My bird-dog - who has never been phased by loud noises promptly ran upstairs. Let's just say MAYHEM ensued.Whether it WORKS is MOOT if the animal is terrified. I'd advise that anyone considering this item test someone else's dryer on their pet BEFORE buying it."
"I'm not overly picky but this was supposed to help cut back on my workload in the house (3 dogs, 2 cats, 3 boys and my husband) but after only a week or so I have to take it all apart and clean it really well, change filter, too, or the water has a stink to it that my cats won't go near. After about 4 days I can feel slime in the bowl and then the smell starts. I know how to clean it- and I use HOT water, mild soap and I dry it.Unfortunately, I procrastinated when deciding to return it and now it's way too far past return window. Lesson learned.I'm glad it seems to work so well for most everyone who has reviewed it, though!"
I've taken to running it at night only. Keeps my golfish 50 gallon pretty clean just running 12 hrs/day.NOT quiet though.
"I was a little concerned after reading several reviews that dogs did not tolerate the Gentle Leader. But I decided to take my chances and am glad I did. I wanted to add my .02 to the 400+ other reviews that if your dog generally will let you touch his face, brush his teeth, etc that it's likely he will tolerate the Gentle Leader. He has no problem with me putting it on because he knows it means we are going for a walk! I have taken my dog out for walks three times so far and at first he did try to paw it off but when I gently kept him moving forward he was too busy walking to keep pawing, and got used to it fairly quickly.I did have to watch the video to figure out how to snap the nose piece adjuster, it wasn't intuitive (at least to me!) and the instruction guide didn't show details. So it's great that it does come with a video! Also it was $10 cheaper on Amazon than at Petco.With all that said, I am thrilled with the instant change in walking my 50+ pound German Shepherd! He loves to go for walks (and so do I) but whenever we'd see another dog he would get all excited and want to go visit (exuberantly). Not so good for me, my hands would get sore from having to hold the leash so tightly. Plus even without dogs around he wanted to walk faster than me and there was always tension on the leash, despite trying all the methods I learned from dog obedience classes to get him to heal nicely. We have encountered several dogs and people that he would like to visit but as soon as he tries to pull he is forced to look at me, I praise him, and he calms down and walks normally. No more sore hands!!"
Great coat. There could be a slight improvement by making the velcro strap moreadjustable for a tighter fit for slightly smaller dogs.
Our two small dogs LOVE this toy! One of our dogs carries the squirrels around squeaking them all the time. They can't get enough. And it's such a great price! Can't go wrong.
The product sucked. It was hard to insert batteries. It did not turn as it should have. The cold packs were insufficient.
Tommie my ferrel cat loves it. He brings his girlfriend over and they cuddle. Yes he is fixed their relatonship is just platonic. I think. Anyway it is life saver for him in the winter
"i thought this dog food container was expensive, but it is worth every dollar. it is air tight !!!!!!! i keep it on the back porch. no ant or any other critter can get in it.!!! very well made, heavy duty, made to last."
"With two new active small dogs from the pound (20# and 22#, I am very glad I ordered this crate for their ""home"". They seem to love it and go in there when they need a little peace and quiet from the kids. It's sturdy, was easy to assemble (10 minutes). I love having two doors (side + front) so that you can position it to fit the space and choose which side is best to have the door open, or just have both open so they can go in and out easily. I wish the grating was a just little wider - I can't get my hand all the way in to pet the dogs and it's a little more exercise to get the treat to the right dog without the other dog jumping for it. But this is minor. I put the dogs in when I need to keep the front door open for a bit, like carrying groceries in or recycling out, or for the first 10-15 minutes when we have visitors (before I open the door so they calm down first). I'm glad I don't have to put them outside or in another room - here, I can easily keep an eye on them. The treats are on top of the crate so it's handy to give them a ""good dog treat"" when I want them inside."
"This is the best training pad I have found to use with my beagle. Other pads he refuses to use or plays with them. This pad has helped him to become potty trained. There are no more messes around the house, if he does have an accident in the house its always on one of the pads. Great large size allows for more area for him to go on. Very absorbent, never have leakage off of it or through it even when I am picking them up."
"..i ordered i package two weeks ago and thought awww kindda pricey but still not to shabby a price so i order one more package for the future to stick aside , WELL too bad they have DOUBLED IN PRICE , i just ordered 3 days ago ONE package of Furry Mice Assorted 2 "" 12 ct. and were $3.99 plus $4.99 sh total of $8.98 ..

"Pros:+ Cats obviously love it - often they play in the stream of water - and vets say they tend to drink more when it's a pleasurable experienceCons:- Cleaning is a pain. Literally. I have arthritis in my hands, so removing the motor is not only difficult but it actually hurts me. (my husband's hands are fine, but he's so annoyed with the cleaning process that he's flat-out refused to do it).- This is our second Drinkwell in less than 2 years. The first stopped running after we'd had it little over a year. (Sure, we could have bought a new motor, but Drinkwell's cust service only said it PROBABLY was a bad motor. We could bet $20 to find out). And now the second one is making a grinding sound."
"This food is more like what animals SHOULD be eating- filled with real meats and seafood, etc. Not the garbage fillers you see is most canned foods. My kitties ran to the kitchen when they smelled the food but when I put it on their plates they took a couple of nibbles and left it. I tried this for about a week and finally went back to their original canned stuff. Too bad :(But I will say that they LOVE the dry cruncher food from Innova, they can't seem to get enough of that."
"Thanks to a combination of Hi-Tor Neo Diet and Vita Gravy (and the sub-q fluids prescribed by the vet) my cat, who was given a diagnosis of advanced kidney failure and a certain impending death sentence two months ago, has amazed my vet and everyone in the vet's office. As a previous poster has already said, many renal failure cats are presribed the Hill's k/d or a/d diets and they absolutely hate it and won't eat it. My cat would not touch the stuff -- wouldn't even smell it -- I had to force feed him for weeks. I finally found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet, which is almost as low protein/phosphorous as the Hill's prescription diets. My cat loves it and is finally gaining back some weight. The vet had also prescribed some vitamin drops, which he also hates. Then I found ""Vita-Gravy"", which is also available at Pet Food Direct. He loves the taste of the Chicken Vita-Gravy mixed with the Hi-Tor Neo. Now he's getting the extra nutrition he needs to balance his blood levels, while really enjoying the taste! If your cat has renal failure and is refusing to eat, you might want to try this combo. Good luck! I hope your kitty fares as well as mine has so far."
"My son has a couple of very hairy cats. I enjoy grooming them and bought this tool, FURminator deshedding tool, to try out. It seemed to be very effective in removing hair, clumps and knots, without distressing the cat."
"With 7 large Greyhounds of my own plus fostering new Greys from the track all the time, this house has a minimum of 10 Greys in it at all times. I own and foster only special needs Greyhounds (never a shortage of them), mostly due to broken legs and hocks at the track. I make glucosamine a daily staple in their morning meals (with my Vet's approval of course), regardless of their ages. I've tried countless products, some they liked and some they turned their snouts up in rebellion. Even my 3 older ones who have about 7 teeth total among them like these. (For my toothless wonders, I crush them before adding to their bowl-break into pieces in my hands then use a small 'smack and chop' chopper on the cutting board and scoop the small pieces into individual bowls). My other 4 who still have most of their teeth wait for me at the top of the cellar stairs while I'm filling their bowls and placing one of these peanut butter biscuits on the top of each. While 1-2 try to distract me as I'm hauling all these bowls up the stairs, the others bob and weave in attempts to steal the treats out of the bowls as I near the top of the steps. Have to admit defeat on occasion when I'm not paying attention :(In any event, haven't met a Greyhound yet who does not love these. Not only that, I have seen remarkable improvement in agility, desire to play and romp, renewed interest in toys, consistent improvement in ease in pouncing on the beds, serious athleticism in swiping the tomatoes from my topsy turvys in the yard, even stealing a 3 lb pumpkin off the back step to munch on behind the tree in the back yard. The younger ones have resumed 'running laps' around the yard while the older ones (2 are 11, 9, 8, 5 and 2 are 4) seem younger and instigate play more often than before. They are energetic, not as stiff after a nap or nighttime, want to do more, play more, walk more/further and, while it may be my imagination, the older ones seem to be eating better. (They had gotten to a point where sometimes they would eat, sometimes not, sometimes just nibble a few bites and walk away).All in all, they like this product and I am thrilled already with the positive changes I see in my 'kids' who are always with me and the fosters who arrive in rough shape but leave for happy, responsible homes upon adoption. I dislike pumping meds into any pet when something else will help. I'm sticking with this product. It works for me and mine. I wouldn't purchase 7-10 6 lb bags of this product at a time if my pups weren't exhibiting such remarkable improvements. Their quality of life has definitely improved. Packaging says to allow 4-6 weeks for best results but it took less than 3 weeks for me to begin seeing significant changes in all of my guys and gals. Can't wait to see what 6+ weeks of using this product will produce!Each ALL NATURAL biscuit contains 500 mg glucosamine and is a substantial 'treat'. Biscuits are approx. 3-4"" long and perhaps .75"" high and quite crunchy to promote strong teeth and healthy gums. They are a bit difficult to break other than in halves. After that initial break, they are too tough to break into smaller chunks, thus the need for my abovementioned 'chopper'. Each bag purchased to date has arrived in excellent condition. Out of 14 6-lb bags to date (2 separate orders), only 2 biscuits were broken in half; nothing was crushed or broken into small chunks. Very little residue at bottom of resealable bags. Unfortunately, I did count the biscuits in the first 2 (original order) bags to determine whether or not I would stick with this product pricewise, but I've forgotten now what that count was so I cannot share that at this time. And because I'm back to order more, if I remember, I'll update this review when I count them again. Directions for use"
"I bought the ball for my dog to play with while I ran errands. He seemed to enjoy it, but after one week, a large portion of the yellow rubber part of the ball was torn off and probably had been eaten. The yellow part appeared to be glued together by flimsy glue. Not cool. If your dog was an aggressive chewer, I wouldn't recommend it unless you were supervising your dog while playing."
"I give my dog 1 Greenie in the morning, he loves them and the vet that he goes to says they are the best for keeping their teeth strong and clean.I highly recommend these for your dog or cat for the health of it."
"While no one toy is THE answer to keeping your pet exercised and mentally engaged, I have found that this toy is a MUST HAVE. My cats come back to it often to scratch (they have NEVER messed up furniture) stretch, play with the ball in the tunnel (some cats just are not into this feature, others can't live without it) or just use it as a fine place to sit for awhile. My small dogs also enjoy trying to chase the ball out of the tunnel. This ball won't get lost!"
"I've been sitting our 8 yr old Grandkitty for 3 months. She suffers from PTSD after 2 terrorizing vet procedures. She misses her mom, my daughter; took weeks for her to feel safe & warm warm-up to us. On the first night she claimed the head pillows on our bed as her own. Nightly stand-offs were not going well. This inexpensive bed was an attempt to keep her fine, chocolate brown fur off the bed & provide her a sense of security by staking a claim. Believe it or not, she took to it right away; she seemed to know it was for her. Here's what I found:I chose the smaller version to fit on our bed, yes, day & night. It fits her well, even though she's a med-large, pudgy lady. It's been run through the washer, nothing fancy, a 12 yr old top-load, on delicate cycle w/cold water, then dried w/easy heat. Came out brand new. The material and weave on the bottom (kinda like a med-weight poly sports canvas) makes it semi-waterproof which helped protect our coverlet from the hair ball I had to wash-up. (Luckily it landed in her bed, not ours!) Almost bought the fleece bed for softness, but this faux fur is truly soft, not stiff or scratchy as feared. The bottom isn't heavily padded, so it wouldn't be that much protection from a hard or very cold floor. However, it's easy to move around so it'd likely be good for a car ride or on the bottom of a kennel w/a few towels underneath for padding for the older or arthritic pet. The rolled edge is just enough to make her feel comfortably confined and, she often sleeps w/her head on it as a pillow. Although it's not a prob on our bed, the bottom is rather slick so it'd probably slide around a bit over a hard floor. She's not a 'curled-up' sleeper so she takes up most of the space on this bed. Unlike a smaller, closed-in cat bed, our grandkitty likes to be able to snuggle-in yet see what's happening around her at all times. So, this open concept bed suits her best.I need to buy 3 more. We have 3 young feline adoptees who were abandoned at a Fire Station at only 4.5 weeks old (guess the previous owner thought there was a baby cat drop-off, no-questions-asked law). They're complete opposites; relaxed, friendly, people-like in affection. Even so, for them, like my grandkitty, it's probably a good idea to get them accustomed to a portable bed in case they ever have to go to a sitter, kennel or visiting. They'll have the comfort of their own bed, handy to take along to remind them of home. I know my grandkitty's bed will follow her home for continued snoozing & enjoyment. I recommend this bed for others to try. On the other hand, if you're a pet guardian, especially a cat parent, you know there's no absolute way to predict if a pet will take to the bed we want them to use!I thought it was a good purchase & value. But then, it made the grandkitty happy, what's not to like?"
Length:
These test strips do the job.No complains so far. This is the second time I get them.I will buy them again once I am done with the current set.This word count rule by Amazon is ridiculous.
I actually bought this gate to keep our pet from coming up stairs to our bedroom during the nights. It works wonderful and everyone in the family is able to use it.
"Save your money! Keep the bags from your grocer for free, and throw the poop in the trash. The Doggie Dooley doesn't work six months out of the year because of the cold (of course the company doesn't tell you this until you've bought it). When it does work, it does so poorly. It is a complete pain to maintain. The flimsy plastic on mine broke before the year was up where the lid hinge is. If you want to waste your money, just set it on fire."
These litter locker refills work okay. The only problem I have had is finding the end when I start a new pack. This can be frustrating and costly if I have to use them double because of not getting the end when started.
The description says it can accommodate up to a 220lb dog. My dog is 87lbs and the flimsy lock and flimsy pastic already broke after less than 3 mos.
"I was introduced to Vetri-DMG by my vet for one of my chihuahuas that has a seizure disorder. The vet reccommended it as a neurological vitamin and said I should try it before treating the animal with a daily prescription medication. The dog had been having seizure type episodes every 2-3 months and since using the product it happens once a year if that. I'm not sure how it works but it works! It is so good, I give it to the other chihuahua too as a nutritional supplement just for her general health."
"I don't want to give this product too low of a review, because it did clean my pets fur well and was not irritating to his skin or eyes. We did not like however the baby powder smell (which seems to be the scent for most puppy shampoo)... but the smell did not last once his fur dried. For the next two days our puppy smelled like a wet dog. This part was disappointing to us"
"My GSD is happy with her new Nylabone chew bone. She had the smooth one last time and seems to like this one even more, great for keeping those teeth clean."
Our vet unit hardly made it a week. This one is much more flexible and forgiving and so far will seem to last much longer.
My dogs just love these little talking toys I like that the talking part comes out so the toy can be washed and treats put in its place. I sometimes move the voices around so the bear quacks and the duck roars just for fun
The puppies love this bed! We have an old house with drafty wood floors and the pups would always want to sleep on the couch. Now they don't have to.
This is a great mat. It fit our crate perfect. I love the color. It is so soft and our dogs like the raised lip. It washes up nicely too. Very happy with it.
"I absolutely love this crate. I have one that I bought about 3 years ago to hold my dog at agility trials. I have tried 2 other soft crates during that time for my second dog and both of those are worn out but not this one. I had each of those for less than a year. I just purchased another because I was so pleased with the first one I purchased. It is not for dogs who are active in their crate or who scratch & chew at a crate. Hello people, it IS a fabric crate. Dogs have to be crate trained and let's face it any dog can get out of a fabric crate if it wants to. As far as fabric/travel crates go this one is a great value."
I HAVE SEARCHED ALL OVER FOR THE BEST PRICE ON THIS PRODUCT.I HAVE BEEN TO STORES IN 3 COUNTIES AND I HAVE SEARCHED ONLINE.FRONTLINE PLUS IS THE SAME NO MATTER WHERE YOU BUY IT AND AMAZON ENDED UP BEING 1/6TH OF THE PRICE.ALL I CAN SAY IS AMAZON IS AMAZING!!
"My black lab mix loves these. It doesn't take very long (probably an hour or so) for him to remove the top ""dome"" part of the treat and make it a flat cookie inside the blue dispenser ball. The flat part of the treat lasts another four or five days until it's just a ring inside the ball and finally the ring will take him about another week to remove and consume. He loves these things so much that I have to put refills in his ball while he is outside doing his business or I can't even get enough space in the kitchen to pop the new one in before he's trying to take it back! And even when the ball is empty he carries it around and licks around the inside of the dispenser part. I guess he's licking the smell out haha!"
"Our cat has kidney problems and this medicine keeps him feeling fine. It's like a probiotoc that helps the kidneys function and as long as he takes one every day, he seems to have no health problems at all! I truly believe this is a miracle for pets with kidney disease."
"Yes, it is expensive, but this actually works. My bichon-poodle had awful tearstains, and they are almost completely gone after a month of use. She's a very picky eater, so I was worried this would be difficult to get her to eat everyday, but she loves it. She actually licks the Angels Eyes off of the dry dog food and leaves the kibble for later. Buy this, it works."
"I have been using this product for 3 weeks. So far, I've made about 100 gallons of RO/DI water for my marine aquarium, and my only regret is not purchasing an DR/DI filter years ago. I just hook it up to my kitchen sink faucet. There was no need for crazy plumbing projects. I am a little bit concerned about the longevity of the filtering system. The initial batch came out at about 8 parts-per-million total-dissolved solids (ppm TDS), but I'm already up to 15 ppm. However, this is still a pretty low TDS, and I might even be contaminating it just by measuring or something, so I'm not too concerned yet. I do have a couple tips that might make your choice-of-purchase or set-up easier.1) Unless you plan on installing some kind holding tank and auto-shut off, this filter takes time. Remember, 50 gallons per day is only about 2 gallons per hour. If you don't think you have the patience for that, consider upgrading to a higher GPD.2) I read some reviews of RO filters that costumers were unhappy because the filtered water was acidic and/or made metal parts rust very quickly. This is not a flaw in the filter - this means it's working. RO/DI water has much less dissolved materials than most tap water. Without getting into the chemistry, this means that (1) when the water come to equilibration with the carbon dioxide in the air, it will be acidic, and (2) it will tend to oxidize (rust) metals that it comes in contact with.I use my filtered water to make home-made soda and ice cubes, but I think drinking the RO water straight is pretty gross - it just tastes awful to me. I've also heard it can be unhealthy, but I don't have much info on that.3) This filter works under rather high pressure, so there is a good chance that connections will leak. When you are assembling it, I recommend getting some teflon thread tape from the plumbing section of your hardware store. Wrap the tape tightly 2-3 times around the threads before fitting the connections to tighten everything up an prevent leaks.4) I had trouble installing the RO cartridge. The cartridge housing is not see-through, so I couldn't tell if I was installing it correctly or not. I could not tell if it was assembled correctly until I had it completely assembled to test it. But you should be able to tell if it is working by the amount of water it is producing; when working correctly, you should be producing clean water at only a trickle (~50 GPD). If you set up the filter and are getting a high flow from the product [blue] tube, you can probably assume the RO cartridge is not installed correctly. (Also, you can check the TDS if you have a meter.) It took me about four tries to get the RO cartridge installed correctly. The thing was, it needed to be pushed very hard into the fitting. The resistance was so high that I was afraid to break it.5) Many of the fitting on the unit come pre-assembled. A couple of connections on my unit initially leaked just a bit. You may need to unscrew them, wrap some teflon tape around the threads and reinstall. After I took the time to do that, my unit was 100% leak-free.6) The unit comes with an adapter that should allow you to use it with a standard sink, but installing the adapter takes a few minutes or more, and is kind of a hassle. Also, the adapter is a pretty cheap plastic, so it's prone to leaking and liable to get chewed up if you're not careful installing it every time. I alleviated this issue my permanently replacing the head of my sink faucet with one that I can directly screw the filter on to; this only cost about $3. I did not have to replace the whole faucet, but the very end has outside threads like a garden-hose connection. This has made connecting and disconnecting the filter much more convenient.Also, be aware that if you have a decorative sink faucet, the adapter might not work. You might have to be creative in installation. I live in an apartment, so I can't do any really involved plumbing projects; however, if I were in a house, I think it would be worth the effort to set the filter up with a holding tank and float valve, so that I there is always an available supply of filtered water.7) I also purchased TDS meter (HM Digital TDS-EZ Water Quality TDS Tester), and was glad that I did. It is very convenient to be able to test and see how your unit is working. My tap water comes out around 500 ppm. My filtered water has been coming out between 5 and 15 ppm. Since I can check the TDS any time I want, it will be much easier to figure out when my filter needs to be back-washed or replaced."
"Coat is a little thinner than I thought, but nice-looking and perfect for cool (though not freezing cold) days. We like it."
"This has to be the best small sized dog lead I have ever purchased, the others in comparison used to jam on rewind or release, tangle or not lock. Very good quality build, compact, comfortable to hold or hang off your wrist and looks sleek, no bad things to say about this product. A nice improvement would be to increase the lead length another 1 to 2 metres."
I was dubious about the Furminator before trying it -- how could one cat comb be different from another? The Furminator is different! In just a few strokes I was able to remove much more hair than I would have with the cat comb I already had. This is especially good for the cat the doesn't like being combed -- so much more hair can be removed in the couple of strokes I can get in before he refuses any more combing.
"Great item! It has been very frustrating for me finding a clipper that works for my toy pooddle's hair. I have tried so many others brands and spent money, but I finaly found what I was looking for that really works. Thanks"
"My dog is rather smart, so I've found it a challenge to keep him mentally occupied for longer than 15 minutes with any type of toys - Busy Buddy, frozen Kongs, anything. The mini Buster Cube has finally done the trick. I just put his normal serving of food (1/2 cup) in here and set it to the most difficult setting, and he's busy for about half an hour, which is wonderful!The cube is easy to fill and use, easy to clean and doesn't seem prone to breaking, so I would highly recommend it."
This cleaner has a very sweet odor.Care must be taken around pets and children.Ihad to leave the house for 4 hours.The powder does work and must remain in placefor the 24hour period.Thank goodness I have no children or pets.
The bed is nice and sturdy. My dog did put a hole in it after a few weeks. Not sure if after such a short use if a replacement cover would be worth it.
"This coat was purchased for a dog named Claire. I met her on Face Book. She came from a abusive situation into a foster ""Foster To Furever"". She had a wish list on Amazon for Claire and this was on it. Well I fell inlove with this dog, she's a Great Dane and had 4 different skin conditions so she had no hair. The foster said this coat was perfect for her. So nice and warm and she looked quite dapper in it as well. Thank you Amazon."
"I have been using one of these dispensers for years. The last one lasted about 7 years before the bottle developed a crack in it. Works like a charm to keep enough water available for 2 large dogs in Arizona (I have the larger size). It is not without care in cleaning though. To keep water clean, occasionally I put some bleach in the bottle and fill with hot water. Allow to set for awhile then rinse very well. This will keep things like algae and mold from growing in the bottle. I wash the bottom out with hot soapy water periodically and every once in awhile put some bleach in it and fill it up to soak as well. Other than that it is very carefree and I feel good knowing my doggies have enough water available. I will always have one of these around."
"This feeder/ waterer is the best kind there is! I've tried others, with many problems! The Bergan combo is very good quality too! You won't be sorry with this item!!"
This item is kinda cheap.It is hard to get on a window sill.you'll need a deep window sill for this to work.
"I bought this leash for my four month old English Mastiff puppy and it took her no time to chew completely through the leash. She was only 38 lbs at that point so I was pretty disappointed with this product. It felt super sturdy and I guess if your dog isn't a big chewer, than it would be a great buy, other than that, I wouldn't recommend it.HOWEVER, I did call Lupine to see if they would replace the leash for free like they claim, and they do! So, that is nice except that you have to mail it back. The other option is to find a store in your area that sells Lupine products and they can swap it out. I am getting a new leash at a local store that is willing to swap mine out for a new one. So, super friendly customer service at Lupine!"
"These fit great and look very cool. They don't protect as much as I thought, but the dog doesn't lose any field of vision. So that's a plus."
"For me, the claws were easy to slip on. I practiced without putting glue in them first, as recommended by another reviewer. make sure to cut your cats claws before gluing. It has been 24 hours and my cat only got one off, which wasn't on tight due to user error. They don't seem to bother her anymore as she isn't trying to get the rest off. And she can't scratch us to wake us up anymore. I do miss her claws while playing with toys, but while renting I have to follow certain rules and I refuse to de-claw her. This product is an EXCELLENT alternative to declawing. However, I would not use this on outside cats as they need their claws."
I have had a fish tank for many years and I currently have clown loaches in my tank. They love blood worms and these worms did not disapoint. They wait for me in the mornings and follow me as I walk around the tank waIting for breakfast. First time I have used this brand but they seem to love it.
"I did quite a bit of research before ordering this product for use in an automatic litter box. It does a great job of clumping and, best of all, as long as the cat covers over his business, it kills the smell. I will continue ordering this product as long as I use this litter box. But be careful when you order because some of the listings for this product are eligible for free shipping and some are not."
"We have used a lot of harnesses and collars for dogs - we foster for a local rescue. Of all the ones we have tried, this one is the best. It provides great control over dogs thats pull, and it doesn't come up around the neck area to choke the dog. Wonderful!"
"My dog loved this toy, getting the squirrels out seemed fun and he quickly discovered how to dig into it. Unfortunately after he got the squirrels out the next funnest part was to get the squeakers out. One by one he tore the individual squirrels apart and got the squeakers out of them. After that he started tearing apart the actual housing part of the toy. It lasted about 3 months until the housing was ripped apart too much to keep around, which is decent for a daily used dog toy, I suppose. However it was less then a month before the first squirrel had to be thrown away.It's definitely a great toy, I prefer toys that make a dog think a little bit, and so did our dog. I might try the ""Ginormous"" size one, and see how long it lasts. For the price it's definitely worth checking out."
"This litter is great. A fraction of the price of my usual litter and just as good. Plus, I find it difficult to find unscented litter lately, so that's a bonus. No perfumes! My two kitties haven't noticed that it's not their usual unscented litter. The only ""problem"" is lifting the 40 pound bag. But that's the only drawback (and you can actually open the bag and use a bucket or small container to scoop the litter from the bag and carry it to the litter pan or just carry the pan to the bag). I'll be using this from now on!"
"Duralactin was recommended to me by our veternarian for our dog Dante who has some hip arthritis, and an old knee injury. He is 5 years old, weighs about 70lb, is strong and muscular and has always been active. Dante had trouble getting comfortable when sitting and lying down, hobbled when he walked, and could no longer jump into the car or onto the bed. He was also having trouble going up and down steps and could hardly even get on and off the couch. We had been giving Dante a glucosamine supplement which was had helped but he was still having some discomfort and mobility problems. We started giving him the Duralactin in addition to the glucosamine and within a week we noticed a definite improvement. After about a month we could tell that Dante felt so much better. He can now walk and run more comfortably without limping and can sleep through the night. I was overjoyed when he jumped right into the car one day and then a couple of weeks later onto our bed! I also like that the ingredient in this product is a milk protein, making it safe to use long-term for chronic conditions. Dante also likes the taste of the tablets, he's pretty picky so I was a little worried, but it's easy to give, he thinks he's getting a treat. I am so glad that we tried Duralactin, it has made a difference in the quality of life for Dante!"
"I needed to keep the cats away from the trees with my birdfeeders. I ordered this after checking with the manufacture and being assured that it would keep the cats away but wouldn't affect the birds. When I first put them out....hurray, the cats were gone but so were the birds. After about a week the cats are back and walk right past the CatStop but the birds are still gone. It worked on the wrong thing."
"We started getting bit and seeing fleas at the start of the summer. I had never had any kind of infestation, so I tried the home remedies of vacuuming everywhere and washing everything in hot water. Then I bought this Hartz Carpet Flea Powder and put it everywhere. The fleas just kept coming and getting worse.I bought 3 RAID bug bombs, each rated for 4000 sq feet. I set them ALL off in my 1400 square foot apartment. It must have had fertalizer because a week later, despite continued vacuuming, they continued strong as ever.Finally, I bought the carpet spray and misters from Adams. It took 3 cans of the spray and VERY DETAILED spraying (Follow the directions conservatively. I sprayed about 4 inches from the carpet and oversprayed in problem areas). The fleas were still there for a couple days (very few) but then died off. And now it has been 7 days and not one flea.Awesome product. Also bought the Flea Trap light and it worked well to control things until I sprayed with Adams."
"A quality filter and priced very fair, these can be rinsed out a few times extending there use, the shipping is fast, and there made in the US, lets buy American, i use these filters in all my tanks and have been very pleased with the way they help keep my tanks very clean, i give these a 5***** thumbs up, a very good filter"
Excellent quality for price paid and received when indicated.Wasn't able to find this size and type in local pet stores.
"I recently adopted a 7 year old border collie whose mouth looked and smelled like she'd been snacking on feces for years. My vet checked her teeth and said that I should give teeth brushing a try before putting her under general anesthesia for a cleaning. After a few months of teeth brushing to little change, I purchased this spray and it has changed our lives. My dog can give everyone kisses without gagging us, and she's a happy member of the bed at the end of the day. After 1 day, her breath was noticeably better. I've been using the product for about 6 weeks now and her plaque is just chipping away. I'm sure that in a few weeks, her teeth will be sparkling white. This product seriously works."
Waste of money it was recommended by a sale person for teething for my puppy and she shredded it. Nylabone and antlers worked way better!
"My dog is very sensitive to anything with meat since she was born. I have always fed her natural balance Vegan. I became aware of genetically modified ingredients and called natural balance and asked if they had any GMOs in their food and they told me no. I am skeptical since the rice in the united stated is now becoming GMO and many other hidden ingredients including vitamins. I found this product and was very happy its Organic, I started feeding my dog the food and she is very picky and loved it. I will be transferring her food to this one since its organic. Very happy customer and dog!"
"I bought this after reading the glowing reviews on Amazon.I thought it was great for the first week or so, no more scooping, yay!Then, the negatives started showing.- The regular size box is too small for my 13 pound cat. (So for those who want to get this box, I recommend the Large size.)- The clips, though they didn't break off on me, weren't very secure and are very flimsy. I always had to double check to make sure they were secure before rolling after a couple of accidents where half the cat box contents spilled all over the floor.- Even when the clips were secure, litter would leak out on the side mid-roll. As a result, I'd always have to vacuum every time I tried to clean the box (twice a day).- Clumps often got stuck on the grill, and they were difficult to get off. Cleaning the box is a nightmare. I had to disassemble, scrub the top (sometimes there was dried poop stuck to the top because of the rolling action), then really scrub the grill thoroughly (took forever due to stuck clumps), scrub the pan (and the spots where the grill inserts into the pan almost always had litter I couldn't get out because of clumps there)...every time I washed the box, it took me a good half hour to 45 minutes to get it completely clean, dry, and odor free.- While the rolling action is great, the smaller clumps go right through the grill. I still have to take off the lid every three days to manually scoop out the smaller clumps.- Didn't contain smells. Two weeks after a thorough cleaning, the box smelled terrible, probably because of the dried poop stuck to the top.I went back to a regular scooping box with a lid, and after my experience with Omega Paw Roll n Clean, it's been a dream. No more litter all over the floors, no more vacuuming twice a day, no more spilling litter all over my foot whenever I try to clean the cat box, and no more wasted litter."
This was a great purchase. Very cost effective way to control the dog that pulls too hard when you are walking. Now we can walk her without getting a sore arm in the end. She learned very quickly and walks gently and still gets to go on adventures
"We have a 1 year old great dane puppy that is a VERY strong chewer. He destroys most toys in less than 5 minutes, including Kong toys (except for the original Kong) and all of the other supposedly indestructable toys. However, he has had this ball for a couple of weeks now and has chewed on it like crazy and played with it non-stop and has yet to damage it...much less tear it into a million pieces like most other toys. I am so happy with this product!"
"I ordered this for my Corgi Sadie after hearing that a dog's food bowls should be elevated off the floor even to a dogs stomach. At first, she was scared whenever the bowls would clank against the stand, but she was over that in a few days. Now, I don't see a big puddle of water around the water dish. The stand helps to avoid the water slopping over the edge of the bowl. Plus, it looks very stylish in our kitchen. Not just your run of the mill dog bowls."
"I like this size miracle brush just like the small one, it is good for larger dogs. I like the quality of this product."
"This was a fun package to receive. It's loaded with colorful mice and our cat went to what we set out for him immediately. It's been a fun time to watch whenever he takes a notion to play with a mouse and that is often. It's a great toy, I love seeing the cat play and he loves the mice. All a win, win experience. I will say the tail on the first mouse has disappeared. I haven't found it so it may have been eaten. Our cat's mouth opens as large as his head so I do wonder if he may swallow one of these mice, not just a tail at sometime or other. Anyway, these are a 5 star item. The rating coming from the cat."
"The ZoomGroom is great for helping to get mud and grit out of my dog's fur. My dog doesn't mind it at all, and even likes to chew on it some of the time-- which it has held up to wonderfully!"
"I have ordered this brand of dog chews for about 5 years and my Jack Russell Terrier still loves them. Her stomach is easily upset, but these chews do not bother her. They are also reasonably priced."
"I am trying to reduce use of plastic bags, these do the trick, glad it comes in large quantity as I have a great dane and chocolate lab to clean up after"
"First, I have a 65 lb. Boxer with a deep chest. I purchased the XL and I am happy I did because anything smaller would not have fit his chest. My dog is getting older and losing his hair. He hated going outside when it was cold. Now that he has his &#34;cape&#34; it keeps him cozy and he goes out with no resistance. Two things I don't like; first the chest and underbelly are very exposed and the jacket itself attracts hair. what i do like my dog likes it and it keeps him warm. i would recommend this to anyone who needs a good jacket for their dog"
"I bought this spray to help calm my cat during a long car ride and moving to a new home. I've been using it with Rescue Remedy and it seems to help, but only for a short period of time. I notice that after I spray this product my cat seems sleepy and her eyes start to droop. This has been helpful at night when she's meowing loudly but it only seems to help her calm down for about an hour. Still, I'm ordering the diffuser with the hope that it will provide more of a long-term effect. I think it works better than Rescue Remedy, which is difficult to administer (especially for a nervous cat that refuses treats when she's really scared)."
This thing works amazing. Hair basically falls while using it. It also helps remove dead skin from your dog or cat as well. Both my dogs love when I use this on them and just sit patiently relaxed as I brush them. Would recommend this to anyone. One of my dogs is long-haired and the other one is medium haired and it works great on both of them. A+
"This product works wonders especially with the spray. I have a 3 year old Shih Tzu with allergies, flaky skin a sour smell coming from him. I have been through so many shampoos with no luck, the sour odor came back in about 3 hours, somebody had suggested that I get him tested at a vet. Are you kidding me!!! Who has the money for a 500 dollar allergy exam. I then took it up myself to do some research on line and this product came up. As the directions said shampoo your dog 2 to 3 times in the first 2 weeks. After the first bath the odor was not present anymore, after his second his skin started to look better, less flaky and no more redness on his skin."
"Needed a larger water bottle for my 75lb Bernese Mountain Dog and this 32 ouncer seemed like the perfect one. I used it once. It leaked like crazy, the rubber seal came off right away, and the plastic hinge tore almost immediately. Do not purchase this item, you will be thoroughly disappointed."
"I have used this brand of drinking fountain for my dogs and cats for a few years. After seeing the dogs and cats lick their butts and then go get a drink of water, I decided that they really didn't need filtered water! Save your money and leave the filters out. Your animals won't care."
"Our toy poodle had terrible tears. After sprinkling Angels' Eyes on his food, within a week or so, they were gone! At first we tried the whole mixing it with peanut butter and putting it inside his Kong toy, but honestly that was a lot of work and he eats it up regardless of how we give it to him."
"Excellent food with first ingredient being deboned chicken. My border collie loves it and is doing well on it. It was delivered quickly and Amazon's price was better than anywhere I had ever purchased from. I also didn't have to put it in a cart, push it to my car, transfer it from the car to the kitchen. Came right to my front door. Thanks Amazon for such great service."
"It looked thick in the picture, but the bottom of this has no padding at all, my greyhound won't even lay on it. waste of money."
"My 10 month old Great Dane puppy loved it for about 3 weeks, then figured out that she could stick her lower jaw in the hole and rip the core out by holding the rest of the cube with her paws. I don't know if a smaller dog could have pulled that off, but once she got the core out the whole thing was ruined within a minute."
"My rats love this stuff. I give them each a little when I take them out of the house, whether it be for a checkup with the vet, or a visit to a friends house. They can get a little stressed in new environments which can lead to them getting sick.I find that this product has two effects.#1 It keeps my rats happy. They Love how it tastes.#2 It helps them to a certain degree with not getting stress related illness that they usually get, when I don't use this."
"As I dog trainer I highly recommend this collar for walking your dog without pulling. It works instantly. I even recommend it in my book. I really love the gentle leader because it helps people with even the strongest pullers. I've seen many clients not be able to walk their large dog and when introduced properly to this collar they could walk them right away. After all, my motto is"
Easy to use. Seems to work. This is what the vet has always given us for worm prevention. This is what we'll stick to.
"The first time I gave this treat to my dog, she spent about six straight hours trying to get the treat out, and finally I took it away so she would leave it alone. It lasted this way for a couple of days before she finally won. I found that it lasts better with only one disc in at a time, as she got through both discs in less time than it took for the first one (it comes loaded with one disc). I will be keeping refills on hand."
"My eleven month old pit bull loves to rip apart stuffed dog toys to get at the squeaker, and sadly this toy didn't last too much longer than the others. She got the squeaker out in about an hour (vs. the usual fifteen minutes), so it didn't really work. It does have less stuffing which is nice, and the seams are a bit better, but if your dog is as tenacious and strong as mine, she'll shred it in no time."
Very well made. Perfect for keeping my cat my cat from waking me up at 3am. Plus it is Made In The USA as a bonus.
The gate is cheap. Disappointed with my purchase. It falls apart every time you remove it from the doorway and has a very cheap feel to it. Don't buy this brand unless it is the only thing you can afford. It works as a gate when assembled but you will struggle with putting it in or removing from doorways. Not anything like I expected from my use of other gates of this style.
"I love the furmiator. My dog get one of the thickest winter coats which takes a long time to come out and ends up all over the house with me vacuuming several times a week. In about 30 minutes time, I can get rid of most of this. I let my mom borrow it and she never gave it back...LOL so I ordered another one for this season.I highly recommend this!"
This is a great addition to our car trips and my dog loves it. He jumps right in once in the car and then sleeps. The harness keeps him tethered to the seat belt and he has enough room (18 pounds) to sleep in many different directions.
"(Cross-posting from my review on the cartridge refills)I used the Litter Locker and refills for a few years faithfully, buying the refill cartridges in bulk to keep the costs down (""only"" $6 per cartridge, each lasting roughly a month for 2 cats). In a small apartment it really did help cut down on the smell, despite the flimsy plastic construction. I never used the plastic scooper, due to it clogging and getting scratched and harboring bacteria, but I was able to keep a metal scoop in the holder.About a year ago, I started feeling Green Guilt about this product! I wasn't entirely sure that my local recycling plant took this shape of plastic to recycle, so the cartridges may have just ended up in the landfill after all. Plus it takes a certain amount of energy to make the cartridges and ship them in the first place. It just didn't seem like the greenest option. We donated the Litter Locker and, for the moment, are using an old litter bucket with a lid and cheap garbage bags inside. This cuts down on the smell reasonably well and the cost to the environment and to my pocket book is less than the Litter Locker. After this box of garbage bags runs out I may even spend the extra money to buy biodegradable bags, which will be the same price of 1 cartridge and will last much longer.Our current living situation is such that we can have our litter box outside on a screened-in porch. We may have to re-evaluate when we have less space to hold the litter box, the bucket with used litter, and the bucket with fresh litter (which we refill rather than buy new buckets). Maybe by then there will be a new, less wasteful product available."
"I just about gave up trying to find a treat that Prowler, my orange tabby would eat. She loves peanut butter licked off my finger, and small amounts of dairy products (she'll try to steal ice cream out of a bowl, if I'd let her). I've tried almost every brand, then my new girlfriend mentioned Feline Greenies. I thought, ""Naaa...she won't eat those either."" Wrong! She looks forward to her Greenies every morning. If she doesn't get them, there's no peace in the house until she gets them. We give her and my tuxedo cat, Obie, 6 each morning. They disappear quickly. And they're good for the teeth, too. I'm totally sold on them and it looks like they're going to get their 6 each morning for the rest of their lives :-)"
"Instead of buying the expensive plastic trash containers, put in a grocery bag. It will save you money and time."
"It is a tad smaller on all sides making it not fit snuggly in the bottom of my kennel. According to the photo, I assumed it'd have a little more of a lip on the sides as well. Overall not happy but I guess it's serving it's purpose."
After purchasing three automatic litter boxes from another company - all of which broke down in a short time - I purchased a Scoop Free litter box. What a difference. There is virtually no odor. The motor is adequate for the job it has to do and is reasonably quiet. The cartridges are expensive but worth every penny. I am so grateful for this product and hope I have not jinxed myself by saying how great it is.
"It only took 2 bottles to notice a huge difference in my German Sheperds teeth. They had alot of build up and we have always brushed his teeth, and hes a huge toy chewer, but this did the trick along with the spray at night! I would highly recommend this product ."
"The bags are sturdy, however, are small when trying to tie them closed. I have to carry another bag, such as one that comes with the newspaper, to carry the Bags on Board, as I can't carry the short-handled bags easily once they are used. It would be helpful if the bags were sold by the dog's weight."
"Easy order, prompt delivery and good price. Overall - a no hassle transaction! However, do not expect this heater to keep your small tank properly at temp if your house or area you have your tank is 65-70 degrees."
Dogs don't mind the paste. Must be okay then. Dogs don't mind the paste. Must be okay then. Dogs don't mind the paste. Must be okay then.
"I ordered one of these for my dog, who does not chew his toys - he mouths them a little bit, but never rips or tears them. Mr. Bill is hilarious - when you squeeze him, he says ""Ohhhhhhhh Nooooooo!"" A fun change from all the toys we have that squeak.This toy does not appear to be made to stand up to much chewing, so if your dog likes to rip toys apart, either buy this when the price is really low, or skip it and look for something more sturdy. It has lots of pieces that would be easy for a dog to grab and rip off. An aggressive chewer could probably destroy it in seconds.It is also a nice medium size, so small dogs or large ones could play with it."
"I have a large, very aggressive chewer (chocolate lab). I've had pretty good luck with two other nylabone products, but they were a bit small and I figured it was time to bring out the big gun. With all these bones I believe it's time to retire them when small chunks start coming off of them; this bone did not last long before this started happening. By contrast the other nylabones lasted much longer, but based on price and advertised qualities it should have been the other way around.So this was a lot of money for a product that lasted less than a month. The search continues but I'll be looking at products made by other companies a bit harder now. I regret not buying this locally as I would have marched back into the store with this bone."
i love these treats! Great for training and super great price. they just seem to last forever there are so many in the bag.
"Product worked as advertised. Just make sure you order the right size. I have a brussell Griffon, who's a little over weight (18 lbs). It just cleared his head, once it's on, you can &#34;set it n' for get it.&#34;"
"I bought this collar for my 18 month old Pit Bull, Morticia, about 3-4 weeks ago.30 years of owning Pit Bulls, they were always quiet and hardly ever barked, so it was never an issue. Now that my neighbors behind us and next to them have dogs, things have changed. The barking is incessant and my dog likes to run out the back door to join them in the gossip. We blocked the doggie door but it didn't stop her from barking in the house or getting up and barrelling towards it to go outside. Not to mention, not everyone in the house follows the training regimen I set for her.For a couple of months, I pondered getting a collar for her. I was not going to get a shock or vibration collar and &#34;sonic&#34; collars are useless (as per my 20 years experience in the pet trade and people returning them constantly). I had a customer years ago (who was a trainer) that used the spray collars on a couple of Pits she was working with, albeit they were the remote collars, but they worked. And left a refreshing citrous scent in their wake.When I first put the collar on my dog, it went off immediately with no reason. She ran and hid behind the couch. I coaxed her out and adjusted the collar. She turned her head and it went off again. She hid under her bed. More adjustments. And to my luck, there were no triggers for her barking for 3 hours to actually test the collar. I tried Animal Planet and NatGeo channels with hopes there would be barking dogs. The neighbors dogs weren't barking. Nothing. Finally, someone's dog barked and she responded. The collar sprayed and she was back in the house and hiding. A couple more incidents and more adjustments, the collar only goes off if she barks or growls too loud.At this point, she doesn't bother to go outside if the other dogs are barking or comes back in if they start. She's not making the mad dash through the house and out the back at every sound. She's happy. Now, more often than not, the collar is turned off or not even on her. Sometimes she figures it out and I put the collar on, but the barking is manageable now. She hasn't associated the collar with the spray--she's actually thrilled when she sees it. And another perk is that one of my Bostons is old and getting ornary. Once in a while, he attacks her. The altercations are over before they start because the collar sprays and neutralizes the situation. He's been sprayed in the face with no ill effects, so it's not like mace. A couple of sneezes and everything is fine.Now about the collar itself. PetSafe/Innotek have always made quality products so I had no doubts about that. The spray tank ran dry after the first week. Since it hardly goes off now, I just top it off every week or so just in case. I can't attest to the battery yet because it hasn't run down. But I will say so far the life is good and I've read reviews where people change them once every few months with continuous use. The collar is a basic nylon strap with a plastic quick connect buckle -- no complaints there. It can be cut down to size and I even tried it on my Boston. The only problem on a small dog is that the unit is a bit unwieldly and large for them, but smaller units are made for the little guys.After the first day with the collar misfires, I had my doubts. I was even going to send it to PetSafe for a replacement or put it up on eBay. For those having problems with the random spraying issue, make sure the collar is properly adjusted. It took a couple of days to get it right and now random sprays are no longer a problem. Morticia likes to roll around on the carpet and the unit moves to the back of her neck. Once she gets up and shakes herself out, it slides back down into position. I will, however, pick up a can of the unscented spray because the citronella makes my mother sneeze when it goes off.So all in all, this collar was an excellent investment and I reccomend it to anyone with problem barkers."
Within 1 week my fish pond was clearing up. A great product to use to prevent string algae from growing in your pond. Safe and does not harm fish or plant life.
"Our little poodle ""Joey"" loves this toy. I love the way you can regulate the dispensing of his kibble. He is quite the chewer and after reading some reviews concerning that I was hesitant to order it. I figured for the price it was worth a try. I am so glad I did because he hasn't made even a dent in his and it adds interest for him to figure out another type toy and how to get into those treats! Pretty cute to watch. I even ordered another one to have on deck whenever he does start chewing up this one."
"Hv deleted previous feedback about this digital thermometer because I've used them and now understand why theres so many diverse opinions. ""Let the buyer Beware! Check it out against a different thermometer first to find out how accurate your unit is before relying on it with your fishes' life. True, one shldn't hv to do this but is your dead fish worth it? I only use mine as a guideline and both of them I bought work great for my needs, I'm assuming their accurate since I hvn't had any adverse effects yet. I give the Digital Thermometer's a five star rating!"
"The carbon filter handles the smell very well and the ""stairs"" that kitty must descend to exit the box get the majority of the litter out of her paws. I have small litter mat in front (which my kitty has to walk on since there is only one entrance and exit) that seems to catch the minimal amount of litter (if there is any) still left in her paws.Update (11/2/12) - Still have this product and still pleased with it. The carbon filters are easy to find and do a great job of controlling any odor. Another key to success I've found is keeping the ""stairs"" litter free. We keep and old dust buster by the litter box for this purpose. We have NO litter on the floor around the box with this product, as it does a great job of containing it. We do give it a thorough cleaning often by dumping all litter, scrubbing it with a vinegar and baking soda combo, and rinsing it (usually with a hose in the driveway). It still looks like the day we purchased it. Very good product!"
Coat looks great and fit well. Think it is agreat buy. Would recommend it for any dog going out on a cold night.
Fits my middy dachshund very well! Not at all too large for him. HE LIKES it! Only possible problem is that it is bulky and takes alot of room in the car. But we like it very much!
"I have 2 male cats (one is 10 lbs, the other a whopping 20 lbs). Before I bought the Scoop Free Self-Cleaning Litter Box, I had to scoop at least once a day, sometimes twice. Now, I only have to mess with the litter box about every week and a half. The packaging says one cartridge can last 2 cats up to 15 days, but mine starts to get a little gross by about 11 days.Even though the cartridges are pricey, it's so nice not dealing with it everyday! I think the extra cost is worth the convenience.It's not my kitties' favorite litter box (I still keep a box on our balcony w/clumping litter for when they are lounging out there). I think the crystal litter is still strange to them. If I had to do it over again, I'd transition them over to crystal litter first, and then set up the Scoop Free. Regardless, it's still worked out great for me!I definitely recommend getting the hood and carpet too. They definitely keep the little crystals from going everywhere (alleviating another former task of sweeping/vacuuming everyday). The hood does seem a little low for my larger cat, but he adapts pretty well.I would give this five stars, except my cartridges only last 11 days or so, and every once in a while poop gets stuck behind the rake. I just slip a plastic baggie over my hand and toss it in front of the rake for the next time it sweeps. Sure it's gross, but it's a lot less gross than scooping everyday.If you don't mind paying extra for convenience, and your cats adapt pretty well to new situations, I highly recommend it.It also does do a very good job of containing the smell. Just in case kitty leaves a particularly smelly deposit, you can push the button and it will rake sooner than the 20 minutes that are programmed. Also, a sticking an air freshener on top of the hood helps, and I also recommend Febreze Air Effects Pet Odor Eliminator."
Our poodle loves these things and gets very upset if we run out. They keep her teeth nice and clean too. Shipped promptly. Better price than local stores.
I an on my second bag of these treats. My dog loves them. I cut them in half and the bag lasts longer. My dog will do all three of the tricks that he knows to get one of these treats.
"Our kitten completely refused to take water bath after her third bath, so we have been trying to look for alternatives. My review for this product is that it smells subtly soft and nice. As my kitty always look clean, I cannot tell a huge difference but her fur looks fluffier and smooth after I brushed it when the form dried, the nice smell just makes me want to hug her even more. I've tried the dry powder product but don't really like it due to the power fall off everywhere. I think this one is a winner and I highly recommend it for now unless there will be better product comes to the market. We wipe our kitten once to twice a day with baby wipe and hair brush and will be using this product on a weekly/fortnightly basis for more thorough clean, think the combination will be a good enough alternative to water bath our kitten.Just some addition info to share with other cat owners, I think most cats would not sit still when we apply anything on their body, if that's the case we need to find ways to divert their focus away. When we were applying the form on our kitty, I carry her in my one arm like I usually do, with the other hand initially rubbing her body without the form, then my partner squeezed the form in the hand I used to rub the kitty when our kitty looked away, then I continue to rub her, to avoid our kitten from licking straight after the application, I quickly play with her with her favourite bouncing miceshe was purring during the entire process =)"
"We recently got 2 puppies, I purchased 2 and set these up as a kennel for them. The caps on the sticks that hold the sections together pop off very easily. I had to glue them on so they do not end up falling off and getting eaten. It would also be helpful if they could be sectioned off when linked with a 2nd pen. Otherwise, it does it's job and is a convenient way to keep the puppies safe when we are not at home."
I have three indoor only cats. We have never had fleas until very recently when the area around our complex's dumpster got infested. The fleas must have hitch hiked on my ankles because my townhouse is now completely infested with them. I bought the Frontline to use in conjunction with the $100+ spent on spraying the house and yard top to bottom and all the smelly shampoos. Sad to say the fleas are still sucking my cats dry. Just shampooed one of my cats 3 weeks after applying and I counted at least 40 fleas in various stages of development. Won't be using Frontline again.
"Not only is it a healthy dog food, my two dogs enjoy it. I'm glad I came across this product."
"The pet feeder works just like I need. Now my cats can be fed without worrying about them eating all the food at once. It is nice and simple all with a low cost.The only negative is that you must remove the battery after every use. The timers never stop turning, so if you leave the battery in it goes back to 48 hours from 0. Still worth the money."
"Product did not pro form the way it was suppose to. It must have been defective.because I now know that I am not the only one that had a problem with this product.',,,,,,,,,BBW"
I bought this for my sister's puppy along with the Kyjen Hide-A-Bird to keep him busy while she is gone at work all day. These two toys have curbed his distructive behavior!
"Love these scratching boards. They fit into the Turbo scratcher by Bergen, which is our cats ' favorite toy. We love to put catnip in the Turbo and watch them scratch and rub themselves all over it. During the day, they use the Turbo as a scratching post. Highly recommended."
the furminator is so awesome. it picks up so much hair off our dog. I would recommend this item to anyone.
Angels' eyes really works. I have a Maltese puppy who had a bad tearing stains. I cut the stained hair away. Within a couple of weeks no more stains. I have recommended it to others who have had the same problem.
"Our vet said we could try it for dogs that are aggressive toward each other; it didn't work at all for that, but I don't think that is the collar's issue, just bad advice from the vet; obviously the aggression is not caused by anxiety, so it didn't work. If you receive the same advice, don't bother trying this route."
This has been so helpful in training my puppy. The one downside is that the batteries do not last all that long.
"I really like this coat. My dog, a lab/rhodesian ridgeback, comes running up to me, turns around and waits as I put her coat on her before she goes out when its cold and snowy here in KC. It also works well as a raincoat if it isn't raining really really had. Just totally happy with the coat."
I didn't notice any differenc. The cats still fight and yowl. I put one upstairs and one down and that should cover the whole house.
"Brilliant Pet, the company that makes this product CLAIMS"
"My vet strongly recommended (actually former vet) but his price was exactly DOUBLE what I purchased it for from Amazon. I've used canine joint supplements prophylactically for all my pups beginning at one year. My oldest, an eleven year old Chinook has arthritis and has had bilateral knee repairs.There are so many canine joint health supplements to choose from but the Nutramax folks have been in this business for a long time, have good science behind their formula and are universally respected and trusted in the vet community."
"Very good quality bowl and nice colors, but it was much bigger than I expected (I should have looked at a ruler to see how big 9.5 inches is) and the blue color makes it hard to tell if the bowl is empty."
"This is an awesome product that u should use along an awesome filter, Rena XP1/2/3/4 filters are the best on fish/turtles tank maintenance.They help u keep it clean and healthy to your pets.The Api Bio-Chem Zorb will do as product describes.Cons? really its hard to tell when its death, but the box already says 2 months, for me 1 bag on a 120gl tank with 16goldfishes, the bag last long about 2-3 months.Ill recommend this and other Rena products."
"I have used this poduct for over 10 years and it still gets the job done. I use if for any kind of pest. I even use it in my car to make sure the fleas that hitch a ride on my dogs, don't live for long. It doesn't smell when it's dry and doesn't leave marks on the furniture. It's great."
"Hi, my dog had a TPLO surgery, and her extremely experienced surgeon said that he had contributed to studies at Cornell Vet School on supplements like Cosequin DS, and that this brand is the best; so we have been using it for a couple years and the dogs are doing great. My vet-office sells what they call a `large' bottle, but it is not as big as this one, and costs more! So this is a great deal."
"When I first purchased this gate I loved it! I was able to keep my dog out of the living room where he had previosly urinated on an extension cord that caught fire (luckily I was home and was able to put it out)There was a small gap where the latch closed the gate. I thought no biggie until the next day when I went out shopping and came back 3 hrs.later to find my 12lb Pomeranian dangling from his back leg. Apparently he must have seen the cat jump over the gate and decided he can do it too.Although it has a cat door I couldnt keep it open because he could easily fit through it. He looked dead because he had went into shock. I had to rush him to the emergency room where they did x-rays, blood work etc. I wound up spending over 1000.00 dollars in the vet bill.I am too terrified to even think about purchasing the tall version of this gate.Never in a million years would I have thought he would be able to jump over it.So PLEASE as an animal lover I beg you if you have a small dog DO NOT PURCHASE this gate. If you must go for the taller version."
"I wish we had the option for ZERO STARS! This item deserves ero stars as it is not worth the money. It would not be worth it even if it was under $10! I purchased the Mega box in February 2005 as a gift for my cat at tax time. I was hoping the reduce the amount of cleaning we do to a few times a week and save money on litters & supplies. Well, it worked great up until last September 2005. Now it frequently jams while trying to rack the waste to the recepticle. I spent about $200 on this and it did not last a year. I find that this is a waste of money. I am now replacing the Mega Box with the old fashion litterbox. After reading so many complaints on this machine, I strongly advise that you give up on this path and stick with the standard box. It will save you time and aggrivation even though you have to scoop out the box yourself."
"I used this supplement on my 150lb Rottie (RIP Jack). He had both ACLs repaired, one meniuscus removed, and he ruptured his achilles tendon. He had been on Rimadyl, Deramaxx, narcotics, we went through acupuncture and chiropractic and then I found this supplement.All of the sudden he was my normal boy again. It took maybe a week to 10 days to notice the difference, but he was RUNNING again chasing my other dog. He was not crying when he was sitting or standing up. Gods, I miss him; he was my heart. However, the Boxer/Pit mix (which was his life buddy) is now developing hip soreness and I am going to put both her and my greyhound on this supplement.The drugs are so hard on their systems. They are tough on their liver, if you use prednisone, then they eat and drink more (thus piddle A LOT more), and the word is still out on the Cox-2 inhibitors (Deramaxx).I wont use drugs if I can help it, especially on my seniors. My Jack died because I vaccinated him at 9 years old and I will never do that again. At least before he got ill, he was active and playful and I will carry those memories forever."
"This is one of the best items that I have ever purchased for my cats. The indoor cats love the ""magic"" heat it provides when tucked away beneath towels or blankets. My permanent, outdoor stray cats love them too ((tucked under old towels) especially when it's really cold, windy, and rainy. I have purchased several of the disks over the years and they are durable for a multi-year period, as the manufacturer advertises. I also like them because I only need to heat the disks in the microwave oven twice a day. When the weather is cool, but not COLD, I usually only heat the disks for about 1 1/2 minutes and the heat still lasts for several hours. To me it's a plus that I don't have to leave anything plugged in to keep the pad warm. I highly recommend it - so do my cats!"
"My cats love this. They figured out how it works in about five minutes. It's fairly easy to install, if you are handy and careful. I was sloppy on my first attempt and had to do it again. Great for the summer. It isn't ultra-secure, but it closes firmly and provides decent protection against strays and other animals. My cats are spoiled and won't wear collars so the radio systems other pet doors use wasn't possible for me. For the price you can't go wrong. Now I need to figure out how to get something similar installed on my storm window for the winter."
"I have an 11 month old lab, 90 lb. Large is too small, ex-large too big. Now she can get out of it. I just hope the ex-large doesn't become too small..."
"The liners say that they are for an extra large booda dome litter box, but they are definitely too small. therefore, completely useless."
"I purchased this filter to replace a AQEN POWER FILTER 30which was a pretty good filter but required a media cartridge and I needed to customize my media. With this Aquaclear I'm able to customize my media the way I WANT IT (double sponges, double biomax, etc). First off, this filter is extremely quiet...so quiet in fact I miss the ""waterfall"" sound my previous filter made. Quiet is good an I'm not complaining, trust me. This filter is POWERFUL and keeps my 29G tank CRYSTAL CLEAR...seriously! I use 1 sponge, 1 media bag withDiamond Blend Premium Carbon-Ammonia Neutralizing Blend 23 oz. (652g)and 1 media bag with biomax and my fish and I love it. This filter also has a flow adjustment to control how much water is returned to the tank. This is great if you have delicate fish and the water current needs to be a little softer or if you like to slow the rate of return while feeding (like I do). This is a great filter and I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing a filter that DOES THE JOB!"
Does not interest cat these reviews should be set up so one could write just a few words but they force one to waste ur time.
Scent in product weakened since prior use.Scent did not stay past 2 days and suppose to stay for at least 2 weeks.
The ribbit is exceptionally loud the toy is fairly durable at least as durable as stuffed toys go. My dogs love it so I am pleased.
"We've been using the Cat Mate for over a year and so far it has performed flawlessly. Best of all, our Siamese cat (and you know how finicky cats are) adjusted to using it right away.We use it only when we are going to be away for 24 hours or less (our cat likes to be fed about every 8 hours). I normally place canned food in the first two trays (the ice packs keep it fresh for at least 16 hours) then, if needed, I place dry food in the remaining trays.We haven't had any of the problems others have cited (e.g., dislodged battery, failure of lid to rotate/open etc.). I admit I was skeptical at first, but I've been very pleased at how well this has worked.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, but you have to know your cat. If a cat is particularly rough or aggressive maybe it would be easy to dislodge the batter, but so far we haven't had that problem.I also am careful to be sure the battery is fresh. This is probably over kill, but I always put in a fresh battery each time I use this product.The bottom line is that for us it has worked beautifully."
"He loves these. They smell very chicken-y, presumably taste good to him since he goes insane for them and then ferrets them away into his octo-bed."
That's what my cat turns into when I get this toy out; he bounces on his hind legs.
"I have used this food for 3 months, and at first I thought it was great. But have since taken all my dogs off of it. Their coats are dry and have bad hair loss. Some dogs it is hard to keep weight on them with this food."
My &#34;Kat&#34; love to sharpen up on this and he also sits on top of it! very sturdy and not unatractive.
"Fits perfectly, performs well, provides adequate rain protection for my kennel. This keeps my dogs dry from the elements when it rains."
"The two cats, a young adolescent boy, and a grown young lady, really love this tunnel. They place chase, they go in there to sleep, its used probably at least once a day or more often by one of them or both. My funloving, slightly hyper young male enjoys teasing the dog and playing a sort of hide-and-go-seek with her. Of course, being a cat, he gets her extremely confused and with a great ""DUH!"" expression on her face as she fails to follow the ultra high speed moving cat around and through the tunnels and up, over, down, through, around all the furniture in the house.We've had the original tunnel for about as long as we've had the boy cat, and so eventually I went back to Amazon and bought the connecting T-piece (Pet Supply Imports - Kitty Connector Tees) and another tunnel. With that, we can tie it literally in a circle or in a v-shape, its much more fun for them.With all the months and all the heavy usage I will say the circular ""ribs"" which hold up the tunnel have taken a beating. About once a day I have to sort of shake the whole thing out---toys and all--to help them stand upright again as they otherwise tend to be sort of collapsed now. My other problem---it says its washable, well, ha! Let me see the maker clean the soft white batting type material on the inside of the tunnels!! The outside part, it is true, could be wiped down, but its the inside which by now--at least 8 months of heavy use---is looking pretty dingy. The cats, of course, don't care.At some future point when these tunnels are beyond all human help, I'll get two more, and perhaps another tee. It is one of the more expensive toys (after their cat condo), but as with the condo, worth hundreds of little toys they don't look at twice. As completely indoor cats, I feel a responsibility to provide them with at least some of the fun, and things to do, they'd find in the countryside, where my childhood cats lived."
This tool works great on my Standard Poodle even tho they do not shed. It gets the tiny fuzz out that can cause matting very well. Best of all she likes it because it is gentle on her skin. Thank you Amazon for offing this great deal with no shipping cost to me! I am very happy!
I absolutely love this toy. It gives my dogs hours of fun.I bought the first one a few years ago for one of my mother's dogs. To this day she still plays with it and enjoys herself everytime.The whole thing is extremely durable. As I stated I bought this a few years ago and it still looks great.I love this toy so much that when I adopted my dog I ran out and bought her the hide-a-squirrel.
"I am conflicted regarding this product. On one hand, it works exactly as described"
"I have two long haired dachshunds, one of which has A LOT Of fur. She regularly gets mats behind her ears and on her legs. I used to simply use scissors to cut out the mats that I couldn't pull apart, but this is a much better alternative. I used my mom-in-law's once and had to buy one for myself.It combs through mats much more easily, and does not result in missing chunks of fur. If a mat is simply too large for me to comb through, I can use the teeth to ""saw"" through the mat to get it out.One caution"
"I've been using the TurboScratcher since it came out in the early 80s as a toy and scratching item for my cats. I have NEVER paid for than about $12-13 for it, and the inserts used to be available from WalMart for 3/$9. The catnip helps get the attention for the scratching part, and once the see how much fun it is to scratch, they rarely go back to carpet or furniture. I've had more than one cat that never ONCE went for furniture because I made sure he/she had her own turbo-scratcher from the moment they arrived in my house. I have one that is a light blue from back in the 80s when everything was light blue and mauve. If left in the sun a bit too long, they do tend to get a little brittle, but while they feel a little flimsy, they are perfect for the cats. For those without carpet -- use the rubber shelf or drawer liner cut in a square or circle a couple of inches bigger than the whole toy and it doesn't move at all. I have never had any problem on any surface until I recently moved into a house with handscraped hardwood floors that are uneven. This trick worked wonders there and I suspect it would have been more stable on the tile floor in our last house as well, but our cat like to sleep on it in the window in the sun just as much as playing or scratching it. I recommend one to any cat that I adopt out at rescue, and for my foster babies, I give one to the family that adopts them because that's what I teach them to scratch on and I don't want them developing bad habits of scratching furniture or carpet in their new home -- where they are often trying to cope with the unfamiliar. I've been told by my adoptive families that this was a really great thing to send esp since it was familiar and they were surprised at how much it was used. Before replacing the cardboard circle, make sure you turn it over and use both sides! if they seem a little bored and you are out of catnip, just pic up a little bag of it and it will totally get their attention again."
"There's nothing wrong with the mat. It arrived quickly, just as pictured, but my cats did not like it. I don't know if it really is ""warming"" (seems like an ordinary padded mat), but it does rustle, and my cats didn't seem to appreciate it. Yours could like it though--not all cats like the same things. Will try again with an enclosed cat bed."
If your bird likes chewing on things you should give this toy a shot. The individual blocks are very very soft wood that even a small bird can have a good time with and at this price it's a easy gamble to see if your bird will like it.
"The collar is absolutely adorable. The dog was slightly annoyed by it. The jiggle bells are nice and aren't to load, so its not to bad listening to your dog walk around"
I bought this product about 3 1/2 weeks ago for my dog who has a dull coat and chronic shedding problem. Within three weeks I noticed his coat was much shinier and he is shedding about 80% less. It took 2-3 days for him to decide he liked the taste but luckily he is food driven so I didn't have to fight him about it. My elderly 13 year old dog didn't need it but when she started trying to eat his food because of the oil I decided to give it to her also. That was about a week ago so we'll see what it does for her coat. I would definitely recommend this product.
recommend this product to all dog lovers. have been using this product for 5 years. hard time finding for a good price.
"I ordered the Medium kennel for my 28lb Sheltie. It was very easy to put together and is lightweight. We use it for traveling, and have a much larger metal crate for the house. This size is just big enough for him to lay down and turn around as needed, and fits in the back seat of my Altima. These kennels are very durable as well, and fairly good quality. Definitely a must have for any traveling dog!"
"My cat has (unfortunately) been in this collar since january...I hate to put her in a new one, but the strings are getting a big rough around the edges..however, she does not mind this collar at all...gets in and out of the litter box, eats, grooms (excpet where she is not supposed too!) and plays with her brother cat without an issue...highly recommended! she would have never survived the ""cone"" type collar.."
It worked right away. I have two dogs about 70lbs each. It worked the first day. They bark very little when on. The citronella collar was recommended by my Vet.
"I owned this box for two days. I was really excited to buy the product after reading these reviews but it was a failure from the beginning. In the first few turns it was shoving litter around so that 1/4 of the box was bare at all times (even when I tried to fix it by putting in more litter). Then it made a clumpy mess of the litter that was small pieces spread all over. Then at some point it just stopped turning. It was still plugged in and the green indicator light was on but it was dead. When I cleaned it out to return it it appeared some litter had jammed it at the base of the conveyer ramp but it was a very small amount that should not be able to cause a jam. In the end I found only one small piece of litter that ever made it to the disposal part. I carefully followed all directions and used a premium litter. I am not sure if my unit was defective but I was so frustrated I decided I'd rather get my money back and go back to the old box. I do have to say that my unit, for the short time it worked, was never loud (I could barely hear it). I have to agree with the comments that they should offer a top for it, my kitten threw litter all over the place since the sides are so low."
"I love this pen! Its big enough that my little fur baby has room to play, but it can also be folded in so that it takes up less space while in use. It can be used indoor and out and its tall enought she cant jump over."
"HAVE USED ON MY DOGS FOR THE PAST 2 1/2 YEARS,NO FLEAS OR TICKS ON THEM OR IN MY HOUSE. THEY ARE OUTSIDE FREQUENTLY AND WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY LOTS OF TREES AND WOODS. I USE ALL YEAR ROUND AND WILL CONTINUE TO FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE DOGS!! EXPENSIVE-YES BUT WORTH IT!"
"The Gentle Leader is an excellent dog product! My dog, a Labrador Retriever who weighs 70 pounds, is strong. This product keeps him from pulling because, when he tries to pull, it pulls his head at the same time. Dogs can't pull when their heads are being tugged. Obviously, my dog isn't crazy about the Gentle Leader, but I am!"
"Finally, a dog treat my dog loves and consumes - historically she just carries similar chews around and ultimately I find them in the yard (sometimes buried, sometimes just in a pile). These sticks are more of treat for her than a typical long-lasting rawhide chew - which is fine with me. My dog (a mini Aussie mix of about 48bls) gobbles a chew in a few minutes and seems quite satisfied with her ""you just got home, where's my treat?"" chew. My dog's vet said these were fine in moderation - the dog is happy, the vet is content and I'm both :)UPDATE"
"***UPDATE***It's been four months since I received this product. The hose has cracked and broken in four different spots. They could easily have turned hazardous for any pets. It could be fixed easily by going and buying some new hose, but I don't think it's worth it. The bubbling seems like a good idea at first, but to be honest I do not think it makes any difference. The dogs didn't drink any more and the water wouldn't have really been any cleaner since I still refilled it and cleaned it almost every day. That being said... I will still continue to use it. Just with no bubbles. I took the hose out and it is now just a normal waterer. If I could I would bump it down to 3/5 stars. I would still recommend it to people because it is about the same price as any of the normal water bowls that have a jug over them. It's very stable. I have two rottweilers and they never managed to knock it over. It also holds a good amount of water.I decided on this instead of a normal watering thing because of the bubbles. The one I got puts out a pretty decent amount of air bubbles. The pump is not loud at all. I don't know why some reviews said it was... I have two rottweilers and they both took to it pretty quickly. At first they were a little bit apprehensive about the pump and bubbles, but within a few hours they are drinking out of it fine. Every time they go near it and sniff around or drink I have been praising them. It is also very easy to clean. My only complaint is that the pump has to go behind it. I think it would have been better if they had put a little compartment underneath the water tank. Overall I think it is a good product and I would recommend it to most people."
My noble does like this food..she is very picky..for the price I am happy with it..I do switch off and on with other foods..but she seems to like this one best..good quality good price..good company to purchase from..I think you should try it if your bird is picky too..
"After having bills for teeth cleaning for pets, I made up my mind the next pet I got, I would start them off right so they wouldn't have to be put under to have their teeth cleaned and I wouldn't have a huge bill!Recently got a great new shelter dog and did what I said, I decided to start him right off cleaning his teeth! So got this and tried today. As advised, I put a bit of the toothpaste on my finger and let my dog taste it. Then I put a bit on the toothbrush and proceeded to brush a few of his teeth, taking it slowly. Eventually I got to all of them and he didn't seem to mind at all. There is also a little gum massager one can use for puppies. I used that on my adult dog to try to reach some of his back teeth. Overall very happy with this product because my dog doesn't fight me, but seems to like it!"
We blended this new food in with our Lab's old food for a couple weeks before switching all the way. His digestive system took about a month to adjust to it. We were worried for a few days... but then he adjusted & now loves it. Just ordered our second bag. So much easier having it delivered to our door step!
"I bought this in hopes of soothing our little yorkie-poos dry, flaky skin in the winter and man am I glad I did! Wonderful product, smells great and when used with the fur butter provides and very thorough relief for pets who are constantly itching."
"I bought this for my baby lab puppy and mercy, he only used it the first week we brought him home. It is super small and he quickly fished out the squeaky on the inside. I ended up giving this to a friend with a cairn terrier puppy - probably a much better fit! This is smaller than the palm of my hand!!!"
"This cage is well worth the price I paid for it. It is pretty strong, but probably shouldn't be used for a large or particularly destructive parrot. It is nice and spacious for my tiny parrotlet, and would also accommodate one or two of the medium parrots like cockatiels or conures nicely. I have a feeling I'm going to have it for quite a long time. :)"
"I was a little leery about the product, but we haven't had any problems so far. I was surprised how fast they were sent."
"Bought this pack to try since my dog has a fussy system when it comes to some flavors of treats. He doesn't get them every day, hasn't had any adverse reaction and is happy when he does get one. Doesn't last long but that's not what it's intended for."
This is by far the best made feeder we have found. We have three rotties and they all have their own feeder. One of our feeders is over six years old and it still looks band new. The raised feeder makes it easier for them to eat.
These are a nice alternative to a Kong. You can adjust how fast the treats come out which is great for many dogs. They also bounce and roll great!!
"I have to agree with other reviewers. The odor control and clumpability of this product leave a lot to be desired, especially in the corners of the box. If I fail to clean the box out for a day, the corners become super-saturated because that's where my cat prefers to winky tink, and it stinks to high heaven.The litter itself is unfragranced, which is absolutely essential as the fragranced products give me a migraine. I've switched to the unfragranced Multi-Cat Arm & Hammer litter. It controls odors a lot better without adding an obnoxious odor of its own."
"I'm going to have to purchase Frontline. Still have fleas.Not a good product, will not buy again.xx xxx xxxx"
"Our dog demolished this mat within 24 hours of it bring in his house. The top cover is super flimsy and doesn't stay on. Not something I'd recommend purchasing, unless you have a very small, toothless dog."
"the only thing that works is the alarm, the rest doesnt do anything to dogs the ultrasonic doesnt work at all"
"This is a nice seat belt harness. However if your dog is a heavy chewer, this might not work for you. Our lab/basset hound mix was a HEAVY chewer. He chewed through two of these harnesses! We probably needed a harness made of steel;-)"
"I thought this toy was great. Unfortunately, it lasted about a month. I have a yorkie poo who loves it. It makes the greatest noise but once she got hold of the label, the seam opened and it was over.I wish it had lasted longer. I won't buy another unless there is some kind of warranty. But who would guarantee a dog too? NO ONE"
"I own a pet care company and use my nail trimmers all the time. I had been using the Bamboo trimmers, which I love- but the blades dull...so I thought getting something with a replaceable blade would be great. Unfortunately, these trimmers are flimsy and just disappointing. The cut isn't exact like with my others and it seems to pinch the pet- the animals were showing signs of discomfort. All in all- this would be fine for a smaller dog and just occasional use, but doesn't work at all well for anything much over 40-50 lbs."
"I'm only taking time to write this to let others know that these work very well and cut cleanly. There is a stop plate to prevent cutting the nail too short. I had used the ""guillotine"" style clipper before this and they were terrible by comparison. My dog hated having her nails trimmed and now I think it's because the other clippers were painful. With these clippers I can do it quickly and my dog doesn't seem to mind at all. TL;DR"
Our 15 lb. puppy and his razor teeth chew through every toy. This one is hanging there TOUGH!
I have been buying this product for more than 8 years. My 3 cats jump higher and farther than they did 8+ years ago. I have never seen the price on this unit so low.Terrific product. Recommend to any cat owner whose cats are at least 2 years old. Never too early to start them on this powder.
"I love the design of this bed. I have a very large dog and it suited her size perfectly. However, after only 1 wash and a little use the fabric is coming apart and the material is faded. Also, the stuffing mats very easily. Not a bad bed for the price but wanted it to last longer!"
"My baby hurt his front right leg. I could not lift him up the stairs. This harness was a god-send. As he was recuperating, I needed to lift him up and down the stairs to relieve himself outside.That would not have been possible without this harness. It was so hard to see my best friend have so much trouble. And it was wonderful to be able to help him. He is almost 100% now...and i couldn't be more thrilled."
It is hard to find toys my dog will not break apart but this is one! My tough chewer could play with this for hours if there is a hidden treasure inside. A must for every dog owner who doesn't have the time to play fetch ALL day!
"My dog can destroy ANYTHING!!! Except this ball! He loves chewing on it to his heart's desire and it hasn't punctured, ripped, or even gotten a mark on it. Although it is hard to get treats into/out of so he spends most of his time trying to get them out (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) he doesn't usually get rewarded for his efforts and sometimes gets bored."
"These beds are so nice and plush my dogs just love them. They wash good in the washing machine and dryer and have a nice thick bottom to them, I am very happy!"
"My older puppy figured this one out right away. Roll the ball, get a treat so he was rolling it all over the place. The younger one kept picking it up and shaking it and then she tried to stick her tongue inside to get the treats. We got a good laugh out of it. But from watching the other one she finally got it. But once the treats are gone they don't want it anymore. It is a good toy though. Can't chew it up. Worth the money."
These are a great way to train your puppy to do just about anything you want it to do. They loved these little treats and they are moist and chewy. I buy these all the time for my maltese and would highly recommend them.
"My husband injured his knee and could not lift ""Ruby"" on to the bed. She was very depressed, I am in a wheel chair and could not help. Now she flies up the stairs, coming and going as she pleases. Ruby is a 20 lb, minature daschond mix. One happy dog."
Great product! Our cat loves his new bed. We have it set up in the garage. The heat not only keeps him warm but it also seems to help with his arthritis.
"My Shiba Inu loved the cow until it stopped mooing - it's pretty much lost its' charm for him since then (about three days!) -- I'm going to stick to the stuffed toys with squeakers -- they're cheaper and even when he de-stuffs them, he still looks for them in his toy basket!"
"Bought this from a local pet store to use on a lanai screen. Advertised as being able to install on screen doors or screen panels (as in lanais). Well the directions show someone removing a door and hammering it into place. A little difficult to do if your trying to mount it on a screen panel in a lanai. Two of us working together have not been able to get these pieces to come together. Have a feeling I'm going to end up drilling holes in it and bolting it together. What a joke!*edit* Looking at other reviews, I'm wondering if there was a change in the design. I see references to pins and rubber pieces. What we have is solid plastic where a male plastic channel mates to a female completely around the perimeter. It appears others with a similar design have expressed grief with installing it as well."
This Kitty Condo arrived just as it appears in the picture. My only problem is that it does not have enough weight to it to stay put when my adult cats reach up and try to scratch on the posts. The condo will move and has almost tipped over on my cat a few times. Otherwise it is a great product.
"This carrier was nice to have for the trip home after picking up my bunnies. They were comfortable with a little hay in the bottom and we could peek in at them to make sure they looked like they were doing okay. When I'm not using it to carry the bunnies, I use it to store hay!"
THE DOGS HATE THE STEPS AND WILL NOT USE THEM. PLASTIC FEEL MAKES THEM UNSURE OF THE STEPS AND THEY ARE COLLECTING DUST AS WE SPEAK.
"Like the concept of the box. We really like to use Feline Pine clumping litter. It does not work well at all in this box. The litter, I think, is too light weight. So we are using the box and scooping it out just like a regular litter box. Also the sifting grate comes loose inside the box, which is quite bothersome to fix when their is litter in the box."
"I had to buy the med size for my puggle's 27 lb weight . I love the way she obeys and walks with it. My wife doesn't like the way it looks like a muzzle, but I don't think it does. I think it looks great and I really like the way our dog behaves with other dogs, kids and other distractions around. Great buy and I'd do it again."
"I ordered a small for my yorkie. He weighs about 8 pounds. Love the coat for him, but wish I would have bought the size extra small - look at the sizing chart that is under the ""Product Details,"" would have saved me buying a bit too big (I'm not docking the star rating, as I should have done more research on the sizing). The small is for dogs 10-12 inches from the back of the neck to their bum. So, the coat on his back is perfect for him, but the straps that go under his belly cover up parts that need to be exposed :-). But I just stitched the straps a little, so they sit closer to his front legs, and it is going to work for my dog. Great product, the best little coat (that will keep him the warmest) for a dog I have ever seen."
Our German Shepherd loves these! He carries them around constantly. They hold up a lot longer than your standard tennis ball. One of the few toys that lasts months rather than a few hours.
"tears after a few times, even when I'm trying to be careful. The Clevercat Top Entry box is great, but because the sides are rounded not squared, the scooper has a tendency to rip the liner. (I don't think that would happen if the box were not curved).If you really prefer using a liner, then you'll need to find a special scooper designed for use with liners. Using your normal scooper will not work well."
i ordered this for my two medium size dogs...a german shepherd mix and a yellow lab mix. they are both about 50lbs and it works perfectly for them!!
"My dog has hip problems. Most large dogs eventually do. Her Vet. recommended this product and supplied it to me at twice the cost for half the product size. It worked as she predicted and I have seen substantial relief and greater mobility in my 11 year old puppy. Buy this product, just NOT from you Vet, if your dog is suffering from hip pain. great price on Amazon. The Vet should be ashamed of herself for charging so much."
most clumps form to the side of the box and slightly stick...this method is ridiculous because it would cause clumps to crumble and pieces to be left behind. Its great if our cat only ever forms a clump the whole way around the urination deposit...if you want MORE work and more stink...then this is the box for you
"The item is as described and my puppy learned how to use it quickly. I do not know if it is the product, or that my puppy is really smart, but she got bored really soon, after figuring it out. So, it is a good toy if your dog is not so bright! Mine likes more challenging toys. Also, beware it only works for dry treats, as it would be really hard to open it for cleaning."
"I purchased this along with two extra panels to make the containment area larger. This is the best puppy pen I have ever used. It sets up easily, you can put down potty pads, and a bed area, plus their food and it all stays great. Will definitely recommend to anyone who has puppies!"
"I just received this harness, so I can't attest to its durability (yet), but I felt compelled to write a review. This harness WORKS. Just like the picture of this product, I have a Weimaraner. She's four months old, 37lbs, and a bundle of energy. She loves going for walks and I'm trying to get her better with the leash, but it's hit or miss. Sometimes she's good, but if she gets excited (which she does A LOT), sees another dog, or any random person, she lunges and jumps. She's literally getting stronger by the week and getting harder to control. I can't attach her leash to her collar; she doesn't seem to realize she's choking herself and causing raw marks around her neck. I've tried the head harness, but that was a complete failure from the start. I refuse to put choke chains on my dogs so I began trying harnesses. Even those were giving her rub burns from pulling, even the Kong brand comfort harness. After seeing this and reading the reviews, I decided to try this out. The sizing chart was accurate. The deep purple color matches perfectly with the collar she already has (and, might I say, looks gorgeous on her coat). I had to adjust it to pretty much its smallest size, but that's ok since she's still growing and can grow into this. Putting harnesses on her has always been more a two-person job. She fidgets and bites and can't sit still to save her life. I guess because this harness has only 3 straps instead of the usual 4, it was actually easier to slip on her. She immediately started chewing on the front, even before I clasped it shut. I'm hoping it'll hold up to her chewing; I'll update this later when she's worn it longer. After leaving it on her for 30-some minutes, I decided to take it out for a spin. It IMMEDIATELY had results. She usually pulls and lunges right out the door, and a split second after she tried with this harness on, she felt the pressure of it across her front and stopped. We walked out the front door at a nice calm pace, which she's only ever done when she was half asleep. We got outside and throughout our entire walk there was no pulling. At all. That has literally never happened with her before. As soon as she'd attempt to pull, she'd stop and there were a few times where she'd stop and turn to look at me, like she knew I finally won this battle. Walking with her was an absolute joy. She walked beside me the whole time and didn't try to run off after the neighborhood kids or my neighbors walking their dogs like she usually does. I'll definitely update this after we've had it for another month or so just to give a better review on its durability with a dog who loves to chew, but so far I am absolutely ecstatic over this purchase."
"I bought these soft claws because it seems like a really good idea...Not for my cat, all he has been doing is chewing them off, he is down to four now. I like the idea of these but I wish there were an easier way of getting them on and staying on! Maybe its just my cat...better luck to everyone else. Good product but just not for my cat."
"Pretty decent feeder. Like other reviewers experienced, my cat figured out how to jam his paw into the spout and pry a few pieces out. But he gets bored with it pretty quick, so portion control is still achieved.Only complaint is that it died after a year. I feel that for the price it should have lasted longer."
"You don't want phosphate in your tank, it will create alge.I put this into my filter media and within a week virtually all my alge problems disappeared."
"This product really helped clear up our flea problem last summer. We tried several products before, but our vet recommended this and it really worked! I recommend!"
"My dogs love these durable toys! The only drawback is that the toys are very lifelike, and my German Shepherd-Chow keeps taking them out into the yard to bury them. Too funny."
"I purchased this for my cat and he loved it immediately. It holds quite a bit of water, so you don't have to fill it up very often. However it is very tricky to clean. You have to take it completely apart and there are lots of sharp edges that can cut your fingers while you're cleaning it. The manufacturer recommends cleaning it once a week so be prepared for some cuts and scrapes!"
"When i bought this, my wife was saying i was crazy. She swore that they wouldn't care if it was fresh daily, or always fresh. So, we left the bowl that she filled daily with water out as well. It took the pets about a day to get used to the fountain but, once they did they didn't even touch the water from the bowl.The downside is that it does have a little bit of noise... soft at first but, like a kettles loud whistle to tell you it needs attention. So does this, with an annoying gurgling sound."
"My 8 month old cat loves this toy. He was afraid of it for the first two days. Maybe because he thought it was a real bird. Now he likes it and leaps high into the air to try to catch it. When he does catch it, it's hard to get him to let it go. He's a bit rough on his toys, but fortunately they sell replacement feathers and other things to dangle from it. I'm not sure how long it will last with my rough boy, but so far I'm really happy with how much he enjoys jumping around with it."
"Awesome. Good price. Good quality (you get what you pay for! :D)P.S. It's mostly &#34;All Natural&#34; other than a nice fact brought about by another buyer who had diligently researched the Coconut Extract to be a possible dermatological irritant to folks.If you own a big dog, the bottle might last you no more than a year tops (unless you dilute it with water in a separate bottle)"
"Like the previous reviewer, I am disappointed that the fixture didn't last longer. I will look elsewhere for the replacement."
"I am in love with the Lupine collar. I was afarid at first of the ""quick release"" but I tried so hard to pull it apart. Not like your usual quick release. I can't believe that it has a lifetime gurantee. As long as your pet is in the same size collar it is quranteed. Lupine is worth the money. And the quality is awesome."
"I was hesitant to buy a product like this, but after reading several positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. After two months of usage, I have not noticed any reduction in the plaque levels of my dog's teeth. (See the image I uploaded at the top of this page.) Each day, I add two scoops of the PlaqueOff product to her food. In addition, her teeth are brushed three times per week.Save your money and take your dog to the vet to have his/her teeth professionally cleaned. Then be sure to brush frequently to keep the plaque at bay."
"You should have seen my one-year-old lab tear around the yard when I first kicked the Jolly Pet 6-inch Teaser Ball to her. I've never seen her so happy and excited! She grabs it, pushes it around, drops it and looks up at me, and lets me kick it some of the time. She chases it like crazy. It's kind of like a soccer game and good exercise for both of us! She hasn't chewed through the ball yet, and she has eaten all her other toys. The ball also makes noise when it rolls, due to the smaller ball inside. We love this toy. It is her second favorite toy, with Bad Cuz coming in first."
"Finally after buying several different dog collars, I finally have one that works for me. I control the traning of the dog behavior not the collar. I have been using this product for awhile now and it is great. I can control how much of a sting the dog receives if any. With the good dog and bad dog busser, once they know what they are they do the trick before I ever have to use the 1,2,3,or 4th level. It is light weight for my dog whom only weights 6.5lbs. Now my dog looks out the window and see's what is going out outside without the barking all the time. It is nice to have the window shades up so we can let in light and see out. You must watch the video to see how to use and my advice is only one adult controls the collar, and only use for training. I would recommened this product to anyone with a small dog. I have spent alot of money and finally found one that really works under my control not the collar. All the other ones I bought didn't do what they said. This is the best!"
My Hedgie absolutely loves his tree trunk! It gives him more privacy than the standard igloo. This looks very nice in the cage also.
"Good for:Keeping dog interested and busyPreventing bloat or vomiting in lightning-fast eatersMaybe not good for:Heavy chewersGreat toy for our four-month-old puppy! He's reached the manic puppy phase and the ball is a reliably interesting and energy-absorbing toy. When full, it easily spills food and when low, he has to really work to get the last of the kibble out.For dogs who bolt their food, this toy is a great solution. He's eaten fast enough to make himself vomit twice - and I'm always afraid of bloat - so he now gets a full ball before breakfast, when he's starving. Slows him down for the remainder. It holds about 1/3 a cup of kibble.Have not yet tried to run it through the dishwasher but so far it easily wipes clean. Our puppy only really chews a lot on his ""gross"" chew toys like marrow bones, bully sticks or ears and ignores his nylabone. Having owned serious chewers before, I would say this is not a chew toy. Give it to the dog, and when it's empty, take it back. It won't hold up.*Update"
"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers. The cats loved it and so did I, for the first 6 hours. The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake, caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours. I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier. Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked. This is true! C'mon you engineers. This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on. Great idea but a real mess to clean up. It is getting returned tomorrow. :("
I would rare it a zero if that was an option. No one has contacted me to tell me why it is not here
"My dog is a very picky eater - she will not touch most of the dog foods, including some of the treats. We always try new stuff to find something that will fit her preference. DINGO mini bones was just the right choice! She loves the taste, which shows through how quickly she eats the treats. We give her 2 a day, which I think is the perfect amount.Overall, great product!"
"For being an 8 loop shape, It works good. Both cats were able to slip out of it fairly quickly the first time I put the harness on having fitted it snugly. Snug isn't good enough. It has to be on very tight to be effective (particularly around the shoulders/ abdomen). Do that and it works wonderfully. Getting either cat to walk was impossible though. They would both rather be choked and dragged across gravel (at a very slow speed) than get up and walk along with me. They just don't get it like a dog does. I wouldn't waste my money if I were you!"
"I bought two of these for my Westie and Scottie. They are the perfect size for them, they would also work for a little larger dog. I'm also able to stack them so they don't take up as much room. Great product for the price."
"Love this crate. Also have the one that's a bit larger. Sets up and breaks down very easily. Just remember to buy one size down than recommended. Bought this for my 15 lb rat terrier and it's just the right size. The one recommended is way too big, especially if you plan to use to help with housebreaking."
"These are great and my dog loves them, but if you put them in normally (rounded side outwards), my dog can east more of it in a day leaving jsut a ring that she can't get out of the ball, and then grows bored of. Putting them in the other way makes them last as long, but doesn't keep the dog as active with the toy either. Still a great product"
"One would think that a pooper scooper is an easy concept to figure out and yet this one seems to put the rest to shame. Firstly, it's hidden except for the handle. Which is awesome for those of us who don't know what to do with it when we're done and try to hide it behind the cat box but still wince every time we see it because it looks gross. The head is hidden and sits neatly in a little cupped tray inside the swivel out compartment. Plus the scoop itself has a wavy edge to scrape those stubborn *ahem* presents off the sides or bottom of the litter box. I never thought of it before, but after using it, it was much easier to scoop. Plus the actual size of the head is great, no overspill, easily handles everything you want to pick up, even the heavy stuff."
Although there is no size description - the picture of the LARGE dog standing in the cage would lead one to THINK they are getting a large kennel. WARNING - this thing is for *toy breeds* according to the *tiny* box that arrived in the mail.
"These are just terrific!! If I can't find my cats, all I have to do is shake the container and they come running from where ever they were hiding out!! These are great training snack for the puppies as well! I have had a hard time finding these in the stores, so this is the BEST place to get them!!"
"Product arrived quickly, was very easy to install and operate, and seems to be working fine. After placing it on my just recently ice covered pond, within hours it melted a hole thru it and has maintained it since in well sub freezing temps. What convinced me to buy THIS unit over others...is its low use of electricity, only 100 watts !!"
"Okay, this does work. I read other reviews and I have to agree, if your dog pushes off with their front paws, then this will help a lot! She still tries to forge ahead, but she no longer is pulling my arm forward. So I don't feel like I need a chiropractic adjustment after my walks. It is a bit of a drag to get the thing on, but once you have them in it, you're good to go for a pleasant walk. And you will get faster at getting them in it. My dog is only 30 pounds, and the collar looks really thick, but she is comfortable in it. I recommend this product! It worked for me!"
"a must have for any medical pack/first aid kit/vetranarian kit. of course these sterile curved needles are by far the best for stiching, so keeping several of these packets is a good idea for quick work in a bad situation. good buy."
"The ball inside is not heavy enough, which makes this product leak slowly. The attachment is flimsy and no match for my puppy, so it can't be used inside. According to directions, if you are going to use it for a chain link fence, you have to go to a hardware store to buy an additional piece. I plan to return this product."
"My dog is a mix of both small/medium sized breeds and large. He was a rescue so his age is not for certain, but I believe he is about 9 years old. His body has slowed down, but mentally he still acts like a puppy. Unfortunately his body could not keep up and my dog was having mobility issues. Since I have begun using Duralactin, he is a new dog physically. I only give him half the recommended dosage and I have already seen great improvement. All aches and pains appear to be gone and I could not be more pleased - great product."
"I have had these steps for almost two years now, with no complaints. I bought them for my 2 Boston Terriers (15 and 20lbs) to get on and off my bed. They use them all the time and it took only minutes for them to learn how to use them. I have noticed that it does shift a little when the run up and down them, but because they are small it's never been an issue. However, with a larger dog, I'm not sure how that would hold up. It folds up easily and is very lightweight. I would definately buy another if I needed to."
"I wasn't expecting much with this filter because of the reviews. I was told it is a great filter so I decided to give it a go (plus its pretty cool).I don't quite understand those who say they have problems with noise. There is a range that you have to keep our water level between. As long as it isn't too high or too low, it is pretty quite. The water sound is louder than some other filters I've had, but the motor is barely audible. It won't take long for you to figure out at what level to keep the water.The second problem it the bio wheel not rotating. I can't figure out how this can happen if the filter is clean. I keep the bushings of the bio wheel clean and it rotates just as well as the day I purchased it.The third problem I read on here is the restart difficulty. I did have difficulty restarting the filter once, when it kicked off as I was setting the tank up. I don't blame the filter though because I caused back pressure to form in the intake tube due to rearranging the tank decorations. You just have to know how to restart it. If you have problems, follow the steps below:1. Unplug the filter and raise the intake tube a couple centimeters.2. Prime the filter (fill it with water). By raising the intake tube, you prevent the water from siphoning through the intake tube into the tank.3. Make sure the water level of the tank comes up to the outlet ramp of the filter.4. Have someone plug the filter in. When you feel the pressure of the impeller, lower the intake tube a couple inches back to its original location.The water should start flowing.If you purchase this filter and it starts misbehaving, just take a step back and calmly follow the instructions. The filter is most likely not the reason why it isn't working. Its a great filter and I would by it again any day."
"What a great idea - put a little door for a cat in a pet gate in order to keep out dogs. I assembled the unit and set it in place (in a doorway to a bathroom that had the cat's food, water, and litterbox) in less than 20 minutes. Our cat walked up, head-butted the little door, and walked right in. Our dogs followed, stuck a head through, then more, and realized they could get through too. There are two of them, both mid-size terriers, a Westy and a Scottie. Defeat? No, being male, I went for the duct tape. Taping down the opening by a third in width, the cat slips through with no problem and the dogs try a little and give up. Problem solved and, for now, we all coexist happily. I'm going to get some white-painted roof flashing and cut it to size, with tabs I can fold over the gate parts to secure it. Hope it will look as good as the gate itself.Memo to Carlson Pet Products"
I was not sure if this product would work. I have been very pleased with the results. The dogs ears smelll great and it is easy to apply. I will be purchasing this product in the future it works as described.
"Let me just say, this thing is confusing to set up unless you follow the directions exactly. Do not loose that instruction sheet, or you might as well just buy a new one. I did find after setting it up, though, it worked great. The batteries lasted over a year in mine. The count of number of feedings was handy to give me comfort that the thing was actually feeding. The only bigger downside was that you could only deliver food in 1/4 cup increments. This worked fine for my cat, but if you want ""just a tad less"" or ""just a tad more,"" you're out of luck. My cat loved it, and I wouldn't live without it again. It's just annoying to program."
"This is the only dry cat food my picky cat will eat. Plus the vet said his teeth are looking better now that he has been eating it, when I adopted him he had bad tartar/plaque and early gum disease. He has much less hairballs now too! My younger cat eats mostly this dry food. My older cat still prefers his canned food but always saves room for this too."
"I've never scooped a litter box before so I don't know how much of a hassle it is. Omega Paw is my first litter box and it wow'ed me how easy to use!!! Takes like 30secs to clean out the litter box and no mess wut-so-ever. Just roll the box and pull out the trap, done!"

"great fun for my giant breed puppy.we'll see how long it takes him to eat the handle. So far, it's intact and fun for fetch."
"I bought one of these dog houses years ago and loved the ease of cleaning it. Then I bought several of the 'big, white, dome-shaped houses'... a person needs to use a long handled brush and lean inside to scrub their interior. When I began boarding dogs, I searched to find Outbak, because it can be taken apart from the center, making cleaning an ease. This design of dog house also fits through standard size kennel gates, which can be narrow. I also like that the roof (top) can be removed during the Summer and the dog's bedding placed in the lower half. Dogs enjoy their bed without becoming too warm in an enclosed dog house."
"I have a dog trainer friend who refers to these Natural Balance rolls as ""doggy heroin"". Her dogs will do just about anything to get some, so she uses them as training treats rather than as a regular dog food. The first time I opened a roll I was surprised at the smell. It smells like REAL FOOD! And my Timmy dog thinks it is great! He thinks he is getting people food when he gets some so he feels even more special than he usual."
"We bought this after reading a review in the Whole Dog Journal. The cover fits perfectly in both of our cars and it is a quick fit so we can remove it easily or cover the seats just as quick when needed.We take our dog hiking and to the dog park weekly. He is always the dirtiest dog, like the pig pen of dogs. We have always just used blankets and towels in the past because every cover that we have come across smells so bad or slides around. The nice thing about the Solvit is that you can just shake it off. All of our friends now want this cover."
"I have an 80lb Old English Bulldog. All muscle but super friendly. He got this huge before he became one years old. Since a puppy, he has been obedient to commands. All around good behavior, but he's a chewer and LOVES to pull when outside. I've tried everything, voice commands, normal collar, shock collar(didn't like walking around with a buzzer in my hand), harness, and that silly leash that wraps around the snout (try that with a bulldog snout,waste of time). I saw the prong collar on the Dog Whisperer show, but i was one of those people that thought the prongs looked dangerous. So i stayed with a normal leather collar, and chalked it up as exercise every time i fought to keep my dog by my side when he would see other dogs or wanted to play with children. Then one night while walking we ran into a couple of deer. My dog went into defense and pulled so hard that he somehow popped the metal link on the collar. He bolted after the deer and disappeared into the night. After about 10 minutes i found him safe, and no deer hopefully were injured. I kept thinking what if he would have been hit by a car, or scared someone. I finally gave in and bought this collar. After reading several informative reviews, i educated myself on the CORRECT use of the collar. You MUST buy the right size for your dog, and properly fit the collar in order for everything to go smoothly.The first day i received it i waited until the night walk to practice with my dog. The collar is very nice, solid construction. I fitted the collar to my dogs upper neck, just below the ears. My dog was not happy. While outside he attempted to pull hard, and immediately knew something was different. He tried shaking it off and attempting several barrel rolls to remove the collar. At no time did i pull the collar, he just didn't like the feel. After about 5 minutes he finally gave in. He walked next to me the entire walk, when he would try to pull, i would give a light tug. My dog immediately stopped pulling and heeled WITHOUT me verbally telling him to do so. The next couple of walks, PERFECT. No pulling. During the morning walk when we would run into all the other dogs in the neighborhood my dog passed the test again. No pulling, he waits for me to approach the dogs and doesn't try to drag me with him. This collar is perfect, and the price makes it a no brainer. Make sure you educate yourself on the use of the collar before purchasing it or bashing it. Not inhumane at all, my dog would gasp for air and seem like he was purposely choking himself when i would walk him with normal collars. Big difference with this collar. Even if you have the best trained dog in the world, the dog could one day decide not to listen. Why risk the animal getting hurt, causing an accident, or someone suing you because your dog frightened them. This collar is insurance it never happens. Best thing i ever bought for my dog."
"I had one of these Coolaroo beds for about 10-11 years that my two Labradors shared and loved it. It finally, after all that time started ripping in the seam area...no problem, it was old. I ordered this one to replace it expecting the same great quality. 24 hours later after I assembled it I noticed two holes in the material cover! I was so disappointed and sent it back. I have ended up ordering another one in a different color to see if that makes a difference in the material quality. I haven't gotten it yet. If the material looks flimsy like it wont last several years of everyday use I'll send it back too."
My one cat loves this toy. He will carry it around and play fetch. It has plastic eyes which some people might want to take off in case their cats could chew them off and swallow.
"This is a fantastic product. I started using it about a year and a half ago in conjunction with Nordic Naturals Cod Liver Oil. These two products together have changed the skin and hair condition of my dog from brittle and scratchy to soft and silky. Prior to using these products my dog was literally tearing her hair out and had bald patches of red, scaly dry skin. I can't thank these two manufacturers enough for the calming effect they have had on our girl's life."
The product seemed great from the human viewpoint
"This is perfect for storing pet food. A 20lb bag fit perfectly! It closes and opens very easy, with an airtight seal to keep the food fresh. No more ripped bags all over the floor (due to the kids trying to feed the dogs). I am very happy with my purchase and have considered buying a smaller one for the cat food."
"I purchased this gate to put in my mothers home when she is caring for my son. It was the perfect length to fit in her sunroom. Her opening is a little over 8 ft. My only complaint would be that the locking/latching system on this is a bit tricky. It's not as easy as opening and closing like some baby gates out there. You actually have to work at it by latching a hook on the bottom of the gate and then push on a very hard button on the top of the gate to then hook on to a latch. If it sounds confusing...it is. Other than the locking system, it is functional and serves it's purpose."
We switched to Frontline because our dog kept biting her foot when we applied Revolution. We have been using this for a couple of years and have had no problems.
"This is a great brush for removing the loose hairs from your pet. My kitties are so silky and shiny after I brush them with this and my boy cat LOVES it. He comes running when I get it out and rolls around on the floor and purrs hard while I brush him. The other kitty it a little brat so I have to pin her down by the scruff to brush her. Whatever. As others have said, the brush does not contain the hair so they remain loose on the cat and pile up on the floor. As others have apparently not done, you can just clean these hairs up as part of your grooming routine, remove the excess loose hairs from your cat with a wire slicker brush and just clean up the floor after you're done grooming. Presto! Groomed cat AND cleaner furniture/floors. I even bought this as a gift for a friend when he got his first cat because it's so great!"
My dog has skin allergies. He is not allergic to this. This is obviously the most delicious dog food he has ever eaten!
"In our home, Maxx gets excited when asked if he wants a 'chicken cookie'. He'll do anything for one of these dehydrated discs of chicken. Between the size of a quarter and a half-dollar, these 'cookies' are easily snapped into smaller serving sizes (very useful for training treats). They come in a see-through plastic container with a screw-top lid. Besides the size and convenience being a plus, so too, is its ingredient"
"For 8 bucks, these are a fantastic buy. They cut well, and the guard is a nice feature...though if you keep your dog's nails short, you will definitely not be cutting enough off to hit the guard.They are sharp, comfortable, well bulit, and feel like they will last a long time."
I ordered these for crates that I will use when I drive my cats across country- wanted them to have a few months to get used to them. The are well made and the bolster is a great place to rest your chin if you are a cat. I gave it a 4 as the base could be a little softer to me but the cats probably would have given them a 5. I have not yet washed them but they look like they will wash well. And they fit like a dream in the crate. They are stitched firmly and seem like they will be durable.
"Dog loved this bone. I think there should be a star section for price and value comparison. I probably would have taken a star off for price, but I believe more in reviewing the product for the product, not the price."
"I was at my wits end. My little cocker spaniel was totally stressing me out. He was 5 months and did NOT like the kennel. He never barked until I would close the front door after leaving to go to work. As soon as I opened it again he was silent. A bit sneaky for a baby anyway, I did not want to use an electronic collar and the calming spray in his kennel did not work. I had tried just about everything the Vet and pet stores had suggested and none of the information I found online was effective either. I put this citronella spray collar on him and he barked once. ONCE!! I had a video camera on him and within 5 min. he laid down and fell asleep. It was a beautiful thing. After 3 times(3 days) of turning the collar on so it would spray I tried one day with the power off and sure enough he was still quiet. Now one month later I don't even need to put it on him. He was getting himself so agitated that once he was forced to settle down he did. It was a life saver for this condo dweller."
So far this door is great. No problems. The only issue would be that you have to take the screen door off to hammer it together.
"I recently purchased a 6-unit package of Frontline Plus from Bargain 123. Three of the pipets had ruptured in transit, which was no fault of Bargain 123. I explained the situation to Bargain 123 and they promptly provided a return authorization and processed credit to my Visa account. I would have given Bargain 123 a 5-star rating if the package arrived as expected, still I was very pleased with the customer service provided and will definately consider doing business with this vendor in the future."
"My dog doesn't like the taste of Angel Eyes in his food (I mix it in). He will eat it about 50% of the time if I don't use a full dose and if he is really hungry. I would really like to use this product beacause he has really bad tear staining. I believe it works, but I don't know how to get him to acquire a taste for it."
"My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, ""natural,"" flavored bones and thought.... ""SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!"" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great."
HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TO LET THIS THING DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES! DOESN'T WORK. WASTE OF MONEY. SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY DOLLARS.
We bought these from a pet store originally to replace the grocery store bags we had been using. These are thick enough that my wife is even willing to do the pickup. I will be sure to never run out of these.
"I WOULDN'T WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT, IT IS GARBAGE AND DOES NOT WORK. HAD TO GO TO MY LOCAL PET STORE AND SPEND THE $23 TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. FROM NOW ON I WILL SPEND THE MONEY NECESSARY TO GET THE JOB DONE. THIS PRODUCT IS A FAIL!!!"
"Its hard to know if it works or not in my case.....not saying that it doesnt work....Its just hard to tell....but dont let this deter you from buying it....be swayed by other peoples reviews, not mine."
"My cats love this and are both are drinking more water since I bought this. It's big, but my cats don't seem to care."
My vet recommended fish oil because my dog has flaking dry skin. The results after a couple of months have been excellent!
"My dog tends to get itchy skin in the spring due to allergies. I normally give her a bath once every two weeks, and I have tried several shampoos. Some of the ones I have tried tend to dry her skin out and make her even more sensitive. This shampoo helps calm her allergies down and it also doesn't have a strong scent which is to my preference. I will stick to using this shampoo for my dog forever.My dog is a lab/shepard mix and weighs 80 pounds. 3 years old now."
"Although it may not be as attractive as some other bowls, this is a must for your dog. I used to have to clean up spilled water every other week or so but since I got the spill-less bowl, I never have to! I've also taken this on car trips and there's no way the water can slosh out. Love it."
This thing is amazing! I have a blue heeler and i hardly ever see hair in the house any more. Couple times a week and she's good to go.
I like the feel of it. Very solid and secure. I like the fact that it won't absorb water like a nylon collar. It fits nicely and can be adjustable. It's very different and unique. I bought my beagle (female) the pink one so she has a lot of comments on it so far. Plus people won't confuse her as a HE.
what can i say it is charcoal to keep my fish tank clean and clear. The price was right. Will i order again ? yes as long as i have other items to get free shipping. My tank is crystal clear after using this product.
"I am a white, white Maltese. Before Mommy started giving me the Pro-Treat Beef Liver, freeze dried, my tears were black and stained my face. With my enjoying one treat per day, my beautiful white face is so beautiful. I eat only natural, non colored food and drink spring water. But Mommy says the treats were the icing on the cake. AND, I love them too."
"This product works as described. The only thing I didn't like was it seemed to clump a bit when sprinkling it out (making waste as some spots were heavier then needed). It also has a nice scent that helped the house smell cleaner. Best if left for more than 24 hours to really set it. I am going to be cleaning the carpets in the near future, once the carpet dries I will reapply this to help keep the scent locked in and the fleas out (and yes my dog does get a monthly flea treatment)."
"love the price [with 5 large dogs], we need all the monetary breaks we can get to keep us within our family budget."
One of the few treats my dog likes. They are small so they are good for training rewards. Will buy again.
"My cat loves this toy - there are plenty of feather and strips of metallic ribbon in a nice plump tail. However, the wand itself is so thin that it has bent just from holding it. This would be a really lovely toy if the handle was more substantial, but, as it is, I don't expect it to last much longer before it breaks."
My Dachshund started to tear off the tennis ball type material within 60 seconds and within 10 minutes had to whole toy scalped.
"My dog is 86 pounds, and the Vet prescribed this lower dose Denosyl. My dog was expected to die, but she fully recovered. It's thought that prednisone may have induced the failure. It was hard to get her to take the pill without biting it, as if broken then the pill is no good as it dissolves in the stomach where acid destroys it. But she is alive today, so no complaints!"
"You get what you pay for...good price but poor quality, however does have some weight to them so, they may last longer than others. But do you want them to?"
this is a great toy for any dog that likes small toys. my dog loves this toy so much and has played with it so much that it now looks like a sad mouse not a beaver. its a cute toy with an extra squeaker you cant beat that.
I tried two tubes on my Maltese with little or not results. The dog still has fleas. We are switching to Comfortis pill to try and eliminate the problem.
crate was easy to assemble and just the right size for my 2.2lb puppy would recommend I rate it 5 stars
My cats love these with a little catnip. The baby kittens sit on them and play with the ball that is attached to the turbo scratcher.
"Unlike most cat toys, this is one toy my cat never gets tired of playing with and even our little Papillon dog likes to chase it. A plus is there isn't really much to break and the ""Birds"" can easily be replaced."
"My Shih-tzu loves this ball. Although the ball is about as big as his head, he can pick it up easily. He will push the ball all around the house until his treats are dispensed."
"Other than regular cat furniture (the wood type with carpet stapled to it), this is the only thing my cat actually uses. Everything else, from motion-sensing-electronic-mouse-moving Cheese Mountain to a multitude of chase-me type toys were investigated and enjoyed for 1 to 25 seconds at best. Anyway, so there's 3 parts to the oddly named Cat ""Spa"":(1) The central rubbing area with strange poking out teat. Well it looks odd but the cat seems to enjoy it, and has partially eaten the teat at the center so that usually signals acceptance. This part is why I only gave it 4 stars, and not five however. Firstly I had to superglue the teat piece (p.s. I apologize for my overuse of the word ""teat"" in this review) in as the cat can easily remove it/bite it off. Secondly I've kicked the entire center piece off about 20 times, it only has 3 weak plastic tabs keeping it in place, so evenutally I epoxyed it on and then re-superglued it later. I guess maybe that's unfair but it's at just the right height where your feet will hit it when stepping over.(2) Spikey areas designed for cats to rub their faces on. This is the least used area, I don't think my cat has done this since the first day. They also have some space for cat-nip to be loaded in them, which might incite some more interest, but quite frankly I don't have time or desire to keep fresh catnip in this thing.(3) The best part"
"Clumps hard enough for scooping, but there is little to no odor coverage. My cat is long-haired and this stuff is ALWAYS caught in his fur and feet. I have to clean him and sweep the floors after every use-- it's very lightweight and flaky, I assume this is why it's always in his fur."
Amazon should not assist this product to be sold with so many negative reviews. The pain and anxiety the pets have endured ;(
"I bought these 'retriever rolls' for my 18 month old yellow lab. He went through most of one in an evening. They are not very compressed and unroll easily. He got his teeth attached to the end that was unrolling, put his paws on the roll, pulled hard and basically unrolled it like fruit leather. The rolls don't hold up as long as others and I won't be reordering them."
"first of all, the shipping is really fast though it says will take 5--9 days. it took 3 days only.easy to set up, and just the right size. when I first see it, i thought it is a little too big, as days pass by, i believe it's just the right size. My puppy is only 9 weeks old and he's tiny. But bigger pads actually save you more money because they don't pee at the same place usually. they like to stand on neat area and pee on clean area too. Sometimes he mess a little bit on the edge, but it is very easy to clean. I use wet wipe, wipe once, all set!The edge is a little bit too high for my tiny puppy. It gets used to it pretty soon though. I would say it is a great product for house-breaking.I found PetSmart sell them 24 dollar in the store. Much better get it here cuz no tax no shipping cost. Save you even 1 trip of gas too. lol....I recommend this product. I'm sure your puppy will love it. Just remember to buy one size bigger when you get it."
"easy to clean, but fragile. I use this at my work for the mice they love itedit"
Very good product. Well constructed using good quality material. My dog refuses to jump up into the back of our adventure mobile until his green camper is properly in place. It's his personal comfort zone.
"My puppy is a VERY picky treat eater. I spent a lot of money buying brand names treats, but my puupy only sniffed at them and walked away!! The vet gave me a package of Lean Treats. My puppy, Daisy, absolutely LOVES it! Plus I could actually make 2 pieces of one treat! This is probably one of the best treats available out there!"
Coat is very cute but ran a little short.My brown toy poodle looks adorable in it and people stop all the time to say how cute.
My 57pd dog has allergies and scratches unbelievably. She is under Dr care and was advised to try this shampoo first before going through the allergy testing. This Shampoo is spendy but worth every cent for the improvement Zoey is feeling. She sill needs to see the allergy Vet but this helps a lot.
"My dog is one picky eater..But she loves this dry food, when I mix it with Beneful wet dog food..She's happy..I'm happy...."
Very happy with this product. We camp and it covers all annoying insects our dog should encounter. Easy to appy. To after effects.
Finally! I was able to find a harness that fit my dog properly. He is a 60 pound doberman mix and the medium was squeezing his chest and the large fell off him. This tweener size fits him perfectly!
"This cause our 3 month old kitten so much stress that she developed stress colitis (diahrrea w/ blood). And it was due to the CitiKitty, her fecal came back normal. She only had two accidents in a month and that was when we moved up a step but we couldn't stand seeing her so upset all the time. We gave up after a month and went back to the litter box. The product was fine but this just didn't work for our sensitive kitty's tummy!"
"Maybe I just didn't read the description closely enough, but for the price I was expecting this to come with a tank as well, since it read Reptile Kit, 10 gallon. As it was, it's a few bits and pieces I could have purchased locally and separately for less, and totally unsuitable to my needs, since my son got a Chinese water dragon which requires a heat lamp rather than a heat rock. I'm sending it back, but I have to do it at my own expense, since Amazon says the product not meeting my needs is not their fault."
this looked like it would work but my already fat cats would get fatter if they wouldve used the post itself. they were afraid of the givei was able to return it
"We Bought the 4 inch one & use it on our Cattle Dog mix and Border Collie Mix and any dogs that come to visit us and the results are amazing. It really does work well.Buy it instead of the cheaper ones as they did not work at all like this one does. God Bless America and you should too! FURminator DeShedding Tool (LARGE) 4"" wide edge"
This product is definitely not good for labs who love to chew. We were optimistic that our 2 year old lab would get some quality chew time out of this toy. To my disappointment it lasted a whole 5 minutes before she had chewed the bone in half and chewed off small pieces of rubber. She was very proud of herself. Definitely not for dogs who love to chew. However when I contacted Planet Dog about the toy they provided some exceptional customer service and some better options for our dog. I would try other products from them based on their customer service and attentiveness to their customers.
"This is the best tool I've tried on our German Shepherd. It truly works as they say it does. The design is MUCH better than others we have-comfortable handle grip and great angle for combing through. Works on our cats as well! We use it on all our animals. Just be sure to use it on a large dog in an area where you don't mind a lot of hair, because you're going to pull a lot out with this."
I was so disappointed in this product. So many people recommended this product to me so I got it for my dog. It did not get rid of the fleas at all. I can't say whether it works on ticks or not because we are fortunate not to have many here. My dog only goes outside to use the bathroom and she's got fleas. Will not be purchasing this again in the future.
"I had no problem setting up this feeder--about twice as hard as installing a radio alarm clock and half as hard as installing a DVD player. I use it regularly and like the flexible schedule options. The container is compact, strong and airtight. My cat ignores it when not in use and hasn't been able to game the mechanism. Worth the extra money."
This is a product that we have used for several years. It has thus far proven effective. We will continue to use it as long it continues to work. I was a little surprised to see the cost of this product go up over $10 from our previous purchase from Amazon.
"This deshedding tool is way more effective than my last fur brush. Maybe it's just tugging fur out of my cats, but it removes at least ten times the volume of a typical fur brush.Also, I have found that running this lightly over jeans will pick up stray furs after a deshedding session."
"My Goldendoodle LOVES these! I am sooo glad I was able to find them on Amazon.com. They can be a bit expensive, but if you cut them up into smaller pieces they last a long time. Please don't discontinue this item!Thanks,Harriet"
"My poor 2.5 year old dog (Rody) has been itchy since day one. I can't remember a day when his rear end didn't have bald spots. Yes, I changed his food to the good stuff and added fish oil to his dish which only helped a little bit. I've also only used the best of shampoos and treats. Still remained the bald and bloody spots. To make things worse, I recently moved to a new neighborhood I'll call flea-town. I've spent hundreds on flea treatments for the yard, house, and dogs to no avail. I could literally comb off about thirty fleas three times a day from Rody. I got Trifexis for the flea problem (same active ingredient as Comfortis). This worked for the most part, but there was still the occasional few fleas.I was skeptical when I got these yeast tablets because they're so darned cheap, but there were plenty of rave reviews on them. I'm glad I made the purchase. After about a week I saw results. Not a single flea (finally!). Rody's fur grew back, his dandruff was gone, and he doesn't whine from his itchiness anymore. It's bloody magic.Granted the flea results were mixed with the use of Trifexis, but he was itchy before the fleas made an appearance. This made a huge difference and will be on my shelf from now on."
I just received the bed today. The overall impression is that its cheap and won't last a month. The cover material is very thin and I expect it not to make it though two or three washings. People in reviews complained on how hard it was to replace the cover after a washing. I'm sure that shrinkage due to the thin material also contributed to the difficulty.I'm debating on whether to return it.
"This is a great soft toy. It's funny and dogs love it! My only complaint is it's kind of thin, so I don't think it will last too long, but it'll be fun while it lasts and the price was great!"
"These steps werent too bad for the price, but they were a bit flimsy. I actually ended up returning them because my dog was too afraid to use them!"
"I love this tool. My dog is a 9 year old German shepherd, and like most GSDs, she sheds a lot. Usually little amounts throughout the year and then a twice yearly blowout. Thankfully, I had the furminator this spring when she blew her coat. Giant piles of undercoat outside. It's pretty easy to use, and my hand didn't get tired or cramped up. It has a good weight to it. My dog doesn't mind it as much as other shedding tools like the rake or comb. I think it's because the teeth are so close together. She even lets me use it on her tail which has never been easy before. I've used it twice on my cat as well, and got a lot of hair off of her."
"My cats absolutely love this fountain. It works great, and takes very little to keep clean. The resovoir is a must though."
"I have two cats and they both ""miss"" the litter box from time to time. We decided to add a third box and the Omega Paw has been great. They both like to use it, its easy to clean, and the lid helps contain odors and unslightly messes. We use Cat Attract litter which is scoopable and both cats love as well. I've already referred other cat owners to this box--its great for the price and functionality!"
My dog will not touch this food. Very surprised because all reviews were positive. He will not eat it with chicken added or anything else. I am aware of a recall on some of the Wellness brand but this food was not included in the recall.
"This product did not have the sucking power I thought it would have. As someone else said, the nozzle has to be lower than the hose. In my fish pond, getting this accomplished was almost next to impossible, especially in the lower end of the pond. The container, however, is more convenient than a mesh bag."
"I bought two of the large pads for my dogs over a year ago (Oct 2010) and so far so good. I built two insulated dog houses from scratch and placed a pad in each one. They are protected from the weather and are not left out exposed to the sun. I think keeping these protected from the weather and sun will go a long way to making these pads last longer.They work great and keep my dogs nice and toasty. The instructions will tell you that they warm up slowly, so don't expect them to heat up to operating tempature right away. It's not a problem if the dog is wet since these pads are made of a tough plastic. I have tried thick plush pads before but the dogs only end up tearing them apart having fun doing so, they don't even try or can't chew on these since they are thin and lay flat on the floor. My dog houses have a flap door which helps seal in the heat, even when the temparature has dropped below 0, the dogs are still kept warm.I have not experienced the problems reported in other reviews and expect to get a few more years out of these. I will update this review if that changes.My only complaint is that elastic bands on the fleece covers that hold them in place on the pad, broke after a short while. I manually adjust the covers at night. I just ordered two new ones since the old ones are rather dirty now and I'm not going to bother to wash them. This is the reason why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5."
"Haven't found a dog that won't take these over bisquit treats. Light as air, you get a lot in a pound."
I love my test kit and use it often. I think it is a must for when you have an aquarium so that you can know all of the levels. I have shrimp so I also bought the Copper test kit to add to my testing supplies. So much cheaper than at my LFS. I got this for under $20 and my LFS sells it for $30. Great deal!
We have used this collar for my 15lb shih tzu for about 2 years now. And it has kept her in our backyard when nothing else would. We have the underground wire system in addition to a poorly made chainlink fence.Just a word of advice for others - my dog was getting out even wearing this collar and we found out that using one transmitter box for our 2 acre land wasn't enough strength. We got a second transmitter box for just our backyard (for the little dogs) and she gets zapped good if she tries to get out now. It was never the collar's fault or the system really - I think one transmitter can only work well for so far.... But I think this is a good collar. Not sure how strong it is on bigger dogs but for my little one it's not too strong or too weak. And buying batteries through amazon was MUCH cheaper than going to a petstore.
"I love this as a seat cover. I have an SUV and am a dog walker. Lots and lots of dogs are in my car. Wet, sandy and muddy you name it. The cover makes cleaning the car so much simpler"
My cats love greenies & this purchase was great find. Price & quantity was just right. Be nice if they offered a 6 pack in a variety of flavors
"My dog doesn't love being placed in a crate, but luckily she has plenty of room to curl up and move around, which is sometimes hard to find for a 70 pound dog. Highly recommend this."
Kind of flimsy. Didn't realize the foam at the bottom was exposed. Foam is also kind of thin. Was expecting a better quality bed.
"We have two cats that are two years old. One is very energetic and practically figured the ball out right away."" WACK, out comes food. I like this game!"" Her littler mate took a little more encouragement.I didn't take the food away immediately. I started to limit what would go into their regular bowl. I sat with the second cat and nudged the ball so that she could see that food would come out of it. She started to nudge it more and more. After a few days she got the hang of it.It's been great for their health, especially the second cat since she is a bit of a scarfer. It's gets her more active. I love that it's dishwasher safe!"
"I had ordered two of these gates, the problem i had was that the pressure mount would not fix securely between the walls on top and baseboards on lower end. Adding to it, our 8 month daughter on her first attempt was able to push it down with her one hand and crawled right on top of it. I eventually ended up returning these back to amazon who were great in acceptin returns.Pro'sLighthweightEasy to usePriceGood to cordon off an areaCon'sPressure mount is not secure beween walls/baseboard8month Baby was able to push it down in her 1st attemptWe finally bought ""Safety 1st Perfect Fit gate"" as it fits securely even on slightly uneven surface, is very sturdy and we love it."
"Cant go wrong, for the money its hours of fun AND good for the cat. John"
Very good tool to remove loose dog hair; however a small hairline crack located near the blade may occur. This is probably due to the screws.
"I just received this stroller this evening and put it together right way. The rear wheels snapped onto the assembly easily. The rear wheel assembly was a little difficult to attach to the frame as the frame was a little narrower than the assembly mounts. A few gentle taps with a hammer to the frame and the rear wheel assembly then slide on and snapped into place. The front wheel assembly also snapped into place easily. That's it! The cup holder was already installed. The unit moves smoothly, the wheels are air free (so no flats). The frame folds down very easily, yet has a simple set of latches on each side to lock it in place. It is light enough that I can lift the unit and put it my mini-van.The rear wheels have a single bar to lock and release the rear wheels. There is a little flange on the front wheel assembly to lock it in a forward position if you don't want the wheel turning on rough surface terrain.The product appears to be well constructed. There is a support bar around the front on the carrier so the dogs can sit and look out without falling out. There are two lead attachments for two small dogs. I have a 5 pound and a 7.5 pound Papillon and they seem to enjoy being in the stroller (of course liberal use of treats always helps).I pushed the stroller with the dogs in it around my house over tile and wood floors, even over a few dog toys and it rolled easily. I am looking forward to using it at dog competitions where I need to switch dogs rather rapidly. Also I want to use it to keep the dogs calm and quiet in the narrow hallways to go outside from our vacation condo."
This feeder is not only practical but it is also very nice to look at. The drawer for the food is spacious and even our smart german shepherd hasn't figured out how to open it. I highly recommend it.
"Before I begin, we have two cats that poop and pee a moderate amount. We have to clean the litter box every day, otherwise it gets over run and they go on the floor. We got the Litter Locker thinking it would save us a trip to the trash every day.This thing worked great for the first few months- we could use an entire canister in 2 weeks, didn't stink at all, would turn properly. Unfortunately I started to notice a really awful smell in the kitchen, it was the Litter Locker! So I took it outside and scrubbed it down, with dish detergent and regular old clorox. I let it sit out in the sun for about 2 days, and then brought it back inside. One wiff told me that the smell was still there. I did this several times over 3 months, in an effort to remove the smell.Shortly before deciding to clean it, the Litter Locker wasn't turning properly. It would get stuck, the flimsy outside frame would shift and then it wouldn't turn anymore. The solution to this was to cut off the plastic bag tube, tie it off and take it out to the garbage. Then we would pull more plastic out of the canister and restart it again, when it was only halfway done. Unfortunately every time I would try to dump a load in the LL, it wouldn't turn properly, and I'd have to fiddle with it to get it to work.I would say only get this if you have one cat that doesn't go to the bathroom very much. We put it in the recycling because the smell was becoming unbearable."
"I have two small dogs who would scab their noses trying to get out of plastic crates, so I ordered a soft crate, and I have to say, I love it! I was very skeptical after reading reviews, worried they would destroy it, but we've had it about a month and they haven't torn it up! They have scratched at it, but it is all still intact! I love the color. I also like all the openings, front, side and top! It makes it very convenient. We leave it open to help them feel comfortable in it and put their bed in it so it wouldn't feel like a crate when we zipped them up in it. We are also looking forward to taking it with us on camping trips this summer!"
"Simple review...this is a poorly designed product that my daughter's cat easily broke into the first day she had it. We followed the recommendations in the instructions, but the feeder is light weight and poor quality. It is not worth the approximately $30 I paid for it. I cannot recommend this product."
My cats love this simple toy! Even my older (7 year old) cat will jump and run after this toy.
Best price I've found for the same great product that you pay much more for at the vet.
"Zoom grooms are by far the best grooming tool. I only have used it on short hair dogs, but have never found a better product."
"I have found that this product works much better on my mixed breed dog (she's sort of a Lab-Kuvasz mix we think) with a medium length soft coat. On my Border Collie who has much longer and thicker hair, it is considerably less effective than using a comb with wide teeth. Note that Border Collies are on the list of recommended breeds by the makers of the Furminator.Even on my mixed breed dog, it is not a miracle product. She is a heavy shedder and while the Furminator appeared to remove more hair from her than the wire brush I typically use, it has not reduced her shedding much if at all.Some reviewers have commented that he or she believe the Furminator may actually be cutting individual hairs rather than actually removing only dead hair and I think this may be true. The tiny teeth appear to have razor-sharp edges. If it's just cutting off healthy hair to produce the appearance that it is getting more hair off the dog, then it is an inferior brush in my opinion and should be used sparingly at best. At least it seems more comfortable for my dog than the wire ""slicker"" brush which always frightened her a little."
"We purchased this bowl for our puppy, who must stay in a crate when we are not home. She is an active dog and can easily push the bowl out of it's metal ring holder and spill the water in the crate. so it's useless, as we have not found a way to attach the bowl to the holder."
"This litter box is awesome! I don't think I would ever consider it ""Self-Cleaning"", but that doesn't mean I don't love this thing. Fact of the matter, you got to clean up after you animals. If you except not to, you are just giving yourself false-hope. But this thing makes cleaning a litter box so much easier and let gross. You turn the box on it's side, the litter seperates from waste and falls into a compartment, then when you turn it on it's side even more, the waste falls in a little basket. Just flip the box back up in the opposite direction you have turned it, the waste stays in the basket, and the litter falls out of it's compartment, and back to it's original position for you cat to use. Occasionally, you will have to go in there and clean out some scraps that stuck to the box, but that's not a problem if you love you kitty! I have had it for a month now, and wonder how I went so long without it. I recommend this to anyone who has an indoor cat, and it's afraid of the OCCASIONAL clean up."
"during the first 6 days the shut-off valve did not work well, the bowl was constantly dripping. the problem went away after a week, it worked fine for the last 3 weeks."
"Works great for my 40 pound Border Collie / Corgi mix. No fleas or ticks in 18 months of use and no adverse reactions. I have a house dog, but he spends at least 2 hours a day outside in the yard and in a wooded area. Amazon has the best price I have found for Frontline Plus."
"This product is wonderful. It relieves my dogs itching, It smell nice with out being to perfumey and it's All Natural. I follow the directions on the bottle and lather my 9 pound furry child up, allowing it to sit for 90 sec. She smells fresh and clean when I am done. Because she is very active and gets into everything I do find she will get her "" doggy"" smell back in about 5-7 days, But hey she's a dog. Every weekend while I clean the house I just put her on my to do list. The price may be a little higher then your run of the mill shampoo but you don't need much. One bottle has last me 8 months (about 32 baths)I doubt you will be disappointed w/ this stuff."
"We have two big dogs (lab mix and coonhound) who love nothing more than to destroy their toys, sometimes within minutes. As a result, we're hard pressed to find inexpensive toys that we know will eventually be torn to shreds. This toy is the best we've found so far, they still destroy it but the price is more palatable than spending $12-$15 on something that won't last. They chew it and play tug with it and we can re-braid and re-tie the knots to give it a longer life, sometimes up to 3-4 weeks. This isn't a bad option if your dog is really hard on toys."
"I purchased a case of 12 for $24.99 (not including s/h) and it was well worth it. Very good bone, with marrow and jerky still left on. My dogs were able to chip and even crack the bone, so you will still need to supervise with this treat. Perfect for large/giant breeds!"
"Frontline Plus was exactly what we needed for Lucy. We put it on her about 6 pm, and the following day she was no longer scratching. It has been approx. 4 weeks, and there are still no fleas to be found. She is a 7 month old American Bulldog weighing approx. 75 lbs, and the first application worked great. We will continue using the remainder of the supply throughout the summer."
"I purchased the Marineland H.O.T. Canister Filter for a few reasons. I have a large, adult turtle in a 60 gallon tank, though it is not filled up all the way. I did some research and found that canister filters are the way to go for large tanks with many fish or for turtles, as they produce much more waste than fish and are messy eaters. However, I was hesitant about a canister filter due to my lack of floor space. This model, however, hangs on the tank easily and is hardly noticable. The pricebwas also extremely reasonable for such a hardy and versitile filter. The carbon filter and the micron filter are also easily interchangable.I started with the micron filter first, since the water looked a bit hazy. In 3 days, it looked as if I had just replaced all of the water in the tank! I have never had a filter that reversed the haziness in my turtle's water. Other filters kept it at bay for a week or two, but this truly does a fantastic job. Now that it is clear, I'm going to switch to the regular carbon filter as my turtle's regular, everyday filter.Just as a note, I did have to fashion some extension tubes so the inlet and outlet would reach the water since my tank is only 75% filled. If the tubes don't reach the water, it is very noisy since there is so much water coming out of the outgoing tube. Once that was fixed, though, it's practically silent.So if you are looking for a hardy canister filter that doesn't have the unattractive tubing or necessary space that other canisters require, I would highly recommend this one! :)"
Puppy loves it and that's great! I love Nylabone products and this one does not disappoint. My pup really enjoyed this immediately and it sure beats chewing other things.
"This product was recommended by the Ohio Statue University Vet School--on this random web page I found on their site, while searching:""how to clean up cat pee."" FON is the best SMELL remover we've ever used--and believe me--we've tried them all!We have the cutest orange, tabby cat-but he has one little issue"
"I absolutely love the Gentle Leader! I have a 5 month old border collie mix puppy who is...yes, a puppy! So what can you expect? It was more difficult for me to get used to the collar than it was for Rags. Getting comfortable with how tight the neck piece must be was a bit hard for me....I kept feeling as though the neck strap was too tight and the nose piece too loose. But pay attention to the instructions! It really does work well when fitted properly.The pup got used to it within a few days and was walking easily within minutes. However, he continues to dislike having the nose piece on when the leash is off. (He doesn't fight it when we are walking, but the minute I take the leash off he tries to get the nose piece off.) The nose and leader piece dangles down when you take the leash off, which bothers the dog. We walk to an area where Rags can be off leash. Now when I take the leash off I pull the nose piece off, pull the leader piece through and tuck it up under the neck piece. The pup simply forgets it is there and runs off to play.I noticed immediately that the Gentle Leader also seems to calm Rags when he is fearful or agitated...something about pressure points according to the video... What a bonus!"
"There are two different types of Adams Flea and Tick Mist. this one is the organic version, and does not work as well as the other type. We have had a terrible flea problem this winter, and I bought this to replace the empty bottle of the non-organic version we had. I would count up to 100 dead fleas falling off our jack russell. But with this, I'm just not getting the same numbers. I would save my money and buy the really potent stuff."
"The overall cage is a good system. It's sturdy and does what it needs to do for our rabbit. The one complaint about the product is that it's pull out urine tray is rather flimsy. It's wobbly so I know one day we'll have an accident and it'll drop pee on the ground. It should be either a little sturdier, or a bit deeper."
"My little lhasa means a lot to us and everytime she has a seizure we feel so bad.We are used to her seizures since they ve been happening sporadically for 3 and 1/2 years now. She is medicated, sees the vet on a regular basis, does blood works and all sorts of tests every 6 months. Basically she is very well taken care of.However, what happened last week was totaly unusual and tragic"
"Bought one for both my dogs and they both fit in there just fine, granted that one is 5 months and the other is a year old but combined they weight about 130 lbs. has a very nice smell to it and seems solid. my puppy chewed it up a little but he stopped after. now if i can just find a mat or something that they can lay on without me coming home to a shredded mess, ill be happy"
"I started my French Bulldog on the Nupro Supplement, combined with a no-grain all natural kibble when he was about 12 weeks of age. He is now a little over 4 months and his coat is very healthy and shiny. His exposed skin on his belly and in his huge bat ears are the perfect shade of gray. No redness or irritation at all. When awake, he has a tremendous amount of energy and runs and hops around the house like he's the happiest dog in the world. I add water to the mix, along with other supplements (please give your dog bonemeal in addition to this), to make a great gravy that he just loves. It never takes him more than 5 or 10 minutes to eat his whole bowl. I highly recommend this supplement."
"My 20lb (at the time) terrier mix had to curl up VERY tightly to uncomfortably fit in it. He filled it up completely, but the website we ordered from (not amazon) charged a high restocking price so we gave it to my brother for his 15lb dog. She fits perfectly. She isn't able to stretch out and still has to curl up but for shorter car rides it works just fine. She definitely enjoys seeing everything go by from the window. Now at 25lbs, my own dog still likes to jump in it when he gets a chance. Having said that, the sides are not too sturdy if your dog leans on them and can tip the seat or fall out. It is also difficult to clean. Somehow, fur gets under the cover and since the seat is made of foam, it attracts fur and is hard to remove. The cover is also hard to get back on and after about one year of regular use (maybe once every two weeks), it has really worn down. It would be a good idea to use a blanket or some additional cover on top of the original cover. It is still a good car seat and the foam has held up pretty well. It really is overpriced, being that it is just a large piece of foam with a small drawer and cover on it; however, if the sides were sturdier and the seat were easier to clean I could give this 5 stars because the dogs do seem to enjoy it."
I certainly enjoyed having the product soak up the strong smelly pet urine! My pet Yorkies are not quite used to the pad above it yet but I have noticed a signifiant decrease in order!
"I haven't used this item myself, but I gave 4 of them as gifts to dog owners. A week later, I got very good feedback from them."
"ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box is very good and functions well. Compared to the new and improved Littermaid unit which I recently bought and discarded after a few weeks the ScoopFree box is fantastic. The only issue is the efficiency, storage capacity and cost of the litter trays."
"Just like an earlier critic of this item wrote, I too was disappointed, ""only at first"", that this mat was a hard surface board. We always want soft and cozy for our cats, but once my Sadie began using it, I felt differently about it. She absolutely loves it, and so do I. I can see that if it was soft, it would likely not be a safe item, since cats like to claw, so this hard surface prevents that danger. I've had it for two cold winter seasons now, and it is a life saver for Sadie, and me too, as I no longer worry about her since she prefers to stay outside, unlike my other house cats. What I have done is put a large soft blanket under it, with the edges of blanket raised above the surface edge of the mat, so when she lays on the mat, she can lean against the soft blanket, to make it a bit more cozy. The way I have it set up, the blanket never lays on top of the mat, as the instructions recommend. If it's cold outside, I always know where to find her. I highly recommend this item, along with the electric water bowl. I cannot tell you how frustrating it's always been, replacing frozen water in her dish, several times a day in the past. With this electric dish, the water never gets warm, but just keeps the water from freezing. I'm very happy with both products, and my Sadie is too. I highly recommend both items."
I did everything to try to get this awful0smelling thing to work and my dogs wanted nothing to do with it. Waste of money.
For Furry pets:
I bought this about a year and a half ago however I didn't buy it from Amazon. I now have two Golden Retreviers and use the comb on both every other day. The comb looks like the picture but has both long and short teeth. The handle is great and makes the comb easy to use. I now brush the dogs first then use the comb to quickly remove extra hair. I left feed back on the flea comb also.
"The smell I was warned of I was somewhat prepared for. ..I was not prepared to not be able to be ANYwhere on the entire level of the house while the smell was evaporating. ..Took me about 4-5 hours of running the house fan, WITH the windows open, to be able to be back in the room where the rug was. ..(Me and my cat stayed upstairs in my bedroom with the doors shut until the smell evaporated). ..The smell is VERY strong. ..I'm one of those weirdos that likes the smell of gasoline and fresh paint. ..And the smell of this product is on ANOTHER level entirely. ..I literally felt that if I breathed it in that I was going to pass out and/or die. ..It REALLY stinks!!!I was not prepared for the warning message at the top of the instructions"
I bought this for my 16 lb Mini Schnauzer for a flight from Oklahoma to Washington. It was perfect!
"my dog loves this toy. she would chew on it until she falls asleep!!! wherever she goes, her dino goes! she loves her dino!"
"As a new dog owner, this tool was suggested to me to de-matt and clean up the long coat of my rescue dog. It is wonderful at thinning the coat and removing hair before it sheds. Use a gentle hand with this tool. Successful results on Bermese Mt dogs, Goldens, Wheaton Terrier Mix, etc."
"I got this a while ago,I'm still using it as my dogs primary leash.It is very well made,lasts forever."
"I bought the snuggle safe disc for my hedgehog to keep her from getting cold. We were using an electric heating mat, but there are setbacks using electricity. I really like the simplicity of the snugglesafe. Pop it in the microwave for a couple of minutes and flip over for a couple more. The cover is quality material and the velcro is nice. The price is right. My only complaint with the product is it only seems to stay warm for 6-8 hrs. vs. the 12 it says. This could be due to operator error. The directions are per microwave wattage and I don't know what our's is but you can't over heat the disc, so possibly I underheat it. The hedgehog has not however gone into hibernation so all is good."
"I bought this on Amazon when it was $29.99 with Prime. (Check the other listings for the same litter box, some might have a lower price.)I'm one of the most skeptical person you'd ever meet, so I was hesitant on buying this. I watched videos to understand how it works and took the leap. I don't regret it! A few notes:- Definitely get the large size unless you have a VERY small cat that's almost kitten sized.. your cat will appreciate the room! My cat is a Siamese mix and is on the large side and can't maneuver around the box much.- As far as litter leaking out when you roll it"
"The Bengal does not like this but the other 2 cats do. That's why I left a 4 star rating. The other two like it ok, but they all prefer the tuna flavor--natch!"
We used the product for a recent car trip from Arizona to Washington. We had our two cats in it and it worked out perfectly. It was very convenient for taking it in and out of the car at the hotel. It is very easy to break down for storage in the carrying case.Great product !!
"I gave it a four star rating because...I have to say I was a little disappointed that it didn't fit all the way across in my Highlander...which by the way is not a large SUV. It should not be advertised for an SUV. I also should have taken measurements, but I went with the SUV phrase. Other than that, I like how thick it is and it appears to be fairly durable. We will put it to the test next month when we get our new puppy. I will also get him a cushioned bed mat to give him some cushion. It appears that it will be a good waterproof barrier for little accidents. I like the ideas that other reviews did with the mat"
"Bought this product because my cat wouldn't stop peeing on probably the most annoying place in the house--the couch. Followed the directions, sprayed the couch a lot, let it dry. It actually made the problem WORSE, she went on it an hour or two after spraying and has kept going on it with higher frequency than before I used the product. Avoid at all costs; does not work as advised and instead makes the problem worse."
"this pump head is an awesome buy it is whisper quiet and incredibly powerful would definitely buy more. I give this thing five stars, its quiet efficient and when you plug it in its so quiet that you never know it's on.there's no knocking noise here unlike pumps from others... great product"
Like the other 1 star review my puppy (6 Months) chewed the handle off minutes after unpacking. I did not write to the company. I just found toys that last much longer locally so I could check the durability of a toy before I bought it. Kong (the original) and Nylabone last the best for aggressive chewers.
"This may well be the best travel crate buy on the market. The large 1/4 inch size Allen Head bolts that hold the two halfs together are Massive and large in number (unlike some of the cheap plastic snap-and-twist setups other manufactures use). The front door is the easiest to open and close of any we have purchased, which includes Remington, Foster&Smith;, Vari Kennel to name a few.The only unknown is the toughness of the plastic shell, which is well designed in shape; however, the strength of the plastic is still on unknown at this point. Without a drop/load test, I'll have to let time answer that part. If the plastic, is indeed, a relatively high strength material (with regard to cracking/tearing/heat deformation, etc), then I would rate the crate a 5_+ !!URGENT UPDATE"
The Midwest icrtae double door metal dog crate is a good value. The quality is good. Easy to assemble and easy to store.
"Purchased for our Chihuahua, I really like the quality of this little coat. Excellent bargain! I think she will be quite warm in it on cold winter days."
"I'll be short and to the point. This litter box does a wonderful job of taking all of the hassle out of owning a cat. As advertised the litter tray lasts around 22-28 days for my one cat. I was amazed at how well odors where limited and how clean the box smelled even after all that time. I think we could have gone another week on the tray but we changed it anyways just to be on the safe side.My cat had little trouble getting used to the new system and now eagerly watches it scoop her waste away. I would highly recommed this to any cat owner as the actual cost isn't really that much more than traditional litter and its a whole lot less work. I do recommend getting the extra canopy top for the unit and the large econ-o pack of litter trays.Again overall, excellent product that works as advertised. I was scepticle going into it and all the positive reviews swayed my decision. I'm glad I made the purchse."
"This is unsafe, fell apart with in 2 days. Do not buy this for your pet. Very sorry I got this."
"Unfortunately, you can't believe the picture on the staywell box. Border Collies and English Springer Spaniels do not easily fit through the door flap ...unless they are on the very small & skinny side. Picture a contortionist going through a small opening because that's exactly how a 35lb dog will look going through the door flap - they fit but only just and with some work to get through. If the dog weighs any more than that, good luck making them squeeze through the narrow opening.The flap is made out of plastic and has a cheap plastic ""rod"" system that supposedly holds the door flap in place. Two days later and the plastic is broken. Definitely not worth your money. We tried the larger, too, and had the same issue ...big enough for our dog, but broke within a short-time after installation."
"The product is well made, soft, but like any dog bed it is not very cushioned on the bottom. Overall I like it but if it had more padding on the bottom that would be great.I would personally not recommend it for a large dog, but for small ones is works great."
"Fabulous toy that solves the issue of stuffing, plastic and rubbish in the back yard from broken dog toys. Doesn't hurt dog or handler. This is my second version of this dog toy in our house. The other was simply worn out."
"I love it! after spending years picking up poop by hand (with a bag), I finally can stop bending over. it's easy to use, and the perfect length for me. it might be a little short for a tall person."
"My dogs have transitioned to a Vegetarian diet. I started with Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula (dry and canned) - initially, I mixed it in with their ""old"" food (Wellness Lamb & Rice). After about 2 weeks, they were eating only Natural Balance Vegetarian/Vegan dog food. I eventually also started to feed them V-Dog. I now feed them a mixture of Natural Balance Vegetarian and V-dog food. Since they stopped eating the meat byproducts (i.e. slaughterhouse waste), they no longer have upset stomachs and diarrhea (not to mention gas and runny poop), and their skin issues have gone away. I would highly recommend Natural Balance Vegetarian/Vegan formula."
Girlfriends cats have not been back in room to continue ruining my Persian rug since I got it!
"Thank GOD for this invention! .I put this device on the roof rack of my jeep every night and ""bang"", no more cats sleeping on top of my sunroof.Perfect roof saver !"
"It stings and cats don't like anything being put into their ears. But c'mon, they're cats. Still this stuff kills the mites AND helps clean out the gunk the mites leave behind. Pretty sweet.I treat kitties on my back porch by first securely wrapping the cat in a towel. Treating one ear at a time, I apply a good portion of the gel in the ear and then gently massage the base of the ear to ensure good distribution. Finally, I release the cat and let him or her shake out the excess gel along with any earmite gunk the medicine breaks loose.There is usually no sign of excess gel by the next day. Just be sure to apply every few days, as per the instructions, until the mites are completely gone."
"Scoop-free really does keep itself clean. There's NO scooping, NO cleaning! The boxes seem to work for about a month for 1 1/4 cats, (We have one indoor cat that uses it all the time, and one outdoor cat that uses it occassionally.) With the hood attachment and the litter mat, there are no litter messes all over the floor. With the hood, all the litter stays in the box, where it belongs. I've had other so-called self-cleaning litter boxes that were a weekly chore and mess to clean, inside, outside,everywhere. Scoop-free is the REAL DEAL! Only thing is, the bright purple cover doesn't really go with my decor. But you can't have everything, I guess. It's a small price to pay for a clean litterbox! And my cat loves it, too!"
"This is great! I mean, it looks like a fake plant, but when it comes to having this or a litter box in the middle of your room, this is wonderful! I have recommended it to other cat owners."
"Couldn't be happier with this purchase for our new puppy. It's so easy to take up and down so traveling with it is a breeze plus we leave it set up in our home so our pup has a safe place to sleep and play when he's not with us. The pen is very well made and has been worth every penny we paid for it. Since our dog is very small, I'm sure we'll be using it for many months to come."

"Our pitbull got one of these the other night. She LOVES it, but after a few hours of play, it's already missing chunks."
good for the price got this for our puppy to keep her warm in the cold NY winters. dont use it much now that he has grown and has her full husky fur
"This item was received poorly packaged and a bit dusty....a turn off for me for sure. Unfortunately I had ordered two based on previous reviews. They apparently had been on the store shelf for a while...not a good sign, and I had to wash them off in hot soapy water. They are not as bright and red as shown and are extremely hard and not bouncy. I am disappointed in this item."
"When the package arrived, I opened the packing box only to discover the Petmate Ultra Bubbler box had been opened as well. Fortunately all the parts were there and the contents didn't seem disturbed so I didn't take off any stars.The unit itself works fine. Setup is a breeze and the tank is easy to fill. One word of advice"
"We got two puppies for xmas and it works great. Really easy to put together, the puppies just love it they go right in."
"He loves these treats! I put them into his various puzzle toys and they are small enough to come out when he pushes the toy around, but not too small that they pour out without any interaction on his part. We also use these treats in training our ""still puppy"" Alex (1y 6mo). He might be full sized, but he loves fun and games. These treats are an integral part of his daily fun."
"Took a bit longer than expected to get them (about a week more), but had plenty on hand so there was no hurry. The filters work fine."
"I bought this product thinking it would get rid of fleas on my dog, instead it did the opposite. I used it and saw that it draws fleas to your pet and then sterilizes them, not kill them. So it uses your pet as bait to get the fleas and then the fleas die after a few days, but this does not stop the fleas from biting your pet. So this was not a great product and the reviews never mentioned this. So I was not happy with this product and will never purchase this again."
This bowl is just great. It works as advertised and I no longer have to worry about spilling water on the interior of my car. Excellent product.
"With reasonable expectations you should be pleased with this product. Our wire-haired fox terrier always has to ""have the last bark"" with neighboring dogs (typical stubborn, willful terrier traits) -- this behavior has dramatically improved. The device works well within these paramaters:1) For our yard configuration, it's a ""line of sight"" type of device -- depending on the size of your yard, it may not impact your neighbor's dogs, random wandering bands of dogs, or your own dog if s/he is too far away (such as around the other side of the house). It has a very long cord, so I move it around every week or so, and the dog hasn't figured it out.2) It doesn't stop barking, it interrupts a barking sequence -- for it to work, you dog has to be repeatedly barking. It appears to distract the dog, taking the steam out of the barking episode. The device doesn't prevent all barking, and the dog has to get going on a string of repeated barks for impact. But, it does interrupt the cycle, and shorten the cycles for my dog. She may bark once or twice, then kind of give up - she has a weird ""half bark"" when the tone goes off, and then it's pretty much over.3) It doesn't put a big dent in ""barking for a cause"" - such as a brazen cat wandering along the fence top, taunting the dog. When there's a good reason (in dog logic) to bark vigorously, my dog is unphased by the device, initially. She does seem loose interest in the barking sooner, though.All in all, happy with the purchase, and would recommend.Update February 2013 -- still working! Dog woke me up at 5 am barking (a rarity now), but again, 4-5 barks at a time, then she basically gives up. Very happy with this result for my dog/yard combination!"
"I bought this deshedding tool to help me groom our miniature Australian Shepherd. I've been using just a normal brush for six years and have been bringing her twice a year for a professional grooming, where I would request the ""furminator"" treatment. When I heard about the furminator tool, I realized this could eliminate the need to pay for the furminator treatments at the groomer's...and this turned out to be true. Our dog does not mind the furminator tool (although it takes two people - one to hold her and one to brush) and the amount of fur from her undercoat that comes out is quite amazing."
"He loves looking out the window, now he can just sit and watch out the window and be safely harness in his chair. He sleeps well on long trips and I don't have to worry about him falling out of the seat."
"Our dog, a mixed lab and chow (75lbs) did not even know what to do with this! We put all kinds of food -- peanut butter, cheese, steak, etc. but he could not get any of these out of the small hole. And our dog is quite strong! It is a waste of money."
"My cat got a nasty case of tapeworms, and these tablets cleared it up in one pill! Only gave it four stars instead of five because it doesn't really give you directions about dosage on the package, but I found it elsewhere on the internet. Anyway, this seller was great, got the tabs pretty quick, and they were sooo much cheaper than the same tabs at PetSmart! Definitely recommend!"
"Our golden retriever absolutely loves this!We bought it because we were on a road trip to the ocean and he loves to fetch in the water. He couldn't get enough of this ball! Here are some of the highlights:-It whistles when thrown, which keeps his attention for hours.-It is bright and easy to find even in low light.-It floats, which provides endless fetching possibilities.When I first bought it I doubted its toughness because the rubber feels very light and flexible, but it has held up extremely well. Our dog carries it with him everywhere and chomps on it regularly. I don't expect it to last forever or be indestructible, but when he finally wears it out I will be buying another in 3-pack form!"
"just as described my pupppy loves her bed, but we thought we were getting grey not cinnamon, its kinda retro, but my dog doesnt care, just my wife. all of the items had the same color picture, but had a small color indicator at the top I had looked at so many by the time I ordered it I had no idea what i was doing... oh well, at least its not the fake wool one."
"We have three indoor cats, all quite different in temper. None of them is particularly interested in these springs. When I had first unwrapped them, they would play with them for about 1 minute and then two of my cats lost interest for good. The third one occasionally chases one around but that doesn't last but a few seconds. So not really a winner with my cats.I am also not quite sure how safe these springs really are. The ends are quite unfinished, not rounded off, i.e. they could potentially be harmful. If a cat really stretched one of these I can see how it snapping back into its original shape could cause injury as they do tend to ""jump around"" unpredictably (the springs, not the cats), especially on a smooth floor such as hardwood. The one cat that does tackle a spring every once in a while likes to hold one end between its paws and gnaw on the other while pulling on it with its teeth. This makes me feel very uneasy as I am afraid it could harm him, especially his eyes, when springing back. I think there are safer and more fun toys out there than these."
"I also have this fountian in black. I get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part. I agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty. The filters do not seem to last very long either. I have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke. Now I am attempting to find a motor to replace this one. I do not reccommend this color at all! The fountian has been fine until now, but it shouldn't of broke down already!"
Not very strudy but it's just OK since it wasn't expensive but I doubt it would have lasted the winter int he northeast here.
My sister's dog loves these and I was a little hestitant buying this product from Amazon because some of the reviews said they found little white worms in the packaging or the inside the greenies bag or box. But I've ordered them off here a few times and never had any issues. And they do help keep the dogs breath fresh.
"I bought this based on the reviews of how durable it was. Needless to say, my two beagles tore it open very quickly (apparently they found the weak point where the replacement squeaker is inserted), tore the eyes off, etc.. until they ended up with a lifeless shell. On the plus side, the shell of the frog lasted quite a while until it was torn into pieces :) Overall good if you have destructive dogs and only are looking for a couple days worth of constant play."
"I have a cat who loves sitting on the back of an armchair to look out the back window - hence, the chair gets covered in cat fur. Like other reviewers here, I found myself going through a ton of lint rollers to stay on top of things, so I purchased this product hoping for an alternative cleaning method. I don't know if it's how fine my cat's fur is or if it's the texture of the armchair or if it's the product, itself, but it has been less-than-useful in cleaning. The fur doesn't stick really well to the brush and then, because of the static, it's tough to pull off - I feel like I end up with just as much fur on me and in the air and I have to go over the chair a dozen times. I have officially retired this product and bought a vacuum cleaner with an upholstery attachment - much better! For grooming the cat, I have a FURminator and really love it, almost as much as the cat does."
"I sent this to my daughter...No she's not a dog; she has a dog, which makes me a Grand-ma, kinda. Well, I don't know what scent you spray on your product but as soon as the package arrived--before it was opened-- my 'grandson' went wild. He loves all of his outerwear but this stylish coat makes him so happy. He's a clothes whore like his Mom and Dad. The fit is perfect and when you pop the collar he looks like Ashton Kutcher or Will Smith. The shipping date was swift and the garment was as described. Good job, kudos to the designer and the production team! This product has a lot of whimsy yet it isn't foolish. It is functional but not too boring; a classic look that easily transitions from office wear to an early night on the town. OK--that's enough!Again, we love it and I want to recommend it but I selfishly I want my 'grandson' to be the coolest kid on the block--and the envy of all the dogs at the park."
"I have an old beagle who decided in her dotage that she would bark when ever she didn't get her way, she was becoming intolerable, barking at all hours of the night, disturbing everyone around. She is extremely fragile, with a heart condition, and I felt a shock collar could kill her. I will admit I was very skeptical about this spray collar but I was desperate, anyone who has owned a beagle will know that they are difficult at best to train.So I tried the collar, and I am very happy to report it works, Tallys barking has returned to its normal level,which was infrequent, it happened quickly, within a few days, we followed the directions on the box, which are very important, and had good results. I can't promise this will work for every dog, but it worked well for ours,without resorting to shocks. I don't think you can just hang this collar on your dog and expect it to work, although I do ocassionaly with Tally to refresh her training, I feel it is very important to do the training outlined in the instructions, and you will get results fairly quickly. I am quite satisfied with this product."
"I am one of those people who never really spend money on pet beds and always get the cheap ones at dollar stores for a MAX of $20. I always think &#34;my dog loves just sleeping on a towel, will he really care if I spend more on a &#34;quality&#34; bed&#34;. I finally decided I'd do all the research on pricey beds- form memory foam, to special zippable/washable wraps around waterproofing, I checked it all up to the $200 range. I wanted something soft, supportive, attractive, and priced reasonably for quality. I ended up getting this bed because it really seemed to still be on the cheaper side of beds, and gave me a big bed for the money. When I received it, I was AMAZED!!!! This bed is SO soft, and firmly stuffed so the bed won't go flat, looks beautiful, and my dogs LOVE IT!!! I was shocked to see how much they actually enjoy this bed and are in it all the time. They LOVE the doughnut edge so they can flop over on their backs but still be nestled in the comfy side. They also love to push toys into the crack on the side and dig for it, and the bed doesn't show a scratch or tear.I have a bassett hound and a sheltie, and I ordered the large size bed and they have a good amount of extra room (but they love it like that). Anyone with a bassett knows that the bed is really hers, so I'm ordering a second one for my sheltie. :)Great quality, great product, this is a steal for the price!!!"
"This product is a good product, as I have had the entire system with two dogs for going on 5 years now. The new units, however are not as good as the old units. If you have old collar straps, keep them, as the new strap seems flimsy. The unit still works fine, but I just like the original strap better. Had a metal buckle and was a much stronger plastic. The new collar is a stretchable material, which I would not trust. The original collars don't seem to go bad, but I will bet that the new ones will not last as well.The dogs respond well to the system, and once trained they know where they can and cannot go. They know that the warning beep means that they only have seconds to get back where they belong, before they get zapped. My big girl almost was nit with a bus, so this is definitely a more human way of keeping them safe than a chain. Once they are taught, the tone sends them packing, w/o the need for electric shock. I just started leaving the collar on loose, so the unit was not actually touching them, and they were fine. HOWEVER. They are smart, so do not think that they will not test the system. We left the collar off a few weeks, and caught our pups roaming. I re-trained both of them and they are now again, fine. No roaming, no getting killed on the road...... I lost a collar, so this was a replacement. These can be sent back to the manufacturer, since they are a lifetime replacement, for significantly less than purchasing them outright. So if it dies, send it back, just make sure you remove your straps before you do!"
"I have a 15 lbs. pug and he has tried to get himself out of this. Nothing too crazy but he gives an honest try. He has now learned that it is not going to happen. And it is very easy to fold up and throw in the trunk of my car. I put a blanket in the bottom so that it is more comfortable. Oh, and the double door is awesome! I will move it around the house if I need him to not be walking around but still see me, so it really helps to be able to place it with the double doors."
"Our obnoxious Sealyham LOVES these, she absolutely goes crazy over them. It's one of the few times we see her actually move like a terrier. I guess they're supposed to be good for teeth,,,,,which is a plus. I have no idea what it is about them that makes her so wild,,,,but it is pretty humorous."
"I must have very sensitive ears, because the Rena 300 sounded like a truck running. The tank is in my son room which is on the other side of the house; down a long hallway, past a bathroom no where near my room and I could hear that pump Buzzing away. By 2am I con't take the noise anymore & had to unplug it, and when I did my son said ""don't ever plug it back in!""I bought 6 different air pump (ranging from $14 to $50) and I learned they ALL make noise, there no such thing a silent & quiet air pump. I con't take any of the Rena (I tried the rena 100, 200 & 300), and I tired the Tetra 10 & 40 they too where way too noisy. But the Tertra whisper 60 surprisingly, was quiet enough where we could sleep. I think it all depends on what your ears can take; I say buy couple different sizes & brands till you find the one your ears likes."
A very simple device that removes the mat quickly. A must have for long haired dogs or any dogs who are prone to matting.
"My small dogs are always so excited to go on walks, they often choke and cough and gag themselves 'pulling' ahead on a regular collar & lead. The head collar is perfect! Honestly - Every dog owner should own & use this product!!"
"We had to go on a weekend trip and my cat didn't have a sitter so thankfully these arrived on time and we didn't have to take him to ""pet-care"" for the weekend. It stayed fresh cool and clean until we could arrive home."
This is the perfect little comb for combing my soft coated West Highland White Terrier. Keeps her fur from matting & tangling.
This product helps you dog with digestion.It allows the dog to use more food and digest more food rather than eliminate it and get very little nutrition. This maximizes their intake.
"Was very careful when using, as I read a few reviews stating scratched glass. After a few cleanings avoiding the gravel bottom without any signs of scratching, I decided to try it. I was slow and often released the magnet to see if any pieces had worked their way in-between, none ever did. I even used the magnet to clean under the gravel layer, again being cautious, but not one scratch. I use the common gravel one can purchase at Walmart, I suppose if there was a sand bottom or smaller particles it could cause major problems, but in my trials I have yet to see a scratch."
"The Litter Robot arrived in a giant box, which was my first surprise. I don't know what I was expecting, but the machine is very large and resembles a tiny cement mixer or a gargantuan webcam. In any case, it was very easy to remove from the box and to assemble.Once I had it together and was ready to add the litter, I found that it was almost impossible to add it from the box into the cat entrance. Eventually I read the instructions and discovered there are two other holes and a ""Fill"" button to position them for pouring. They've thought of everything!I left the old litter box in there next to it (without scooping, since I figured it should be the less appealing of the choices). When I checked the drawer to see if anything had made its way down there, I was gratified to see that at least one of my three cats was using it. From the amount of clumps in the drawer, I suspect (and hope) that two cats are using it. The third cat leaves occasional surprises just outside the laundry room door, but I'm not yet sure which cat it is. I've eliminated one from suspicion, since I've seen him in there on two different occasions. So at least it's narrowed down.I guess I will have to try closing all three cats in the laundry room with the Robot and lots of food for a day or so and see if the mystery cat gets the hint or learns by example. Aside from that little glitch, which is not a product flaw but a scaredy-cat issue, I have to say that the Litter Robot was absolutely worth the price. I've been through two Litter-Maids; the first one got its wire caught in the rake and snapped. The second one just stopped dead for no reason after a month.The Litter Robot has made my least-favorite task a lot less disgusting. Hooray!!"
"We have been using Frontline Plus for a couple years now and have never had a flea problem. The only down side was with two dogs it seemed like we were spending a fortune on their monthly dosing. That is until I read that the formulation between this pack and the small breed pack are the same just in different quantities. Now what we do is buy this 3-pack, bought a glass vial with dropper, measured out the proper dosage for our size dog and marked the dropper, then pour the big dog Frontline vial into our glass vial and store the extra for the following months. This saves a ton with multiple dogs and they still get the same great protection. Now I am not a veterinarian and therefore please do your own research to ensure proper dosing and if this is a practice that will work for you. I in no way want any pups to be harmed trying to use this method incorrectly."
"This is not a bad product overall; however, describing it as large is very misleading. It is tiny; maybe ok for a dog under 16 lbs but that's it. As the result, we could only use it for 2 weeks before our puppy grew out of it. Also, the handle is attached loosely and comes off easily which makes it hard to carry."
This product works pretty well for my high energy dog. I take her running next to my bike and she doesn't pull nearly as much.
"Ordered this for my husky. Contemplated buying one of the ""high dollar"" ones, but after reading the reviews for this one, it works great. I would definately recommend."
"Was pleasantly surprised by this product. After installation, leaked for maybe a minute before it ceased. Haven't noticed a drop since then and our chinchilla has no problem using this, even though the size of the ball is much larger than the one we were previously using."
"helps my cat get around better, now she is back to annoying me :)"
"We received the order very quickly, much faster than expected. Pepper loves these cookies and they are her favorite, she will do pretty much anything to get one. They are nice sized, don't fall apart and are in cute shapes."
"I have some hard core chewers, and I have always used chew hooves to help them satisfy their chewing urges. This is the best deal I have found in years of searching on line. They are large hooves, and much heavier than others I have received from other companies. I am very happy with this purchase and I will definately be looking to purchase more of these."
"I bought this three years ago, no problem, nill. I LOVE IT!! It came with specific instructions on setup and detailed instructions for training. Those who don't love it, either didn't follow the directions or didn't follow through with the training, both of which take time and commitment. I even trained my friends' dogs on it with extra collars I keep around, so their dogs wouldn't dig in my flowers. I have had to replace the batteries in the collars only once in the three years. I got it because one of my dogs was a jumper...but no more. You'll love it, I promise."
This is a lovely pen but I also had problems with the plastic connectors. One of them is stuck and won't open so I can't open the pen to let the dog in. I would have to lift a 65lb dog over it.I called General Cage customer service to see if I could have it repaired or get a new connector and have it repaired myself. They told me that they no longer carry any parts because everything is made in ..................China! And they don't repair because everything is made in...........China! So too bad for the customer. As far as they were concerned it was my tough luck and I would just have to buy another. These are way to expensive to replace so often. Look for something that is made in the USA and has replacement parts available. General Cage is not what it used to be and is certainly not a Green company!
"The cats will stop at nothing to get at this thing. They will leap as high as they can without thinking colliding into walls, furniture, guitars, each other.I had to learn how to be careful with this thing so they don't kill themselves."
I've had these batteries in my dogs collar and they have worked just fine as far as I can tell. He hasn't escaped at all with his collar on!
"I read the reviews before this purchase, so I hold the scoop toward the bottom. I can see the seam where the scoop can break if held high on the handle or if scooping tons of litter at one time. The small grate of the scoop is the best for the tiny clumps other scoops not do remove. I want this scoop to last, so I use three instruments for cleaning the litter box. I start with a cheap plastic putty knife to scrap the bottom of the litter box, then I use a regular cheap scoop and this scoop I use a couple of times a week to remove the fine clumps. Seems like a lot of work, but it keeps the boxes nice and clean. I have four cats and six litter boxes. I keep the scoops in a plastice container. I am happy with the scoop."
"I bought two of these in different styles and they each arrived the same day and they each kept our 5 cats entertained for about 2 days. Then, they went back to their catnip filled, faux, furry mice and the mylar tinsel balls and the plastic balls with bells in them. The Turbos' now sit collecting dust and once in a while Dinkie, the Maine Coon/Tabby mix, will put a big paw under the ball and flip it out of the track and chase it :)"
I've never been able to find a good brush or comb for my cats until now. The FURminator is awesome! It causes static and the hair kinda goes everywhere so I can't wait till it gets warmer outside so I can use it more. Great purchase!!!
I love this scratching post.. I have scratch pads all over house and one of my kitties still was using rug and couch.. This post is really made for adult cats.. right size.. usually they are to small. This one is awesome.. I put cat nip on first time and since then Cat loves it.. No more scratching couch or rug.. yay..
"This product continues to help my 7 year old lab with being more flexible. Before she started this product (which I first recvd from a vet at an unbelievable expensive price)she had trouble jumping into the car, the bed, the couch and even standing from a laying down position. Now you would never know she had problems."
The price is ridiculously cheap and my cat loves this toy. Take a chance. I don't think you'll be sorry.
"I bought this for my cats, in case they find themselves outside during poor weather. I placed it close to the front door of the house so that they could run in fast if it was raining. (That was my reasoning, anyway - animals always seem to have their own plans.) I don't know if they hang out in it, but I do know that when I placed each one in it, he/she did not immediately run out, but stayed long enough to sniff around (the cedar smells great). I assume that they know it belongs to them.The little house is attractive, well built, and easily put together in a few minutes with a Phillips screwdriver.I took the time to make a few improvements, which may or may not be necessary, depending on where you live. To protect the house from the harsh sun, sand, and termites here in north Florida, I built a 4' x 4' pallet of pressure treated lumber to get it off the ground, which also provides a small porch for sunning and keeps water from splashing in from the ground. I gave it a coating of Behr's (from Home Depot) on the outside, to make it that much more weather resistant. I cut to size (with a utility knife) a piece of insulation board for the floor of the house, because the slats there are not air tight and would let in cold air - definitely something a cat would reject. Finally, I faced the door to the southeast, for shelter against the cold north air, and nailed a piece of exterior/interior carpeting with a slit in it to the inside of the door.Another possibility is to line the inside with a reflective coating of some kind, perhaps one of those camping emergency blankets, or insulation that has a reflective surface.I put in a round, padded cat bed with a hood (that the cats were already familiar with), in the back corner away from the door. There is enough room inside for two cats to lie down, if they are friendly.All my improvements cost very little in time or money, and I feel assured that my little friends are safely out of the weather when they need to be."
"Got this item from Amazon because it seemed like a really cool idea both a bubbler and LED in one. However, in receiving this product I realized how wrong I was. After setting it up in my 46 gallon bowfront the bubbler immediately stopped working! I read other reviews about just shaking it and it will go back on but that never happened. I contacted Amazon and they sent me another one. I was impressed with the swift sale and the ease of getting a second device. However, after about an hour of working once again the aeration device stopped!!!! For the second time receiving this item it once again broke the day of. I was so disgusted and tried contacting Amazon once again. They still have not gotten back to me about the product and I am still waiting..... I never write reviews about products but this one is sooooo bad I had to just let the public know, DO NOT BUY!!!!! It is more of a headache than anything else. I also think that Amazon even selling a product so unreliable as this one is just destroying their name.... (i wish i could have given it 0 stars but they don't give you that option)"
"About 10 years ago I bought a LitterMaid, and it worked wonderfully. We recently did some remodeling on our house and I decided it was time to get a new litter box. I bought one of the new LitterMaid Elite thinking they had made some improvements over the years and it was probably a much better litter box. What a piece of junk! The metal rake would just smear the used litter across the bottom of the box, the litter would spill through between the box and the used litter tray. I hated it. After a week I went online to see if I could find one of the ""old"" litter boxes, and I did. The plastic rake works so much better than the metal one, the litter doesn't spill through and the used litter actually goes into the receptacle instead of smearing across the bottom of the litter box. Sometimes the original is the best."
This collar surprised me by it's heavy duty quality. It's a nice think braid but very flexible. Better than what I was looking for. A+
If you are wondering if this gate is worth anything i would have to say its worth every penny. I use this gate for my beagle and it works great. Its very easy to install and very strong. the added extensions are a huge bonus for me i needed this because i put it in the hall which is a bit wider than my door.
"This is a very convenient product and a great advancement from the previous product. However, the motor is not strong enough to push large clumps of litter at times and I often need to help the machine remove the waste. With the new design, clumps of waste often get trapped behind the combs. Also with the new design, there is a substantial amout of litter that slips in front of the waste receptacle and onto your floor. On the plus side, the box is larger and the comb is better designed. If you have more than one cat, you will end up burning through the waste receptacles. At over a dollar a pan, this is a very expensive product to have and use."
"My dog started limping, crying in pain, could not jump up on the sofa nor go up or down the stairs to the backyard or stoop to poop. I took him to the vet and he has a nerve root impingment at lumbar spine due to a calcified disc. I was given a prescription for Rimadyl twice daily for the pain and to refill as needed. After a week he was a little better, but still limping, wouldn't get up on the sofa and could barely walk down the street. I did some research on the internet and ran across this and purchased a bottle from Amazon. I can't believe the difference and not that long after starting him on it. He is running around and jumping on the sofa and going up and down the stairs and going on walks again. This stuff works. I wonder why my vet didn't mention it?"
I thought this toy would be made from true tire material. I does not seem to be. My dog had destroyed this tire in a few days. I have bought other tire toys that have lasted for months.
Was a little scared at first because the day after I put the collar on my dog I found two ticks. I think they might have been there before I put the collar on because I have not seen any more since. Tick season is just getting started and I'll be keeping an eye out.
"Our cat loves to sit on the his sill pearch to look outside...in the winter it can get very cold next to the window. With the heated sill, he stays up there much longer.Great product."
I worry a lot of where things are made for our animals today and what they contain..I have no worries with this product..highly recommend
"This is a must-have for any playful cat owner. My cats love this toy box! Just fill it with any small cat toys, they have fun getting them out again. A little sprinkle of catnip keeps them occupied even longer."
I tried many different products but furminator is absolutely the best. I have three different kinds of cats-one being Persian. Furminator worked well on all three cats including the short hair one. You'll be amazed
"This is my first time getting a freshwater testing kit, but I am so glad I got this one. The price is very good compared to other's and it comes with all the levels you need to test. pH, higher pH, nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia testing. Very easy to use as well. Each bottle says how many drops you need and you just fill the water to the line. Shake a little and wait 5 minutes. Very quick and painless. Rinse them out and your good to go again. I highly recommend this kit for anyone who needs to test their fish water."
"This was easy to set up and seems to be well built - and it's made in the USA. I was even able to put the door with the hardware together without having to call the husband. I take it down with ease and put it up when I'm leaving so my little puppy can have a bit of freedom with crate, food & water and still have a place to go potty on a pee pad. I just got my puppy and this has already helped so much with training and I feel lots less guilty when I have to leave her. I am very happy with this play yard. The only little thing I would criticize is that I cannot reach the floor when reaching over the panels -- they are that tall! But that's a good thing because it means my cat won't jump in and harass the pup. If I need better access, I simply pull the rod out of one of the panels, ""open"" the yard, replace the pad or replenish the food & water, and close up the panels. It really is easy to use and sturdy enough for my needs."
"purchased 3 of these. 1 for our cats & two as family pet gifts. They all love this item and enjoy playing. It tires me out as well, but my arms are getting worked at least..."
"I got this to help me groom my rough coat collie, an older dog with arthritis. I used it on him dry. It picks up a lot of hair. Also, he seems to enjoy the massaging action of it."
this medication for the dog was delivered on time and works fine.the company did a fine job.
In the description it says that the tube will also fit 10-20 Whisper models. All LIES because it didn't fit at all! I was so happy because I looked everywhere and couldn't find this extension tube. When I saw it online I decided to spend the extra money to have it. Now I have a worthless $8.00 piece of plastic. Save your money if you don't have a 30 model!
I brushed my cat with the comb I have always used. Next I used the FURminator. I could not believe how much more hair came out. My cat was purring the entire time. I have thrown out the other two combs I used to use. Best money I have ever spent.
Nice bag. Works great. My community had a mutt mitt box that dispensed black bags. I liked those a little better. Look at the picture carefully. It has an extra layer at the bottom. Makes the bag a little more bulky but it does protect your hand from getting dirty.
"We started with Feliway at the recommendation of a vet to calm the addition of two new cats to our home. It has really helped. We had two other cats and the addition of the new new ones was a little stressful. They have all adjusted nicely, and with the addition of the Feliway, they came around very quickly."
"I was hesitant to purchase because some people said it leaked, but my bottle has never leaked even when thrown around in my bag. The plastic/rubber ""bowl"" is very thick so you need two hands to flip it out and that can be a little annoying, but once it's flipped the bottle works like a charm. I would purchase this again."
my cat has to take pills every day for the rest of his life. Greenies pill pockets are the best. my cat in not finicky and will eat almost anything but getting your pet to take pills isnt easy. this product has saved us both stress and hassle. he loves pill time.
"We have a medium size dog who loves to chew. We were looking for a long lasting treat that could keep him occupied for hours and tried the everlasting dog treat ball. I inserted the treat into the toy and gave it to him as soon as it arrived to see how long it would really last. At first it seemed like it was going to work great, but within 15 minutes he had mastered the art of removing treats from the toy and had chomped through half the treat. Once he figured it out the first time, he could remove additional new treats in a minute or two. We went to whole foods and bought 6 bones for the same price as one of these treats; its been an hour and he is still working on the first one."
"Was a great clipper in the beginning, but it only lasted for about 1 1/2 years. The performance became weaker, and finally it wouldn't turn on anymore. I only used it about every 6 weeks, so it wasn't heavy use. Looking for sth better now."
this seems to be the only product of its type that works. it is the only one that worked for me. easy to use and a big bottle. i use it at every water change. Seachem internet responce is outstanding.
"I have no idea why any of these reviews would say this light doesn't work, because man does it! I used brand new batteries and the house was pitch black..everything shows up. It took me a few hours to find all of my kittie's spots, and I cleaned them with Nature's Miracle Urine Destroyer. The next morning I woke up, and the house smelled fresh and clean, not even a hint of cat odor. I have never been able to accomplish this before without the light, because there are spots that you just can't find without it. I was shocked by how many spots there were! What a lifesaver!"
"I have big dogs (Irish Wolfhounds) and the Gentle Leader encourages my puller to walk nicely on leash, even when separated from his brother. It gives me peace of mind when walking both dogs by myself that if they should see something and want to chase, I will not lose my grip on them. I have used the Halti in the past on a different dog and liked it. I like the GL a little better because it has fewer straps and doesn't restrict the mouth at all."
My rabbit used this as a bed and a snack. He loved it and it lasted a month before he completely ate it!
"I bought the Cat Mate C10 to be used for a puppy I am getting soon. I currently am using it to give my cat an afternoon snack while I am on a 10 work day. It works just as described. No issues and the delivery from the company offering it was spot on. Now what happens when using it with a puppy, who knows, but it does work with a cat."
"I purchased the Emperor 280 after having problems with my Penguin 150 on my 16 gallon bow front saltwater fish tank. The Penguin's impeller got messed up by sand getting in and grinding the metal away until it was extremely loud and eventually stopped working at all. Since the replacement part for that filter was 80% of the purchase price of that filter I decided that rather than keep messing with that I would upgrade to the Emperor 280. I was not disappointed at all. This is an excellent filter. The bio-wheel is much larger than on the Penguin, and since it pumps water directly onto the wheel itself to keep it running, it's far more effective too. It's a great filter. Lots of power and high flow, it assists my powerhead with a big boost in water movement, which is a must in a reef tank with corals. The person whose review said there is too much flow for their tank must want a tank without any movement at all, where the fish can lazily just float around without any exercise at all. Anyone with any experience in saltwater tanks will tell you, more water flow is better (up to a point, you don't want a raging torrent in your tank). HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILTER TO ANYONE WITH A SALTWATER TANK UP TO 50 GALLONS WHO ISN'T RUNNING A SUMP OR CANISTER FILTER."
"When I first got this in the mail, I was a little worried when I saw the sharp edge of it. However, when I tried it on my cat, she LOVED it! Whenever I bring it out to groom her, she rubs her face against it and purrs. This does remove as much fur as it says it does. My cat has short, very soft fur, and I was amazed at how much of her undercoat came off. I would absolutely recommend this to any pet owner!"
My African Grey Parrot has been eating Lafeber's Premium Daily Diet for Parrotsfor years and has a truly gorgeous plumage that is admired by all our visitors. The deal at Amazon was excellent.
the inline heater works great and keeps temp.it's quiet and runs with no problems.I would recommend this heater to anyone
"I have a 3 yr old Doxie...new to me...so needed to purchase a few things for her,one being this bolster bed for her 'pop-up crate' Its not quite as big as I hadwanted (no fault of the manufactures, its me...should of measured better!) buteven with being a bit smaller, my dog went right to it and laid on it with nobegging on my behalf =) Its soft, has that kind of fleecy knobby fabric and itswashable and dry-able...a WIN WIN in my book! I will put a few little blanketsin (dollar store baby blankets) to make it nicer for her...but all in all thiswas a great purchase and about 6.00 less than in a big box store."
My dog used to wake up in the morning an shake around in is crate really early in the AM. This crate makes no noise when he does this so he does not wake us up. He goes back to sleep till we get up. As an added benefit it's really light and won't damage your house or car when moving it or pinch your fingers.
"Soft Claws are cheaper than Soft Paws, but are by the same company. I have one cat who fights and these claws keep the other cats safe. Monthly I have to have a couple replaced at a time, but they are worth it. I would not be able to manage the situation without them."
"Our dog is doing great on the Advantix Flea, even though he is outside a lot he has not gotten fleas."
"These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly ""indestructible"" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs. Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily! Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-) In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed"
"It's a 50-50 thing at my house - 1 star from the boys and 5 stars from the girls;)Both my boys are rather large, and don't pay much attention to cardboard scratchers other than to initially mark it. Then they get bored.However, both my girls love to lounge and sleep on these. They prefer it to the flat ones, exact same thing on an incline and suddenly it's very interesting. Cats, eh! LOLWhat I like about these is during travel, I can bring them along so the kits have familiar scratchers and smells.I do find I have to refresh the catnip smell rather frequently, or they lose interest in it as a scratching surface; not so for the chaise lounge and bed aspect though."
I originally purchased the 318 filter for turtles. It didn't work all of the time and couldn't handle 2 turtles. I returned it to the store where the Tetra ReptoFilter was recommended. I'm assuming it's the same one as the one featured here. I love it. I used to clean up the tank every 2 to 3 days with our old filter. With this filter the water is clear with very few skin sheddings floating around. I understand that it didn't work well for fish but I don't have the problem with it hurting the turtles. In fact they really seem to like to swim under the waterfall. I'm really pleased with this product.
"This product is great. Installed easily. My sliding door goes out onto an enclosed screen porch, so I didn't have to screw this into the frame of the door (for security purposes). Without any modifications it stays in place just fine. It's lowered my electricity bills enough to cover the expenses. The cats never got used to the flap so I had to remove it. If you have a sliding door i would reccomend this product."
"I am very happy with this product. First of all,it looks nicer than the average boxy litter box. I have it tucked in a corner of the room.Secondly, there is NO smell in the room from the litter. It does a great job of containing odors.Thirdly, I have less vaccuuming to do as the littler that gets stuck in my cat's paws, is dropped into the steps as he exits the dome.I did not like the plastic liner that came with it. My cat got it all bunched up as he dug and I ended up removing it. It was alos hard to clean out properly with the ill fitting plastic liner in it. I now use is without a liner and all is good.Great design, great product."
"Our dogs love these balls! We bought an 8 inch ball and they went crazy the moment we put it down. We recently bought a 10 inch ball too. Our shepherd/husky usually prefers his Busy Buddy to the many toys our spoiled rotten dogs have. He plays with the ball for a good while at least once or twice a day. He likes to chase it around the entire house. You can hear him banging and rolling it all over the place. Considering he's pretty much a one toy dog, I'm impressed that he has taken this much interest in it.Our lab/shepherd can't get enough of it. She is a hard chewer and managed to put a small gash in it on the second day. So we remind her to ""be nice"" when we hear her going at it. She must have learned to play nice since we hardly have to remind her anymore and the ball is holding up well. She spends most of her time trying to figure out how to get the little ball out of the bigger ball. She has gotten her nose stuck in the holes of the 8 inch ball twice so we put them away when we are not home. I recommend supervised play until you are sure how your dog(s) will play with this toy.I just brought home the 10 inch ball this week. Both of them roll it around a bit, but they seem to prefer the smaller one. I was hoping my girl would like the bigger one better so we don't have to worry about stuck noses. In all, I am very happy with my purchases."
These are THE BEST! And they float! Virtually indestructible. But don't tget the one with a rope-that is easily destroyed.
"Did nothing for my pomeranian. The first time I used it she tilted her head and looked like ""what was that?"". I used it again the next day when I caught her chewing the furniture and she didn't respond at all. It may work well for some but not for my dog."
I've had this for 6 or 7 years now and have been using my clippers at least twice a week during that time. I always oil my clippers and I still have a lot of this oil left over.
"I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag. Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a ""hot spot"" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an ""allergic reaction."" Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.******** UPDATED 10/2/08 "
Haven't cleaned the glass in my tank for awhile since my last scrubber broke. This one worked great! I had the whole tank cleaned in mins.
"My Dachshund devoured the treat in about 3 minutes flat. Now she seems like she isn't feeling well and I'm going to take her to the vet because I think it may have given her a bowel impaction. Great. Don't get these, please. I got them at a feed store thinking it would keep her entertained for a while.. nope. Just made her sick. I think I paid like $17 for the ball and a package of refills. What a waste."
I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this product. It is big and bright and the dog has loved playing with the stuffed toy.
"my family has used this product with our dogs for years. when my dogs got skunked (by skunks that live on the river bank), i was forced to buy a competing product (nature's miracle) and it was worthless. i was literally counting the hours 'til the local store the sells odormute opened. this product works 100% on skunk spray and or course, lesser odors like urine etc. i was skeptical when i first bought this product a few years ago that a natural enzyme could somehow eat odors, but i'm a true believer at this point. i haven't found, or heard of, any products that can do what this does. highly recommend..."
I purchased this liner for my small SUV in the hope it would protect my car from my dog. Little did I know that was the last thing I needed to be worried about. I purchased bleach spray and the top was not on properly it spilled all over my cargo area. Luckily for me I had my liner in the car. My carpet was saved and the cover was only slightly bleached. This is well worth the money.
"We have two cats and they both refuse to use this product for going #2. Instead, they have taken to doing their business on the new carpet and new couch. While other reviewers have been patient enough to wait it out past 2 months, we're not willing to deal with anymore of these accidents. It's really not designed for two cats since once one cat does their business, you have to be vigilant about cleaning it or the other cat won't use it. Additionally, the little pamphlet that comes with this item makes the process out to be more simple than it is and does not address how to deal with mishaps. Also, like other reviewers have said, once you remove a ring, you cannot put it back on. We do not recommend this product. We have had greater success with using a litter-filled bowl inserted into the toilet."
"Product arrived as quickly as can be expected, since it was coming from Australia. A++ price and quality."
"Used to be able to get these at Costco but they have quit carrying them, at least in my area. My dogs love them and we use them for their bath treats. Consequently, they put up with their weekly baths very well just to get a few of these. Knowing that they are good for them makes it a win-win."
"I was actually a little hesitant to purchase this particular storage bin based on a few reviews that it was difficult to open. It's not...if you only turn it until it stops. There is a rubber seal around the top that grabs on once it gets to the point where it stops. I only had one issue opening it and it was after the first time I closed it and thought I would be superwoman and make sure that baby was closed! Bad idea. It did stick. It did take some considerable force to open it. So I just turned it till it stopped and realized that the rubber seal did it's job whether I twisted lightly or made things more difficult for myself by trying to close it super tight.We keep our food inside, but we have had a problem with ants in the past (not just where we keep the dog food, either). This keeps the food safe and very fresh. I didn't have a full bag to put in when we got it, but I put about 3/4 of a 17lb bag of food in there and it filled it just about half way. I'm not sure how comfortable a 40lb bag will fit, so I suppose that might be an issue for folks who have to buy in bulk, but the 60lb holder is really just a few dollars extra so if you're worried about your food fitting in, I'd just spring for that one. I also haven't stacked them because I don't need another one.Bottom line, this thing is awesome! If you have a dog or a cat and you don't like to store their food in a bag, this is perfect. It's not unsightly, it's easy to use (if you don't try to close it super tight!), and it keeps your food fresh and pest free...and PET free--no more doggies or kitties sneaking in to the bags!"
"My Lab loves them, but I heard they aren't digestible and so they come out the other end a little funky. Apparently Z Bones are better for dogs and fully digestible."
"I purchased this product about three years ago, and it has just recently stopped working. I looked up the manual online, found a few steps of troubleshooting and after finding no immediate solution, called the manufacturer. I was helped right away, given a link to their web page product support, printed out instructions to try and was treated very courteously by the customer service agent. After disassembling the unit and cleaning it out, I found that a piece of one of the ""eyes"" that control water flow had disintegrated. I then called the manufacturer again to explain my findings and was politely told that they would be able to replace it if I had purchased it within the two-year warranty period. All they would need was proof of purchase. Since I know that I purchased this product well over two years ago, I will be investing in another one. It just simply makes my life easier having it installed. We have two Jack Russell Terriers and a Rhodesian Ridgeback and I never worry that they are out of water.Yes, there were a few times that I found the water bowl that I have sitting beneath it empty. However, I check the bowl at least every other day to make sure there is clean and ample water available, so this has never been a real issue for me. When there has been a problem, I have followed the instruction manual and covered both ""eyes"" on the unit with my hand to see if the batteries needed to be changed. I have only changed the batteries two or three times and have never had any other problems with the unit until now. I highly recommend it."
"We needed to find a better lighting solution for our Turtle tank as sometimes we weren't around to turn his lights on / off.We have his heat & basking bulb plugged into the &#34;day&#34; plugs, and the Water Heater & Filter plugged into the regular plugs.Works great and very consistent. every morning at 8 o clock the light's go on - 12 hours later they turn off, and the extra plugs leave a lot of room for expansion! It also helped us clean up a lot of the extra extension cords and things around the tank. Now we have automatic lights and the tank area looks a lot cleaner and less cluttered.The timer might take some tinkering to get right, but after 10 minutes of playing with it - you'll be an expert."
"This container looks pretty enough, but you're going to be caring for a living creature that needs more room and places to hide.having a bowl or tank that's 1 gallon or larger would make your betta so much happier!"
"I purchased this for my 2 small dogs for use indoors. I was really impressed by the packaging, nothing was broken during shipment because it was packed so tight. It was also really easy to assemble (although I did have some screws left over). My dogs LOVE it."
The Vittles Vault works very well. It has a good seal which helps keep the dog food as fresh as possible. I also like the way the lid screws on - no hinges or clips to break. All in all we feel we received value for our money.
"This doesn't work well with fish tanks. If you look at the picture, there are white plugs (always on), yellow plugs (daytime) and blue plugs (night). The way this works is that you can setup up to 7 times for the daylight plugs to turn on and off. Whenever the daylight plugs are off, the blue plugs are on, and vice versa. So, all you can really do with this is have daytime lights and nightime lights - you cannot have lights that overlap each other."
The vet told us about this shampoo my dog has Atopy and has a lot of skin problems. He is on medication for it but he still sometimes gets flareups so I use different shampoos depending on how his is skin is doing.I use this when he has bumps from his allergies and it helps.
Great dog comb for getting out the undercoat of my Pomeranian. if you don't comb one spot too long the dog wont mind as much. Just remember to make long strokes and move around.
"We have purchased two of these toys, with very mixed experiences. The first one lasted about a week and a half, which for our dog is years for a toy that holds her interest. She much enjoyed the squeakers, and this was a good toy to play fetch with (we live in an apartment building with hardwood floors...) As depicted in the customer images however, we had the exact same problem - she get ahold of the corner and the toy quickly unraveled!The second one that we bought faired rather less well, only lasting about three hours before completely falling apart.I don't know whether this is a quality control issue, or whether simply by design the toy is flawed, but our second experience was enough to put us off this particular toy for life.If you value your money, look elsewhere!"
"I've tried quite a few varieties of cat litter. Clumping, non clumping, clay, corn, wheat, crystal, odor control, you name it. This is the best odor-controlling litter out of all that I've tried, including Tidy Cats Scoop Crystals blend and crystal types of cat litter. Not sure what deodorizers they put in the clay, but they're very potent. If odor control is your #1 priority (as it often is in small apartments, hence the name...) this is your litter.My cats also seem to have no complaints with this litter. The litter itself clumps well, comes in a nicely shaped container for easy pouring, and is not very dusty as the clay grains seem pretty solid. Unfortunately, it does track, and it tracks quite a bit. Get a good, large litter mat and prepare to vaccuum a lot.Ahhhhhh, my apartment smells so fresh right now thanks to this litter!"
Angel Eyes does exactly what I hoped it would do...whiten my dog's face. Within a week or so she looks great again. The eye stains are gone as well as every place she licks. I highly recommend this product if you have a white dog.
"These wipes were ok, but a little expensive for only 25 of them. I found an article from Doberman rescue group that said you can apply Listerine mouthwash to any smelly areas of your dog like stomach and armpits (no private areas of course), when you don't have time or energy to bathe. I tried this and it works very well. Much cheaper."
"I was expecting these to be great toys for my cats that would bounce when you dropped them on the floor. I read a lot of good reviews and was excited because I thought my cats would love them. Unfortunately, the springs do not bounce the way I thought they would. You have to drop them just right to get them to bounce even a little bit, rather than just falling flat. They really are not bouncy at all, and my cats just don't know what to do with them."
"I thought this was a bit gimmicky when I bought it, but I've been using it for a few weeks and it works exactly as described. When you ti it over, all the poop really does end up in the drawer. Quick and easy! Make sure to use clumping litter, though, or it wont work and you will get residue all over the inside of the box.The one thing I will say is that it is heavy. When filled with litter it weighs maybe 20 lbs. I have a back injury so this littler box is the exclusive domain of my boyfriend. Small children and the elderly will have some trouble with this box."
I had to return this product because it did not fit my dog. My dog is a medium sized dog (24 pounds) but he is a little on the tall side. He could not even stand up to go into this crate. This product will only fit a small dog like a Jack Russell. I found a comparable product at an outdoor store that was double the size of this product for a fraction on the price.
"I ordered this product first and then found out that it contains an antibiotic. I spoke to my vet about it and she said that a lot of her clients use it are are very happy with the results and that their pets don't seem to be adversly affected by it. However, she did confirm that it is an antibiotic. I have decided not to give Angel Eyes to my dog for a couple reasons. Most importantly, I'm not comfortable giving my pet an antibiotic regularly for purely cosmetic reasons. Who knows what kind of damage it can be doing to his little body. I can't imagine that regular ingestion of an antibiotic over the life of a dog can be very good for it. Secondly, there's a concern with overuse of antibiotics in our society in general. This antibiotic will be excreted by your pet and will eventually end up in our soil, ground water and oceans. These are things to think about before you purchase this product. Also, NOWHERE on the packaging or on a brochure I picked up at the pet store does it mention that this product contains an antibiotic. The brochure actually touts it as ""natural"" product - I find this extremely deceptive."
"This works great. I have two digs that bark when people come in the house- now i press the button and it shuts them right up. Its to the point after a week i dont even use it anymore, they either don't bark or they stop when they see me go to pick it up. Very glad i bought it"
Seems like an OK product but the pups dont seem to like the Hartz as much as a Nylabone. It's what expected but my dogs just didnt take a liking to it.
"This is a great device to train your dog. The only way it could be better if there was one button for it to beep and give a shock at the same time. As it is, you have to press both buttons at the same time, which is almost impossible with one hand."
"Great product. Has enough straps here and there to keep the hammock in shape. Easily foldable to put the product back in its box and back into the trunk when not in use. Easily adjustable and the 2 pockets are great for holding various dog gear. I only have 2 complaints about this product. 1 - the manufacturers should give the consumer an option (zipper? velcro?) for closing up the holes where the seatbelts can go through. I didn't use it and the dog fur got to my seats through there. 2 - dog fur clings to the material and it took a bit more effort in vacuuming to clean it. Well, I guess it can also be a good thing since wind blowing through open windows while driving would have difficulty picking up the fur from the material and blowing it around your car? (can be a very hazardous situation with dog fur flying everywhere while you're driving). Overall, great buy."
Does a pretty good job. It certainly doesn't catch all the litter. It also gets embedded and its hard to shake it out. I find I have to shake it off daily or it gets tracked around quite a bit.
"I have been a good customer of yours for above subject and now I do not find a thing. Where, how and when can I buy more links?Debbiednorvell@insightbb.com"
"Excellent interactive toy!As a dog trainer, we are constantly seeking interactive toys for obedience work. This toy is excellent for exactly that.The handle is elastic and can easily be chewed off by a dog, however when using this tug for training, it's exceptionally ""user friendly."" The handle is large enough to slide all the way up the arm to the bicep muscle, making a hands free lure... VERY helpful for precision work, even better is the fact that the handle is covered with material that doesn't chafe - meaning that you can loop it around your wrist while working your dog without the risk of rope burn.The tug itself is very durable. No problem with the 90# German Shepherd full grip on this toy. The stitching is very good and the material is excellent.The ""caution"" on the product should be noted before using this product - this is an INTERACTIVE TUG/FETCH toy, NOT a chew toy. It's intended to play WITH your dog NOT for your dog to play with or chew on. If you are looking for a toy for your dog to chew, this is NOT the product!"
"We have been using a soft crate for our large dog for several years, but it was wearing out. When we saw this one used by a friend we decided we had to have one. It seems to be made very well, supported by a collapsable metal frame (for storage)and a strong zipper. The only downside is that with the metal frame it becomes harder to fit into a tight space - so you need to be sure it will fit in your vehicle. And finding it on sale at Amazon made it an even better value. I would recommend this to anyone who travels with a pet."
"My cat adores these. I crumble some over his (Halo salmon) dry food and he is in cat heaven. He loves the salmon version, too. These can also be ""reconstituted"" by adding a little water, as an alternative to wet food. I love that the ingredient list contains a single item"
Our little girl &#34;Zena&#34; (American Pitbull Terrier) loves the flat tabs better than the new fat tabs!Wish that would make a difference?
My dog used to bark when the doorbell rang. I put the collar on my Bichon-Poodle mix and rang the door bell a couple of times. She caught on quickly to what the collar did. Then I took the collar off. I did the same thing the second day. Now I simply grab it and dangle it in the air and she stops the barking. This product was well worth my money!
I use different sizes of blade but I use size 10 to trim the hard to reach area or matted area and always achieve a good result
"I have two small chihuahua mix dogs and they absolutely love this bed warmer. It actually keeps them in bed and calm through the night and during stressful times when I am gone. It is warm to the touch and really heats up the bed when you use it. I would recommend using it with a bed with a liner you can unzip so you can put the warmer inside. This way, the whole bed gets cozy and your dog will stay warm and comfortable.The amazon price is great as my local pet stores are selling these for close to $50."
We have a 6 pound Yorkie and this was way too small for him!!! I had to return it!!I did not re-order I was afraid the next size up would still be too small. Very disappointed
No different than found in a vet's office. A good buy and came in adequate time.
"vivo en el campo y mis perros est&aacute;n en constante exposici&oacute;n a las plagas. Este ha sido el mejor producto que he encontrado para controlar las pulgas y garrapatas, no le produce ning&uacute;n tipo de alergia a los perros."
"This appears to be a high quality treat food that contains only the fruits and nuts indicated, and no extraneous fillers or unnecessary chemicals or dyes. It smells good, which is probably a good indicator in itself.What I do know is that my cockatiel is very particular about his treats, and even though he is 24 years old now, it can be a hit or miss project to figure out what he likes. He likes this. A lot. He actually gets excited when I put it in his dish. His main diet is a formulated pellet mixture, so I'm always looking for supplements with some variety, and this fills the bill.This treat is intended to be only 10% or less of a bird's total diet. It should not be fed as the main source of nutrition, but given sparingly. This product seems to be hard enough to find in a brick-and-mortar store that I have resorted to buying it on the internet. That's how much my bird likes it."
"I was hesitant on this working on my very stubborn terriers. To my shock, it only took wearing the collar for about an hour each and I havent heard a peep from either of them."
"It took less than 1mn for my English Springer Spaniel to rip rubber chunks of rings.Definitely not a chew toy... Returned for credit, don't buy this junk !"
"From the clank this thing makes when it hits a wall, I'm wondering if there's metal in it. Looks and feels like really hard plastic. I was looking for a big ball for my lab/golden to discourage her from playing with our preschooler's big bouncy ball, which makes her crazy. This was the biggest I found. I knew it wouldn't bounce, but I didn't consider from reading the reviews that it'd be so hard I'd bruise my foot kicking it for her. She's not into it unless I get it going, and I have to remember to push it (not kick) with the inside of my foot. She likes it well enough, but I'm wondering what bruises she has under her fur."
"I have used Scatmats in the past for my Rottis and now find them to be just as effective in keeping my furry friends away from areas that they shouldn't be. It only takes a few times of my cats venturing onto the Scatmats to reinforce a change in their behavior. I would also recommend that the ""live"" Scatmat be replaced with the dummy mats when being moved to other areas. Cats are smarter then we give them credit for! And, thank you, Amazon, for another enjoyable shopping experience!"
This is an awesome tool. It works as advertised and if you purchase the earlier model you save at least 50%. It works great on both long and short hair animals and its easier on the skin without the sharp prongs of other brushes. Highly recommended - wish I invented it!
Cosequin was recommended by my veterinarian when my cat kept getting bladder infections. Her bladder was remaining inflamed and this caused her to have accidents. I almost thought I was going to have to confine her to one area or get rid of her.I purchased my first 2 weeks worth of Cosequin from the clinic. I had to open the capsule and sprinkle it on her food. My kitty didn't like the taste so I had to make sure to mix it well in wet food. To purchase a month of Cosequin from the veterinarian would have cost well over $100.I decided to check out Amazon to find a better price. I was very pleased to find a bottle of 80 Cosequin for cats for under $15! They are also tuna and chicken flavored. I open one capsule and sprinkle it on her food once a day. My kitty likes the taste and licks her bowl clean!I am happy to report that the Cosequin healed her irritation and we have not had an accident for 6 months. I continue to give her one each day to keep her bladder healthy. She also has a problem hip joint and the Cosequin helps her hip as well. I am so glad the Cosequin helped and kitty is happy and healthy.
this product does exactly what it claims...removing the underlying coat of hair from my Australian Sheppard's coat. She looks and feels so much better after being brushed. It makes you realize how useless all regular brushes are. good product.
These guards offer various sizes and worked exactly as expected. They were a good buy for the money and arrived on time.
"This is a great product!! It really is nice, with cushioning on the neck and outer ring, which is important if your dog is very active with other dogs. Wears well, very sturdy. Very secure, strong fasteners. Great to guide a blind dog. I have tried several brands, but this one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AND SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHERS--GREAT FEATURES AND PRICE IS QUITE REASONABLE!!!!Kong X-Large E-Collar (16.63'' x .25'' x 30.13'' (X-Large) - Dogs neck sizes"
Good feeder for the money. Does everything I need and more. Don't forget to set how many revolutions it makes when you enter your feed settings or it won't work!
"I liked this product because of the alarm, alarm/spray, or off options. It definitely conserves the spray. Our cat had a problem being on counters and this was recommended by our vet. It totally works. However, you have to keep in mind the personality of your kitty. I thought he would be deterred, but it did terrify him quite a bit. Even with that said, I would recommend it."
"I previously owned one for a year that was starting to have issues, so after pitching it, I purchased a new one from Amazon. I have had the Petmate Fountain for 8 days. A couple of times I noticed a lot of water on the floor and thought it was my cat having fun. I found later that the bowl overflowed onto the floor. When I got home today I immediatly noticed the Petmate not running, my husband took it apart and deemed the motor has burned out. EIGHT DAYS!!!! I will be contacting them for a refund and buy something else."
"ditto to what everyone says, especially how long the coat stays nice and clean and soft. A pleasure to touch."
"I purchased this product hoping that the ""bullet proof like material"" would last longer than the other toys I'd purchased for my 8 month old lab. He's a chewer, and within an hour had the rubber-rope gnawed in two. But someone posted a photo of the modification they made post-rope that saved the day"
"I bought this to walk my 97 lb. Olde English Bulldogge puppy and on the first walk I experienced the same issue that some others have reported - the front clip connection causes the leash to end up under the dogs front legs. So I thought about it for a minute and realized that if I used this harness with a collar and hooked the leash through both it would fix this issue. Guess what? I now have the perfect system for walking a dog. Not exactly rocket science....By connecting the leash to the harness AND the collar it keeps everything at chest level. I used the Rogz Fanbelt collar, which I already had and it works perfectly. No brainer as far as I'm concerned. As far as the other issue that some have reported about irritation under the front legs (armpits) of the dogs, I don't have this issue at all by correctly fitting the harness and using the collar. Overall, this is the best harness for walking a strong dog."
"My two Pembroke Corgis have always loved their hedgehogs and don't like to share them. These are no exception with one observation. These are the first ones that have not been gutted in the dogs' combined 20 years of having different kinds (like Boodas). I can't say that this is a testament to durability (because I know they could destroy them if they wanted to), yet they are certainly enjoyed on a daily basis, being grunted on, carried around proudly and tossed about. The initial purchasing experience was slightly disappointing because the picture showed two toys, yet only one was included. The price is much better than what you would find at pet store / in a pet aisle. At this time, this toy is available as a Prime Add-On Item that ships free (see details), making it an even better deal."
"our dog responds to this more than any dog treat.We have tried many different treats, but this seems to be the one that is most preferred.This brand was recommended by our dog trainer."
I have a pure bred German Sheppard that is 7 months old and this thing is bigger than her head. She loves it and I will be buying her another one after she destroys this one.
"After reading many reviews - positive and negative at Amazon, I took the plunge and purchased this. The negative reviews were right, and the positive reviews were just some folks that got lucky. To be fair, this is an excellent design; however, the Chinese manufacturing is severely lacking in quality. I had two MAJOR problems that would have stopped most people--especially those without a closet full of tools:1. They FORGOT to drill all of the holes in one panel--how do you forget that? I fixed it by using my nail gun and glue, but if you are not handy, that is a deal stopper right there. It would have been too difficult to drill the missing holes without a drill press, special jig, and special bit.2. The person assembling the door was either lazy or poorly trained. There is a different top and bottom hinge for this item; however, at the factory, they bolted the top hinge on the top and the bottom! So, I managed to get past the first problem, and then I had to remove the hinges and replace them with something else from the hardware store (the provided hinges are custom, so you can't just run out to get the right part).On the positive side, the directions are better than any made-in-China item I have ever seen, and the parts are labeled very clearly. If this company can just get employees that do their job properly, they will have a good product.Oh, and because I had to use a nail gun, that dedicated me to putting putty in the holes and repainting the whole unit, which needed it anyway because the top shelf arrived with a scratch.I am happy with the result, but if you are not a home handyman, don't bother to purchase this product--you will be very frustrated."
Kitty couldn't get it off and it didn't seem to bother her as she only wears it at the vet.
Why is this item taking so long to ship out? Most items I have ordered in the past are shipped out the next day or two. I am on the verge of cancelling this item and going to my local store to make this purchase.
"I have a 67 lb. German Pincher and a 78 lb. lab and Shepard mix. Ya it lasted 2 weeks, stick with Kong extreme the black ones and Nylobone."
"These pee pads do the job very well for my 10lb Chihuahua. I haven't found any brand that works better, and Amazon has the best price I've found."
"This is exactly what my puppy needed. We tried to confine him in a specific area with cardboard...that didn't work. We tried the bathroom, that didn't work. With this play pen he can see all around him and he never yelps. He sees us, we see him and he's happy! His wood dog crate fits in there too, which makes a perfect confined area while we are at work. He has room to play, sleep, and do his bussiness. (He's still a puppy in training!) It folds up easy for travel too! I highly reccommend this play pen!"
"I recently purchased the collar in hopes that it would help stop my dog's constant pulling during walks. After receiving the collar and watching the included DVD we took our dog for a walk. WOW! What a change! My dog is very energetic, constantly sniffing and pulling. We've tried several types of collars and tactics to stop or at least contain the behavior. Nothing seemed to work and walks were more work than pleasure. After fitting this collar we went for a short walk to try it out. Within literally 100 feet he was no longer pulling. By the end of the walk he was staying right beside me. You can use one or two fingers on the leash and the dog will respond.All I can say is, just buy it."
My Dog really loves these bagels. She has one every night after dinner for a treat. She's been eatting them for 5 years. Other brans of bagels get weavels.
"I have 2 10 lb Shih Tzus and they can't get enough of these. I've never had one wear out either. I think they like the feel of the little nubs. I have a 25 lb. Schnauzer who likes to chew them too. He has strong jaws and chews very aggressively, but again, they never wear out. Just the perfect size for my dogs to actually hold them between their feet and chew for hours on end."
"Purchased one from a large box discount retail store for our new little 4 and 7 month old rescues we adopted, to keep them contained in the house while we are too busy to watch them. PERFECT! They love being in there. Have used it 3 months and what a wonderful product! Very lightweight and not cumbersome like other pens. This easily (and happily) contains our now 10 month old 9 lb. Morkie and 8 month old 12 lb. Shichon. They walk in on their own like they do their crates. We purchased the 2 panel extension at the same time, thinking it was too small, but found the 2 panels were not needed. We use those across the basement stairway to keep the puppies from going down. PERFECT for a gate when you have a dog that respects barriers. We purchased another 4 sided pen for even less money than the discount retailer, here on Amazon, and had it shipped to our home on the Gulf. Super easy and quick to assemble the door. Lightweight enough to carry the collapsed pen with one hand (13 lb. I believe?). And it looks nice. One of my very favorite small dog products. We just arrived at the beach and I am going to purchase the 2-panel in addition, to use to block off access on our balcony to the stairs."
"I've got a little 5.5 pound yorkie that loves to pee everywhere, and it has seemed impossible to get this dog potty trained- until that is, we bought this pen. He stays in there while we're not playing with him, or when we're at work, and when we come home we bring him immediately outside where he does his business.Before the pen we used a crate, which was effective for when we were away for short periods of time, but horrible when we were gone any longer or for when we just didn't want him to run around freely.The pen has enabled us to do what we need to with out the guilt of having our dog all crated up and without room to play. And magically, it's been a great transition from the cramped crate to the pen, as it's not too big and not too small- really just the right size for him to feel cozy and protected but with just enough room to move around. He even holds his potty, most of the time, while in there as he would the crate.As for the construction and quality, over the utility, it's pretty well put together and easy to assemble. I'm able to pop out the pins that hold it together and move it through out the house as needed, even don't mind lugging it up the stairs if I want.It could be just a couple inches taller though. I've got a small dog and he's just about able to climb out, I mean one day he will, but not as of yet. I'm sure others may have this difficulty with the pen if they haven't got puppies or a small dog like mine.Yet, if you can get past that part or have a really small dog, this pen is really great and a huge bargain for the use you get out of it."
My main problem with this is the size of the urine clumps/cling-ons. They are so large that they don't fit on their way out with the rest of the disposable litter in the cartridge. How do you manage to sqeeze them through to dump the litter? I end up removing the top and scooping it out with a conventional scoop.
Great for dogs with any skin allergy plus they love them. Wellness makes great products to keep dogs healthy and fit. Our boys love their products!
"Our little Yorkie loves it! I agree with some of the reviewers that they are little too soft for a powerful chewer. We tried all kinds of toys and not too many survived her chewing for more than a day, some had to be thrown away after 15-20 minutes of work. These key, however, last for a while. We do supervise and check frequently on the condition of the toy when she seem to be addicted to chewing. Fortunately, she spits out the pieces without swallowing, but when the end looks too chewed up, it's easy to cut it off with the sharp scissors. Eventually they become too small and then we buy a new set. I probably won't recommend it for a big dog but for a little one it's a pretty good toy."
We purchased this crate for our small yorkie. It's been perfect. Well built and pretty easily collapsible. The price is probably the best we saw anywhere. Highly recommend to anyone!
"This is a fantastic item when taking your dog for a walk. No need to worry about finding your dog something to drink out of. Just pack a bottle of water/ whip out your bowl, unfold it and pour in the water. You can stop anywhere/anytime. There have been many hot days that my dog has been happy to take his ""water break"". This bowl is well constructed, folds and snaps shut. Don't leave home without one!"
"My pugs do not like lumpy,bumpy, thick bedding so this works great! It is soft, but not sure how it will wash (haven't washed it yet). My little boy pug immediately slept on it and just knew it was for him! ( :"
We love nylabones around our home. Our two goldens must have the durable nylabone as they quickly destroy a flexible one. I thought that this Dinosaur Nylabone was the bigger size since it said Wolf but it was pretty small at 4 inches. I had to give it to my friend's cocker spaniel. It was just too small for a golden retriever.
"Cat didn't care for it. Never used it as a scratcher. Broke within a month, and is now adding to a landfill's contents. Terrible purchase; I would not recommend it."
"This item was shipped really quickly which was great because my dog had chewed up her other collar that is similar to the gentle leader. I have used this collar before and it worked wonders for the dogs that pull because it turns their head to the side so that they are unable to pull you. However, I now have a 2 1/2 year old border collie mix and it is not working as well as it has in the past with my other dogs. I think that i just need to keep working on the training with this pup as she is a little to smart. Normally, I would highly recommend this collar and it will prevent the dog from having enough power to pull you really hard but I have learned that it is not as effective with all dogs."
"We have a 4.5 old puppy, that LOVES this toy. We put treats at the bottom and stuff all the squirrels and a few other toys in there and let him go at it. He loves the challenge. Durable so far, and doesn't leave a mess of treats everywhere. This is a defnite hit with our puppy and family. Great product, great concept."
It's a great help in training. The dogs can smell it and will do what you want when this treat is the reward.
"Like many people, I have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on. Despite talking to the neighbor politely and such, they still have no concern for the noise pollution. I was losing sleep, and the barking was getting so bad that I even considered moving!In desperation, we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. We came across Viatek's Super Bark Stop and decided to risk the money.WOW, talk about being worth the money! My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood, and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. It's unsightly, yes, but we're the only ones to really see it. More importantly, it's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT. The first time he tested it, he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! We laughed gleefully. Could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...?It's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY. The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. If it starts to yelp a little, it stops almost immediately. It's as if it's afraid to bark. YAY!You can select the volume, tone, and number of barks to help eliminate false activation (say, from talking or loud bird squawking). Audible and inaudible both work fine, but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting.The device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 D batteries (not included) to operate it.I am SO thankful we found Super Bark Stop! My nerves were really getting jangled and I was dreading early mornings, when they put the mutt outside. It's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are; just because you may want a dog doesn't mean I want saddled with its noise while you neglect it!P.S. After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks (yes, it did work!), we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (Not as bad as before, though.) We had it on silent, and realized that it had stopped working. Apparently, it's not 100% waterproof, despite the claims of the manufacturer. The person I bought it from said that ""once it's opened, we find that it's not 100% waterproof"". Well guess what? You gotta open it to put the batteries in it! Either buy a faux bird house to protect Bark Stop or house it where it won't get wet. Otherwise, you may find yourself in the same position we were in. We got a refund, and fortunately for us, our neighbors got rid of their dog...so we didn't bother getting a new one."
"This is possibly the worst product ever fashioned by human hands. When it does work, which is rarer than the appearance of most astronomical phenomenon, all the tines of the rake serve to do is spear chunks of cat feces and carry them back to the return position, leaving nothing in the waste receptacle. Spending just five minutes scraping it off is enough to make me want to stab myself with one of said tines, that I might become infected with a deadly strain of ecoli, and be permanently freed from this abortion of a product. Please, spend your money elsewhere, and if you already own one, do humanity a favor and destroy it, preferably by incineration."
"I use this for my indoor cats by putting it on their paws, and for my outdoor ferals in their wet and dry food. They all eat it easily and it has helped them all with the sneezing and weepy eyes. You cannot beat the price, hopefully it will continue to be affordable. I definitely plan to reorder."
"Attractive, easy to assemble. My mini-dachshunds really enjoy sitting and watching their world. They fall asleep on it so, I imagine it's quite comfortable for them."
"Several years ago, I purchased the Andis ProPet clipper to clip my cockapoo. The large universal comb, paired with a standard 1/8"" stainless Andis clipper blade, provides a smooth, even cut every time. The clipper comb is a nice alternative to purchasing a much more expensive single blade, and for approximately $30 less than a similar blade, it's well worth the money.Pro's:--Extremely inexpensive--Metal hinge adjusts to fit clipper head--Comb adjusts to a snug, secure fit on the clipper--Provides an even, smooth cut every timeCon's:--The comb has wide teeth, but it is plastic. If you have a curly-haired dog, you'll need to comb out any snarls before grooming."
I love everything about the appearance of my little BRIGHT GREEN carry-on suit case purchased at Amazon.com. I choose the color because it would be easy to identify. On my first trip I was able to store it in the overhead bins on the plane. One leg of the flight it was taken and stored in the hold of the plane due to over crowding. After being stored in the hold one of the rear wheels became a problem. It turned sideways and it dragged instead of rolling. This wheel works properly on and off. I realize the rough handling luggage receives in transit. But It should have been built to with stand the treatment.
"This thing is AMAZING. Seriously life changing. We have a 90 lb Lab who had major joint surgery and was put on severely limited activity for many months. Consequently, when we got the vet's okay to start leash walks, our dog was so excited and enthusiastic that he was a nightmare to walk. He completely pulled me off my feet more times than I'd care to admit, and if we came across another dog or person - forget about it. He'd pull so hard he'd choke himself and he would lunge at people and scare them (not being agressive, just wanted to meet them - but it'd still scare them to have a huge dog running towards them with me barely hanging on), and I was seriously starting to worry about dislocating a shoulder or elbow because he would pull so hard. Walks were completely miserable. In desperation I tried the Gentle Leader....and omg. The very first time we tried it I saw a 100 percent improvement. I thought for sure it was just a fluke, but low and behold we've been using it twice a day for a month now and the difference is AMAZING. Walks are actually pleasant now (for both of us). I can literally hold on to the leash with two fingers for our enitre walk. He doesn't lunge anymore and the pulling is nonexistant. Keeping him from ""meeting"" other people and dogs is a cinch. If he starts to pull I just give the leash a quick little tug and he stops. I could kiss the feet of the person who invented this. If you're going to buy this product, make sure you watch the DVD that comes with it - it's very helpful for learning how to fit the collar and how to use it.I did remove one star because after a month of twice-daily use the fur on the top of his nose is starting to rub off a little bit. But it's not bad and doesn't seem to bother him. I've been recommending this to everyone who stands still long enough to listen and would buy it again in a heartbeat."
"I recently purchased this from my local Petco. We had been given the mini version (I think from the same brand) when my French Bulldog now 7 months old was 2 months old. That one held up fine until more recently when it started showing more and more bite marks when as she lost her baby and grew her adult teeth. So I tossed it and brought home the next larger size since she's bigger. We had the larger size not a couple hours before she was literally removing whole chunks from the sides of the tire-the section near the writing and the hole in the middle. I don't know if the manufacturing process changed, the pieces weren't fully melted together, or if the items just got cheaper, but this was her favorite toy and now I am worried about replacing it with yet another one that cost over $10 and lasted hours. She had pieces of it everywhere. I wrote down the website and contact info but never got around to contacting them for the issue. My husband threw it away the other day when the dog had snatched it from the hiding spot and he found her chewing on pieces again and then later throwing up. We should have just thrown it away the first day, but I thought they might want it back to see it or test it or something. I may try another brand, but this one is no longer good for us. Too dangerous and costly."
"I finally got the product but unfortunately my 1 year old maltese refuses to eat her food. The powder is extremely bitter and it doesn't have the best smell, so I guess it repels her. Unfortunately I wasn't able to see the results, I wish the makers of the product would have added some kind of flavor so the fussy little dogs would be able to eat it too."
"January 21, 2008Dear Littermaid...I purchased the Littermaid and several accessories for a total of over $145 the first week of December. I had heard so many good things and wanted it to work properly so I even purchased the overpriced Littermaid brand kitty litter . I have two small cats who eat IAMS (not cement blocks). I have had nothing but problems with this product. I am so disappointed. Either my cats relieve themselves at an exorbitant rate or I will have to sell my firstborn to pay for the replacement trays. The rake gets stuck. I have to clean/scrape the box 2X per day. I have tried switching to Fresh Step Clumping and Scoop Away with the same results. I have raised the litter levels, I have lowered the litter levels. I have pushed the litter to the back. I have pushed the litter to the front. I bought the special stuff so the litter does not stick to the bottom of the box. I have stood on my head did a little dance. If I was a four year old boy I may have enjoyed how much I have played in the ""sand box"" the six weeks. I have asked the Litter Box God to please tell me the ""Littermaid secret"". I give up. The secret is apparently I AM THE LITTERMAID! A simple litter box was so much easier. I only had to clean that 1x per day and did not have to woken up the the painful scraping of a rake that cannot quite make it through a 1/2 inch of with litter a dime size clump of pee. God forbid they actually poop in there. I had asked for the Littermaid for Christmas (as sad as that is) and at this point I really want Santa to take it back. Give me my shovel and a plastic shopping bag. I suurender. I really regret not asking for a new poop shovel and taken the $100 and my cats could be pooping in gold dust. Wow. I did not know I was that mad. Sorry."
"I got this shampoo for my Bernese Mountain Dog and have been very impressed overall. I am usually quite critical of shampoos that clean both hair and body but this one seems to live up to its claims. My dog's coat is softer and healthier and she seems to be itching less. Her coat is definitely more manageable and it smells great.I was so impressed with this product that I decided to try it myself. My coat looks and feels great - I now use it everyday! It does not work as good as Dove as a body wash, but as a shampoo it beats most human shampoos. I should note that it feels a little different than human shampoos; I would recommend it for shorter, dry-ish hair. My wife still prefers her Brilliant Brunette shampoo despite my recommendations to her that this shampoo would be much more economical. She claims her long coat feels a little oily even though it looks and shines great.I have recommended this product to friends but none of them have tried it yet."
"My rather obnoxious and could at times be destructive Rottweiler/Shar Pei 61lb muttpuppy loves this toy. It is seemingly indestructible. Busy Buddyy products, in general, tend to be the best I've found outside the Kong products. I bought one of these about 4 years ago and the only thing wrong with it, after years of abuse, is the rope is gone and it won't unscrew. We still fill it with puppy-size dog treats and our dog still plays with it. She picks up the &#34;ball&#34; of it and carries it around the house, gently placing it at our feet when she's ready to play with it (as in &#34;get me some treats now, I'm bored&#34;).I bought a new one pretty much because of the rope and the ball getting rather nasty with dog spit after four years of her carrying it around the house. It's still a fairly intact toy after all this time.Without the rope, you can fill it (only 1/2 way) with puppy-size treats like Milkbones, but with a new one, fill with something smaller. We use cat food or cut up/break up, jerky-type treats into smaller sizes.If you have a bored dog, using one of these toys is a life-saver for your house. I admit -- watching her flip it and manipulate it to get the treats to fall out is really amusing... better than TV. This toy comes in a smaller size but our Jack Russell isn't interested in it -- we suspect because he's not interested in playing without us participating along with him.Worth the money.Lasts a long time, almost indestructible.Entertains a dog for a fairly long time and it's safe for the dog to have when you are not in the room (in my opinion)"
"My cat is diabetic and can only have 3/4 of a can of food per feed. She was driving me crazy starting at 4:00 am when she wanted to be fed and later at night the same. Now, she does not cry anymore just sits by the feeder until it's time to eat.It's also better that she gets her food at the same time. And now we don't need a sitter for every time we are out of the house for more than 1/2 day. I placed 4 feedings (2 days worth) and the food did not spoied"
"Brushing my dog was always a chore because she hated it and none of the brushes really got any undercoat out - but this tool is amazing. In one 10-minute session (without her running away - she even was lying on her back for a belly rub!) I pulled out as much fur as I sweep up in a week. The hardwood floors will look better longer, her coat is shinier, and she loves it so it is like a personal rub down for her! I would recommend it to anyone who has a big shedder in the house."
Began tripping my GFI within 1 week of use. Do not buy. Unfortunately I got what I paid for and it was a waste of money
"My vet charges a fortune for this wormer, but it the only wormer that she uses so I know that it must be very effective and it is. It hits several types of parasites and works GREAT! My dog laps up the powder in food, so no bad taste I guess."
"I have two small dogs - a Pekapoo and a Cairn terrier. One is three and the other about a year old. They both love this dog food. They pieces are small and the food stays fresh, although they could improve the bag design in this regard. The only downside is that other critters will love the food also, so if you leave the food bowl outside you may get some neighborhood visitors very early in the morning :)"
"My cats don't really understand the point of this toy. When I push it around for them, they eat the food that falls out, but won't push it themselves unless they're starving. They've had it about a week, and it's really their only source of dry food. It's also SUPER messy...I am constantly stepping on bits of cat food. Not sure how I feel about this toy, but I'm willing to give it more time."
"My cats love this toy and it's so effortless. I just sit on the couch and hold it in my hand and it bounces between my two cats forever. They can't get enough of it. The reason it got 4 stars and not 5 is for two reasons. #1, it comes in a small package wrapped up in a circle, so the wire is permanently shaped that way. This wouldn't be a problem except when my cats pull down on the end, it bends even more so after a few weeks of play it's bent in a weird shape. I tried bending it to straighten it out and it didn't work too well. My other complaint is the end that you hold has a little cardboard piece on it and after about a week of play it came off, so it's a little difficult to keep in my hand with my cats yanking on the other end. If I had paid more for this toy I would be disappointed but since it's so cheap I guess I should've expected it. Despite these problems I would recommend the toy because my cats go crazy for it."
"I agree with a former poster. I bought this to keep my 2 dogs out of the litter box. Unfortunately, my 30 some pound terrier fits through the pet door without hardly trying. I still use it, but keep the pet door partially closed. It helps some, but not as much as I would like. The pet door is seriously too big."
Item to small for 10 pound dog. Not sturdy would never drive withour feeling my pet was safe. end end
"This heater was absolutely perfect! Its easy to use and as long as used properly in a 2-5 gallon tank works perfectly! It brought my 2.5-3 gallon tank from 71 degree F to a comfortable 76-77 degrees which is great for my little betta Herbert =] Its great for dorm room (which I currently live in) because its simple and non obtrusive. if you have a small tank and just need to bring it a few degrees this is what you need, just be sure to monitor room temp. because it will keep the tank temp. a few degrees above that and since we keep the room a about 72-73 degrees usually it keeps his tank at a toasty 76-77. Again this really was a perfect solution for my tank and gently brought the temperature up from 71 degrees, this was great because it didn't require me removing herbert as he adjusted naturally over about 24 hours. I use the coralife digital thermometer with the heater and it has worked great as well! ESU Coralife Digital Thermometer item #232"
"This is just an ""antena"" with some cardboard on it, nothing much in this toy, but when you set it somewhere and it bounces around my cat loves it. I don't need to be with him to play, he just plays with the toy for hours at a time.The only thing is, it's so simple you can buy some wire an Home Depot and make it yourself for much less...."
"The Furminator makes our chocolate Lab look wonderful during his undercoat shedding season. It fits our hands, either my extra large ones or Alisons small - medium hands. The Furminator works like a small rake in your hand and easily removes only Ruger's lighter colored undercoat. It leaves his deep chocolate coat shiney and bright. Ruger looks like a professional just finished grooming him for a dog show! We highly recommend the Furminator.Ted, Alison & 'Ruger'"
UPDATE AFTER TEN DAYS OF USE
"I have read so many reviews with people complaining about the smell... Seriously people!! If you put your face all over it then of course it smells! But I could not smell anything other than dog food, besides my 100 lb American bulldog eats in 3 seconds so no odor lol ..."
"This product is the best bar-none. It traps cat litter, cats don't mind walking on it since it has a smooth surface, and best of all is easy to clean and even contains liquid. Other mats with ""astro turf"" or with raised rubber nubs are a mess to clean. ""PetSmart"" and ""Doctors Foster and Smith"" carried this product in the past. Whoever sells cat products should stock this item."
"It leaks, it will not automatically dispense water reliably, causing the pump to draw air, and it's a pain to clean. Get a bowl, you'll be much happier..."
"I don't know exactly how these machines get such a glowing review from some people.I've bought 3 - three - of them. Each one of them ""bigger-and-better"" than the previous one and none of them - absolutely NONE of them - could make the slightest difference in the stupid barking pattern.The dogs still bark their lungs off at will.The first 5 minutes can be intriguing for the dogs. I mean, the noise is a curious novelty.But after that, these deterrents can beep to (battery) death and these dogs won't even blink at the noise.Not even blink.Maybe a wall of these could make a difference. Somehow. But I'm not willing to spend that amount of money to find out.Definitely not recommended.Can Viatek hire ""good review for cash"" services? Would that be ethical?"
I purchase these blades to have as an extra set while my blades were being sharpened. The price was very good!
"I have a small dog, 15 lbs and this is safe and easy to use."
We have a Philippine Zoysia lawn and this wire rake scooper is far and away the best we've ever used!
"product arrived much faster than expected, and it is exactly the same as the one my vet sells or what you will find at pet stores only CHEAPER. why pay more? I lucked out with free shipping, and I could not be more pleased"
"I finally found a heater that can actually heat my 120 gallon reef tank. It has a sleek design and I love the fact that you can adjust the temperature from the AC Box instead of being on the actual heater. There is a temp dial on the AC Box. The only negative is the heater turns off befroe it reaches the desired temp, so I set the heater higher than I actually want the water temperature. It falls 3 degrees below the desired temp. I just set the temp on the dial 3 degrees higher than I want and it works perfectly. It is small and does an awesome job of heating the water. This is the best heater I have ever owned.!!"
"These are one of the few treats to which both of our greyhounds aren't allergic. They really enjoy them, and they're hard to find at regular pet supply stores."
"I purchased this for my 2 bunnies but both of them had no interest in it, they walked around it once and never came close to it again. The material is less than what I expected, its too scratchy for rabbit's delicate skin, I also think the coloring of the product is unnecessary, it would have been a more natural & safe product for animals to chew on."
"My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good. They have three calories per treat. About pea-sized.I used them for training and when they go to their areas when I head out to work in the morning.There's really not much more to be said. I did set up the amazon subscription on a two-month basis and may bump that up to monthly eventually. I will see.I can only recommend these because the price and value are excellent and they are great if you have does. Light, small, portable."
They last forever. Mine's been in continual use for probably close to 20 years now.
The dog loved this thing. He tried so hard to get the peanut butter from the inside that his nose was bleeding from rubbing on the bone part. I helped to microwave it for a few seconds to refresh the smell/taste after it had sit for a few days.
"Bella is our 12 year old 26 pound terrier mix. We keep a small blanket on the sofa that she is allowed on...but as she has gotten older we noticed it was getting more and more difficult for her to jump up. The description of these steps seemed right...but I was skeptical of the materials and ""no tools needed"" construction. I'm happy to say the steps snapped together fine and are surprisingly sturdy for our needs. Step two...getting Bella to use them. She comes up the outdoor deck stairs ok so I figured she would be find with these. But after years of jumping up and down, change was not going to come easy. Bella loves her treats and we had to use them for three days...first to get her to put her paws up on the first step and then to lead her up both steps. She still jumps if she gets excited but more and more she uses the steps. We hope that means more Terrier time with good joints for us to enjoy."
"When I considered this product I must admit I had high hopes judging by the reiews I read..I wouldnt have given it any stars at all But it works on 3 of our animals..It does shut one of our many Chihuahuas mouths up, & 2 cats it keeps them from scratching our couch! thats when we see them & can push the button...If your buying this product in high hopes of training your dog to not bark...its a hit & miss..1 dog out of every 10 is sad odds to say the least...we are very bummed this product didnt work for us.."
Order came quickly. Received e-mails to update me on order status. Great product.Works as described. Would purchase again.
"I've only had this product for a month, but so far, I like it. My cats were very bad about drinking from the toilet and faucets instead of out of a bowl of water set out for them, and this was a great solution. They both drink from this.The only complaint I have is how noisy it gets- on the plus side, it lets me know when the water is getting low, but if it runs low in the middle of the night, it's loud enough to wake me."
"My Dog was covered with some type of sores all over his body and nothing helped, doc tried every drug and test available to the tune of $3,00.00 and finally suggested shampooing him with this product and lo and behold his skin problem cleared up. He had been on a diet food for ever and nothing helped until the shampoo and it has been six months since he has been free of sores. I love this product."
"Am a certified vet technician; we buy these for our elderly dogs; find them much better (more absorbent, less tendency for runoff, etc.) than Blue Ribbon.I also recommend them for pet-sitting clients with elderly cats- placed outside/around the litter box to ensure a cleaner environment for hit-or-miss behaviors that can come with elderly cats.HOWEVER, it is a royal pain that they changed the color of the backing plastic to the color of URINE (from the original blue).WHAT were they thinking??!?What's really hilarious- on one of the packages, they justified the color change by saying that it was better for 'DECOR'.NEWS FLASH"
When they work... it's an awesome pet carrier! I have several and liked them so much that I wanted to get more. All it would take for this company to go from making a terrible product to a GREATone would be for someone to check that they function before shipping them out. I ordered two and could not operate the latches on BOTH of them. Amazon was great and sending them back for replacements was easy. Same problem with the replacements. This time I kept them hoping that the latching system would &#34;break in&#34; over time. Chances are equally good that they will just &#34;break&#34;. I'm very disappointed. My old ones are great!
"We've currently been using a Petmate Freshflow. Based on reviews, we decided to replace it with a new Drinkwell.The fountain immediately began vibrating and had a VERY LOUD humming noise. We waited for about five minutes because a new motor needs time to adjust. However, it did not stop. We pulled the plug and plugged it in again. Same thing. Our cats won't go near loud noises, but more importantly, the motor could burn out and cause an electrical short. This scares us.We're returning the fountain for a refund. We can't believe all the reviewers who are happy with this. We may have received a defective unit, but are not willing to try a replacement."
well made dog toy which is really cute. I bought it for a friends Dog and it likes to take the squirrels out of the log but you have to hide a treat in with the squirrels too. I think my own terriers would love to wrestle them out of their though.
"It was great bottle for about a month, but then the seal broke and the bottle started to leak. I like glass bottles because they feel more sanitary and less likely to grow bacteria, but the screw-cap on this bottle just lost it's ability to seal properly."
"Well, I'll join the ranks of happy dog campers here and say you and your dogs will surely love these treats.I will pay whatever it takes to make sure the treats I buy are:1. As NATURAL as possible. That means NO dyes (especially that ridiculous neon red color in most dog treats) no artificial flavors (like the sickening ""smoke"" flavor also used on most of the treats) no nitrates or all the other chemicals.2. Made in the U.S.A.I have checked out all the natural liver treat products from the big pet supermarkets to more than a dozen online pet suppliers. Sadly, with all the pet deaths these past few years from contaminated Chinese ingredients, we all know the reasons why you need to watch out and make certain that you buy a pet treat product made ONLY in America.This is NOT the cheap crap made in China that you see in Walmart, so YES it will cost more, but of course, your pet's health and your peace of mind is worth it.If you want to save a ton of money, it's also almost effortless to make a big batch of your own beef liver treats at home and your dogs will worship you if you do!I have been buying this brand for years and my dog love it. This container lasts a long time and will have your dog thinking you really complete him!Highly recommend this treat."
the product was just as it was explained and has worked well so far. Just remember to keep the citronella filled in the collar:)
"This is a good product. Nothing fancy, but it get's the job done. Hides unsightly soiled liter scoop and provides a place to put it in the first place. I have one next to each of the litter boxes in the house."
"I have two dogs that love to destroy toys. When one was a puppy he ate up all the wooden legs to our tables and chairs. The other destroys almost any toy we get her within hours. We generally only get them super durable ""Kong"" toys, but even those get destroyed if we let the dogs have them other than when we play with them. I was skeptical about this lasting months for dogs that love to chew because no toy lasts an hour if either of my dogs has them without human interaction.This toy is impressive. For one, my dogs love it. Nonetheless, the toy is ultimately destructible. I left my lab with the toy for less than 30 minutes. Already, an inch or more has been pulled out of the edge of the toy. The toy is definitely great if you plan to play ""fetch"" or some similar game with your dogs. It is perfectly sized for a medium to large sized dog and will likely give months of fun. Do not, however, leave it alone with your dog if your dogs are like mine and love to chew.The toy gets a review of three because my dogs love it. Nonetheless, any future purchases will be used exclusively for ""fetch"" type games. On a related note, the ""Planet Dog Orbree-Tuff Glowball"" seems much more durable. Its much smaller (like a tennis ball) and has lasted over an hour without any visible damage. Granted, the glowball, like a tennis ball, should not be given to the dog without direct supervision."
I have six guinea pigs and they go through a lot of timothy hay! Oxbow makes and sells high quality products and come highly recommended by our vet. The value for the price can't be beat. I have paid more than double this price buying similar products at local pet stores.
"Great price and works great. This is a two piece glass canopy for my Aqueon 55 gal 48"" X 13"" tank.Each piece has 2 glass parts with a rubber flange in the back for cords. My 48"" long tank has a center piece so each of these fits 24"" X 13"" side by side.I got them in record time and they fit perfectly. Most glass canopies cost more, this is just a great product at a great price."
"Being that I have an Airedale Terrier (over 70 lbs) I have to be very picky and harsh on products. Treats don't need to just say ""long lasting"", ""tough"", ""durable"" or ""everlasting"", they need to prove it. This flavor and product last way longer than I expected. It pops out of theStarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Largea little sooner than I would like, but, considering I did have a hard time putting two treats in there I would have to say if they made it harder to come out I may not be able to put it in.The very first time one treat lasted a good five minutes, on the second attempt maybe more like four minutes and that is just because he knows how hard to bite down now. Either way with the whole package I would say it is a good investment as a once in a while kind of treat for when he does something special or we just need silence to watch a show (30 minutes to 1 hour, not a 2-hour series premier).My dog is pretty mellow when he has his exercise, but, when it is missed this can help to get some quiet. Though every dog, no matter the breed needs to be exercised."
"its a real bummer to order something off of amazon based on a description that has no basis in the reality of the product you receive. I mean, yeah, this product works well enough in disciplining our cats, so we'll keep it... but its so far removed from the description/functionality/features that were described that I almost feel ripped off. Plus, the manual that came with the item doesnt even remotely cover the item I received.Consider this a simultaneous ""WTF? Well, it kinda works, so I guess we'll keep it"" moment.Get your act together, ""PetSafe/ScatMat/Amazon"". This product is TOO EXPENSIVE for what I received, and thats NOT COOL."
"I would have to agree with the other reviews on this, the pump can definitely work in larger tanks just fine. I have it in my 40 gallon tank and it works perfect. It can be noisy if its not sitting properly, had it happen a few times. I'm not sure how many bubblers this could power, but I know it can power a 10"" stone just fine. Might consider getting a check valve just in case it loses power.Conclusion"
"If you own a dog that you would rather not have to carry around when the snow hits - this product is for you!As the owner of a 60+ pound Catahoula who demands daily exercise the fact it's snowing or people who put rock salt down cannot deter me or him from our daily hour long walks. So, upon the first snowfall and application of rock salt I saw immediately we had a problem - my boy would three paw and then two-paw trying to keep going as the salt irritated his feet! Well, let's just say carrying him the six blocks home was not the answer!We tried boots, and if your dog is like my dog you'd think you just coated his feet in glue. So, the next best solution was that Musher's Wax. It's perfect. Lasts for about two weeks of walks and is easy to apply. You can either put it on with your fingers or simply swipe your dog's paw. It also dries pretty quickly and has not left a mess on my carpet as far as I can tell. Really, I cannot rate this product highly enough. I would advise that if you have a larger dog to perhaps buy a larger container - the smaller one was just big enough to swipe my dog's paw."
"This bone is the tops and best of all not expensive. I have bought many different toys for my dog and he destroys them all within a few days. This bone is great because it has actually lasted over two weeks and is still going strong. The ends are getting chewed up but at a very slow pace. My guess is this will easily last a month or two, if not longer. My dog also absolutely loves chewing on this. If he is inside sitting around this bone is in his mouth being chewed. That is why I am so surprised it has lasted this long. Usually if my dog chews something for a whole day it would be in a million pieces. The only other toy that has been able to last this long is a king size kong, but my dog won't even look at it twice unless it is packed with treats."
"I've had Drinkwell fountains for years and loved them, as did our cats. Time for another one, and upgraded to the Platinum model. It is bigger, with a better design in putting it back together after cleaning; however, it is really big. You have to have a very large sink, or clean it in the bathtub. It is very difficult to hold in one hand while wiping all the crevices with the other hand. Putting a filled reservoir back on the fountain requires more graceful moves than I have, so water goes everywhere. I liked the older model much better."
My dog obviously loved her new bone but it lasted less than 5 min. I give her a bone when I leave to keep her occupied since she has separation anxiety. She finished this bone before I had a chance to get out the door. In my opinion this bone costs too much to last such a little amount of time
"There isn't much to this product as it is a cat feeder after all, but it's a solid cat feeder. Prior to purchasing this item, my cat's ""feeding station"" consisted of a place mat on the kitchen floor with his water bowl and food bowl on top of the place mat. But he would do this odd thing of wiping his paws on the place mat, which would result in little pieces of cat litter everywhere and his food scraps on my kitchen floor. This feeder got rid of that problem as he really can't wipe his paws on it. As for keeping food off the floor, it does a pretty good job. The only way food still gets on the floor is by him chewing away from the bowls once in awhile, which results in food falling from his mouth. Though not visually stunning, it is visually appealing and would fit well with any decor."
"I've used Advantage for years and it has always done exactly what it was supposed to do. I tried Biospot because it was cheaper, but I went back to Advantage. Biospot was too messy and didn't hold up as well. Advantage is worth the few dollars more."
"I love my dog, and was concerned about her safety while riding in the car.This product did exactly what I expected it to do. It was worth the purchase price."
"I have a mixed breed dog that I got from a rescue. They say he may be a mix of a portuguese sheep dog and a schnauzer. He has an undercoat and his fur tends to be about 2-3 inches long, a little more shiny towards his neck more of a matte thick texture towards his back. Its a little wavy and it tends to get matted QUICK. I left him with a friend and his other dogs while I went on vacation and when I got back, his fur was sooo matted.I bought this brush along with this oneMiracle Coat Slicker Dog Brush, Large. I think between both I got most of the matting out but I think I prefer the Miracle coat slicker dog brush over this one. I actually haven't used it since that first time.The rotating bristles do help untangle the mats to some degree but on some, I felt that it would just get stuck on them and I was I had to do over and over to work my way through it and it pulls on it from the skin so my dog just kept looking at me wanting to get up. For small knots, I guess for the smaller knots if worked ok and easily undid them. Maybe if the fur was really coarse and dense this would be the better choice but for me, it just didn't do as much as the slicker brush.I felt that the thinner sharper teeth of the slicker brush worked better for me, because they were so thin they could also get down to his undercoat easily. For the mats, you can gently work your way through the matting (assuming your dog can wait patiently) from the end of the hair not the skin, so you don't end up pulling on him so much, and it does a quick job of small mats. I end up using it as a brush to get rid of the small knots before they become a bigger problem. With the slicker brush, you have to be careful not to apply too much pressure because of the sharp teeth."
"This is so handy to have when walking my dog. I can put a lot of stuff in here...keys, money, poop bags, just everything you might need on a walk. It's especially great for women whose clothing doesn't always have pockets like guys' clothing does."
"My black lab tore this up within the first hour of play. It is not durable, just slightly more durable than a regular plastic frisbee. You will waste your money if your dog is hard on toys! Another down side to this frisbee is the color, it is a translucent white, making it kind of difficult to find if you throw it far. The Kong one lasted at our house for several months and it is approximately the same price."
I love da bird cat toy. It is one of the only toys that gets my cat to do a backflip three feet in the air. Replacement feathers come in handy because my cat tends to tear apart the bird.
"Many posts have been made on various forums regarding the noise of the pump that comes with the Biorb. In my case, with the Baby Biorb, our pump got progressively louder until I finally embarked upon an exploratory dive into the pump's internal workings.Much to my amazement I found it very easy to squelch the noise problem. Actually I ended up with a pump quieter than it was when it was brand new. I found part of the pump apparatus was vibrating against the case causing the loud buzzing sound. The fix was very simple.Step 1- Unplug the pump and remove the four screws found underneath the unit. You can now easily remove the cover. Inside you will see basically two components, the electrical motor and the pump apparatus (the piece with the rubber baffle attached).You may want to plug the pump in at this point being careful not to touch anything that might shock you inside the cover. At this point with the air tube detached from the unit you will probably find it relatively quiet. Put your finger over the fitting the air tube going to the Biorb attached to. You should observe the vibrating rubber pump apparatus begin vibrating more vigorously and perhaps make a louder noise. Now unplug the unit and proceed to the next step.Step 2- Look down between the two internal components and you will see another screw which you should remove. The pump mechanism will lift right out. From the middle of the rubber baffle you will see a small threaded rod with a small nut attached. Tighten this nut first. Then using a Drimmel tool, a metal file or a sturdy pair of wire cutters cut off or remove some of the end of the threaded rod the nut is screwed on to. Not the whole way down to the nut but about half way. You will not be removing very much metal at all. You may want to glue the nut to the rod to keep it from backing off again. I didn't do this but the thought crossed my mind as I prepared this guide.Anyway, the threaded rod is the culprit. As the screw backed off, the rod got closer to the side of the case and the noise was generated by it vibrating against the case. Tightening the screw doesn't allow as much vibration and shortening the threaded piece keeps it from hitting the side of the case at all.Step 3- Insert the pump mechanism back into the case with the single screw. You may now test it again if you wish before putting the cover back on. Reassemble and test again remembering to place your finger over the hole the air tube attaches to and hopefully you will find your pump is nice and quiet.If you find this fix helpful please do not hesitate to donate $1 via Paypal. This is a whole lot less than a new noisy pump. It also provides me with incentive to continue developing fixes for those irritating little annoyances life throws at us. Let me know if you run into any issues. [...]"
Feliway works exceptionally well and the price here is unbeatable. It is not an inexpensive product but the savings buying it here makes it much less of a hit on the wallet. It is also hard to find out at the usual stores. I suspect that it is due to low demand due to the high price per unit and you never seem to be able to just get the refills.
Every time I added a new plant my aquarium it developed yellow and brown spots and eventually died. Leaf Cure solved this problem! I immediately saw and improvement in the plants minutes after I added the solution to my Tank. Plants are now looking greener and healthier.
Our cat likes it and has played all around it - lol - but I'm working on getting her to use it still. Last night I baited the top of it with little slivers of turkey and she climbed up it to get them. This morning she used it for the first time in its intended manner so I have high hopes. I set her on top of it once or twice a day just so she can get a view of her &#34;domain&#34; and will hopefully begin the perch there on her own. This is very made very sturdy.
"This cat food ingredients are -Water sufficient for Processing, Meat By-Products, Chicken, Beef, Liver, Ocean Fish, Rice Flour, Guar Gum, Calcium Carbonate, Carrageenan, Locust Bean Gum, Potassium Citrate, Brewers Dried Yeast, Vegetable Oil, Iron Oxide, Taurine, Vitamin E Supplement, Choline Chloride, Zinc Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate, Ferrous Sulfate, Niacinamide, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Copper Sulfate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Manganous Oxide, Vitamin A Acetate, Biotin, D-Activated Animal Sterol (Source of Vitamin D3), Vitamin B12 Supplement"".It is unfortunate that this has meat by-products as the largest portion of the protein it contains. I do not doubt the value of fresh caught prey's ""innards"", but I do doubt the quality of what any cat food company is using, when they list it as ""by-products"". However...this food does have the pluses of being an available, non-prescription food, one that is not only lower in protein and phosphorus, but one which per a support list I was on for owners of CRF kitties, extremely popular with some cats."
"I purchased this shampoo on the recommendation of my vet's assistant, and it did just what I wanted it to. It made my dog's coat shine, greatly lessened the shedding, calmed his red skin and smells good, too. I'll order again from this seller if possible."
"This collar works, but in my case my dog, a medium size dog, was terrified the first 3 days, that really hurts if you charge it complete. I discharge the product every time that I take it off from my dog, I just used this collar for 3 days and she changes a lot!, no bakrs anymore! But I recommend first try to used the cytronela collar and other products that Not Hurts too much your dog, and if not result then used this, BUT NOT IN SMALL DOGS...I try on me and JESUSCRIST! it hurts a lot! Then I decided to put tape on one of the irons things and discharged the product before I put it on my dog and IN THAT WAY that doesnt hurts too much, because she dont scream, jump and cry, she just feel the prick in one of the sides and stop barking and look at me like what happend!I just used it 3 days at the beginning and then I stop it because it works, then like a month after I just show her the collar when she began to bark like a recordatory and she look it and run and stop barking and be a good girl.Other thing is that she was terrified at the beginning because she feel the prick on the yard, so she was afraid to go out to do her business and also to the front door, but then she realize what is going on and she totally forgot.Dont put the collar to your dog if he or she is going to be alone.PD"
"The track and ball are durable and well made, though I think the light-up ball makes it more fun. My cat plays with this every now and then and he pretty much always has access to it. Of course, only bringing it out occasionally will help maintain its novelty.If purchasing it primarily for the scratchpad (unlikely, but you never know) I must say that I have only seen my cat use it a couple of times; he likes corrugated cardboard, but prefers a longer rectangular scratchpad or his scratching post. I would say this is a pretty safe buy for younger, playful cats. As far as its value as an exerciser, I'm not so sure, I suppose it depends on how aggressive of a player your cat is - if you are trying to get your cat to lose weight, I recommend a laser pointer, though this would be nice to leave for him/her while you are out. Amazon has it very nicely priced at $12.60 right now."
Finally a water dish my dog finds more interesting than the toilet. The only negative is it is more time consuming to clean than a regular dish. It has to be taken apart once a week to remove dog hair and other debris that gets caught in the mechanism that circulates the water. It's not difficult to do and cleaning the dish takes less than five minutes.
"Arrived promptly. I purchased 2 of these in small for my little shiz tu doggies. Probably should have bought extra small as they fit too large around the body but I am going to buy some velcro to help with that. They are made super nice, very soft and plush. I am very happy with this purchase and got them for a great deal! Many thanks to Fashion Pet!"
Puppies love it for chewing and tug of war. Takes them a little longer to distroy it than other similar toys.
"Great Product, exactly what I needed and ordered.Combined with excellent service and a speedy delivery!Will order again from them!"
This product works better than I expected. It stopped the itching and improved her coat. We are both a lot happier now..
The size of this is a little bigger then a babies hand. I got some ugly color the listing does not say random color choosen or what not. Most of the feathers was off mine & not loose in the box. So i take it they fell out before packaged. Really poorly made. This will go in the trash since it is to small & do not want my cat choking on feathers which pluck out so easy.
I recommend this product to anyone with dogs that are aging and/or have arthritis. My 15 year old dog runs around like a puppy and is pain free!
I originally purchased the pill pockets so I could give medication to my kittie Sasha. They worked well for that purpose. Now that Sasha no longer is on medication I give her 3 of the Greenies Pill Pockets just as a treat for being a good girl when I trim her nails. She LOVES them!!! :) I have another kittie named Mazy but she doesn't like kittie treats of any type. That's OK because Sasha wants them all for herself anyway! Two paws up for this product. :)
"Both my cats adore this toy/scratcher! the color I recieved is royal blue, not my first choice but it isn't bad. I will be needing a replacement for the center shortly as both cats use it almost constantly."
"This is a FANTASTIC toy! I have a lot of experience with it as I volunteer regularly in an animal shelter, and Da Bird is a huge hit there. My own cat is intimidated by the bird so I use the mouse attachment (Cat Catcher) with her. It's great that the ends are detachable so you can switch out the attachments. The birds won't last forever if your cat is a real ""bird"" killer, whereas the mouse lasts a really long time.I am, however, very disappointed to see the huge price increase by this seller (""Da Bird""). I bought this not too long ago for $7.50 and it's already up to almost $18! YIKES! I'll be shopping around as I know I can find a much better deal for those shelter kitties."
The Bark Free Dog Training Device did not work so well. When it was set to the annoying sound humans can hear the neighbors could also hear it. This worked a bit but I didn't want to offend my neighbors with the sound. When the device was on the ultrasound that only dogs could hear it did nothing. 2 beagles were not stopped in their tracks by this device.
Finally decided to splurge on one of these. The dog loves it! He would now rather have a treat in the Kong than just have a milk bone handed to him!
"After overpaying for this at the vet I decided to try to save some money buying this online. After receiving it I found the packaging different than the one we have been purchasing. The vials of liquid were not marked and were very different from what I was used to. We reluctantly applied it and had no issues, but I would be hesitant to order this product online again. I have gone back to buying from my vet or local pet store."
"This reactor is poorly designed and requires far too much work to clean. If the bottom sponge become clogged, you must remove all of the media to get to the bottom sponge. Why wasn't this designed with the ability to remove both the top lid AND bottom lid? If the top sponge becomes clogged it pushes the media up through the exit flow and into the tube. This brand seems to have a loyal group of followers who can find no fault with any of these products and I bought it based on the reviews. Total waste of money and I have found an alternative design that works much better for me."
"It worked wonderfully to prevent my male cat from spraying. I used it in conjunction with the plug in. It also worked fairly well to calm my cats around my husband...whom they fear because he is big guy, loud voice, fast pace. They still didn't calm down a great deal but it helped a bit. The only issue I have is the smell can come off kinda funny & stinky but it isn't horribly bad by any means & the smell goes away within 15 minutes of spraying. If your problem is a cat marking with urine then this would be a great product to help you."
"I didn't realize the work it would be to put one of these in, and I'm not a handyman at all; I don't think I had ever picked up a skill saw before in my life. But I did it, with no help, and I was really proud when I got it all set up. It is very, very sturdy and works well."
It was very easy to attach the saddle bag to the leash. It does not get in the way of holding onto the retractable leash. THere are four pockets to put anything in. It is really handy!
"I am always looking for a good quality rope toy. On this one, the rope came out the first time we used it."
"Good idea, poor execution?I have two ferrets. One of them discovered she could climb out of this pen using the horizontal bars in and around the sliding door as a ladder. Once she learned how, she was out as soon as you gave her five uninterrupted minutes."
"Middle aged stubborn kitty who insists on sleeping outside in the cold carport, appears to love this bed.I started out with a regular heating pad - they get too hot and turn off automatically. This one only heats when thekitty is on it and does not need to be turned off and on."
"Saw the TV commercial for sifting liners and then found these on amazon. These are okay and do what they say, but take too long to sift more holes, or larger holes would help. Otherwise, prompt shipping and service from Amazon"
"Angel Eyes is amazing... works just fantastic on our White Bishon, no more red, runny eyes... but you must keep it up...if you stop it all comes back."
"I use Frontline on my dogs in the summer time to stave off those nasty ticks. It does this job very, very well. Also works to keep them flea free.In the winter I use a different brand that combats ear mites and fleas but in the summer, this is the stuff you want to have on hand. Trust me, you do not EVER want you or your pet to suffer from the Lyme disease that ticks carry."
"a little cheaper than I though..it puts a lot of force on the wood in a door way, could easily cause damage. nice idea, but didn't work as I though... purchased it but probably wont use it... sticking to the cheap $10 one I have"
"I just got this product yesterday and have already taken my dog on three walks. She is a little fussy when I first put it on her, but her pulling stopped on the first walk! I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a bit complicated to get on. I'm never really sure I have put it on right. The DVD is a bit repetitive, but clear. I would reccommend this to every dog owner I know! Great product!"
Works well for three months after a good vacuming. Kind of bug spray smelling for awhile. I cannot find a better product.
Well I figured I would give these a go. Dogs tend to love anything that squeaks and of course the tennis ball feel brings back fairly good memories of lots of fuzzy broken balls.I think it is important to stress that these footballs are not chew toys. They are designed to be interactive play between yourself and dog. So long as this is adhered to the ball will last a fair while.my dogs LOVE this toy- the squeak and the bounce seem to captivate them. Pretty good price for the toy also.Highly recommend.
"I had one of these brushes for a previous cat. I gave it away when my cat died. I had no luck (pet stores, Walmart,etc)trying to get one for my present cat. I discovered it on line in a couple of places but their shipping charges were so high that I wouldn't consider buying from them. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. It was delivered quickly and just as featured. My cat hasn't used it much yet, but I'm sure as he gets used to it he'll enjoy it just as much as my other cat did."
The pellets are small. The guppies like it. It floats long enough to be mostly consumed. I will buy again (I wish it came in larger quantities).
"My dog loves this toy, it is now her favorite also it's not obnoxiously loud either. I do remember Mr. Bill from Saturday Night live and that's probably why I enjoy it."
"With an 80 pound lab that has trouble standing and going up and down stairs, this item has been a godsend. I can easily lift her into a standing position and help her walk if needed. I would heartily recommend if your dog needs mobility assistance."
"You get what you pay for. Sometimes you get lucky but most of the time you don't. We made a bad choice with this one. The back is held together with sticky tabs (like command) No screws. This isn't some temporary thing we're putting on the door, it has to last a long time. Not even going to try to put this on our door."
"I bought this about 4 months ago for my two cats. I have mixed feelings, but I am keeping it. I had very little trouble programming it and setting it up. Once you get the hang of it it only takes a few minutes to adjust the settings. I bought it for weekend trips out of town and it's great because I set it for two daily feedings and when you get home you can see how many meals were dispensed on the display.So I have two cats. One greedy fatty and one slim jim. Greedy fatty likes to lay next to the feeder with her belly sprawled out on the floor and her hand in the feed dispenser. She wiggles her paw in there and a few pieces fall out. I figured that this was a small amount of food, but it is high calorie food and it seems like she does it while I am not home an awful lot because she has gained at least 2 pounds since we got it. The other cat eats when the food comes out and leaves it alone the rest of the time. I now only use it for the morning meal so that they will eat early and let me sleep and then I put it away all day in the closet, feed them wet food at night (fatty gets about an 1/8 teaspoon) and put the feeder out before bed.I should only use this for vacations. I heard there is a way to rig it so they can't get the food out with their paw, and that is what I am online to find now. I left them with the feeder and plenty of water for 4 nights and when I got home the feeder was on and in tact. It has been running and feeding daily since I first set it up for about 4 months now. Only concern is for my clever chubby kitty."
"I've been using the Littler Robot Eco Edition for about a week. Let me say that first off the notion that your house will smell better is rubbish. This thing stinks like any other litter box. The waste isn't delivered into some hermetically sealed container where the smell doesn't escape. It's just a plastic bin.It also still requires work just like any other litter box. I take that back, not like any other litter box. You have to clean the dome, you have to clean the rubbish bin.Does this save you money? I don't think so. It uses electricity which a normal litter box does not use. It also still uses litter. And so far it seems to use more litter. Although my cats are still curious so they maybe contributing to the litter issue. It uses electricity.There's also the potential for break down. And purchasing the replacement parts are going to be more than buying a new litter box.On the positive side I haven't had any mechanical/electronic issues. The thing does clean itself. But overall I can think of plenty of things that are a better value."
"We have a 6 month ago pit bull puppy and this toy didnt even last a day, or 2 hours for that matter. He tore the plastic and the treats fell out. I do not recommend this toy unless you have a dog that doesnt chew."
"This product came out of the box, put on the couch and my 7lb chihuahua went right to sleep in it (top unzipped and front unzipped). WE are going on a trip in 3 weeks so I wanted her to get comfortable and used to it. I like the way it is square. It is a wonderful product."
"I have a terrier mix who would go nuts if people came to the door or in the middle of the night if deer walked by. Less than one day on the collar and his barking is minimal. I left it on for a few days and he barks nowhere near he used to! Now, I just put it on when we're expecting company. The smell is a little overwhelming, but I only get a good whiff if he's up near my face; otherwise, it's not too bad. The replacement battery was around six dollars at Petsmart and lasts forever, as long as you remember to turn the device off when not in use! The package also comes with an entire additional can of citronella and I'm nowhere near done with the first one. I wouldn't recommend this product for breeds that are known for talking, such as shelties or hounds, but for any others it is a great way to get the barking under control!"
"I have two poodles, a miniature and a toy poodle and of all the balls they have this is their favorite and the only one they play with. I found these balls originally in Dominick's Food Stores however when I went to buy a couple this year none of the Dominick's had these balls. I went to four different Dominicks until my daughter suggested trying Amazon or eBay. I was estatic to find these same balls on Amazon. These are the perfect balls for small size dogs. My dogs are happy and I am happy being able to find these balls on Amazon. My little toy poodle loves when I put this ball in their swimming pool because she will jump in the pool to get her ball. She enjoys playing this game of retrieving the ball out of the pool. My miniature poodle however won't go into the pool to retrieve her ball but she will wait for it to float to the edge or she will put one paw in to move it closer to the edge. I just can't say enough about these balls and how much both my dogs love them. They each get a new ball for their birthdays and my miniature poodle already is playing with this ball I purchased from Amazon and my toy poodle will get hers later this month. They look so adorable running with this ball in their mouths since it is a very soft ball and the perfect size for small dogs."
Really works great on the dog. And she loves to get combed. Amazing how much fur comes out. Cat is not so crazy about it. I read the bad reviews and think the people that are saying it rips the hair out are using it wrong. There is a certain angle that works best. Could be different for every animal.
We have 9 cats and use these everyday. Cats love them. We go through several a month. They like the duck also.
"This is the most awesome dog car seat ever! I can put my 2 dogs in it and strap them in for security and off we go! They love it cause they can look out the window and see everything, or lay down when they get sleepy, and I like because they are safe and secure. Would recommend this dog car seat!"
Background
"This product is absolutely insane. It harms the cats and yet is a paradise for the fleas. AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!. I had the misfortune of buying this product for my cats at Wal-Mart rather innocently since at that particular store it was the only anti-flea products on the shelf. Immediately upon applying it on my cats, all six of them and not all of them related to each other, became sluggish and listless. I thought it only temporary but it lasted on until the next day, to the point where they weren't even eating their food or even getting up off of the floor. Fearing for my pets I decided something was the matter and I bathed them in order to get the stuff off of them. I noticed that as soon as I bathed them my cats' energy levels started improving. I commented on it to a friend of mine and she said their Aunt's cat died from a Hartz anti-flea product right in front of their young cousins and everything. The poor cat had a seizure and died. So in short, this stuff kills the cats . . . . but not the fleas! I ended up having to bathe my cats for a second time in order to get rid of the fleas that the Hartz application hadn't even affected. So while it may be reasonably priced it is cheap for a reason, it is lethal to the cats and harmless to the fleas. AVOID IT!!!!!!!!!"
It was an ok product until my Dutch Shepherd destroyed it in about a day after I received it. I can't find a toy that he doesn't destroy.
This product is universally recognized as the best product for feeding newborn kittens that for whatever reason are not nursing off of their mother. This is an ideal product for a cat shelter or rescue but i would not recommend it for a single user...its too much food. Its a balanced diet for a litte kitten. They love this stuff....Make sure to buy feeding bottles as it is not included with this product.
I received this today and absolutely love it! This item was packed very securely and was easy to assemble. I needed to purchase a kitty litter tray that would fit properly. The box looks great in my bathroom. I really love this. It looks so much better than my old eye sore of a kitty litter box.
I love this leash! It allows my dog to kind of wander about but I still have control of her! Just be careful not to get your fingers wrapped up or you might get hurt!
This thing really works well. Tigger our cat likes us to use it on him.
"Great quality crate! Easy to put together, affordable, fits in nicely with the decor of the living room and, most importantly, our dog likes it!"
"I have used this product on all my aging dogs, and it reversed their cataracts for quite a long time, but usually with time they return after awhile, and are no longer reversable. With these drops they get another year or two of sight; which to a dogs life is a really long time. So, with the use of these drops my dogs spend a much shorter time completely blind before they pass away from their old age diseases.My problem was always the cost; I paid $121. a bottle for years. Considering I was using it on multiple dogs it got to be very pricy in a hurry. The last 2 bottles I got from my vet were $63. and $60. Now that I see it on Amazon for much less I will be buying it here.I must say though that a LOT of the product gets wasted due to multiple drops coming out at one time, and solution running down the bottle. I have used other eye drops on my dogs (that were not for this purpose) and those bottles dispensed one drop at a time with no problems like this. I really think they could make a better dispensing bottle that wouldn't waste so much costly product."
These were on sale orginal price was 59.95 for 6.25.I thought they would be bigger and thicker.They are very small and hardly worth the sale price the 59.95 as orginal price is a joke they should take that off the ad
"I was really not sure that this would work. When i finally recd it, with a barking dog 2 day shipping seemed like forever, and put it on our dog she loved it. Then she barked.....then she yelped once. That lasted less than a day. The next day all we had to do is show it to her and she stopped the barking, now very rarely does she bark and it is one bark and thats all. Money well spent. I am thinking of giving it to my neighbor!! This is the best device i have ever used. it is sitting in the drawer now most likely never to be used again."
"My little monster man just loves these rings. He's particular to the one with the 3 areas of fringe on it and carries it around in his mouth, bats it, tosses it, and will catch it clean out of the air. It's absolutely one of his favorite toys and it's been very durable for us - lasting 2 years now with the fringe intact. He's really not that into the fringe, but the ring part, he just loves.His sister will also occasionally play with this. She doesn't love it the way that he does, but every once in awhile, she'll pull it out and play with it. In part, I think, to drive him nuts. But we've bought two pairs of these and they definitely get used!"
My dog really gets excited for these treats. She likes the other Blue Dog Bakery treats too...but she especially likes these. They are small so they make great training treats.
"I ordered 2 bottles of the 365 tablets. They arrived timely. However, one bottle had opened in transit and the vitamins were loose all over the inside of the box. There needs to be a safety seal of some sort added to the bottles. Overall, I'm happy with the vitamins."
I`m really surprised that some report their cats have no interest. I`ve always had multiple cats and so I have a number of these scattered around the house. One of my cats loves to play with two at a time. He hits one and then the other and rolls over to the first and back to the second keeping both balls going at the same time. I always recommend this to new cat owners who are looking for toys and scratching devices. It`s a must have!
"This is my second one and this ball is great for an aggressive chewer. Had to buy another one so two of my three will quit fighting over who gets this ball. I fill mine with treats for my crated puppy to keep him busy all day. He's a german shepherd,10 months, and 81lbs. It has alot of chew marks but still holding up. This is also a great price they are twenty plus on the stores."
"This dog bed is very well made. It has held up to one of our large dogs scratching out a net before he lays down. The sides are stuffed nicely, but the bottom is thin so it's not designed for a dog with joint problems. For the money, it was a very good choice for us."
"When I received the prefilter I was hoping to use it as an external filter before it got to the aqualifter. Unfortunately, it leaked, and there went that idea right out the window.I should note that I was trying to get a low volume of water movement out of this pump/prefilter setup. I simply needed to move water around in my very small (2.5 gallon) aquarium. It is a shrimp tank.I found that using the &#34;aqualifter&#34; by itself (without the preflter) lead to diminished water circulation. At the end of a 24 hour period the water circulation was only a drip. The pump seemed strained (like it was working hard).I still use the &#34;aqualifter&#34; to transfer clean (and only clean) water to the tanks I have. I simply don't use the prefilter.In all honesty, What I was looking for was a filter that would circulate a small volume of water for a small (2.5 gallon) tank. I did not want the noise of an air pump with an air stone. In the end I settled for the &#34;Azoo palm filter&#34; which has a regulator that can redue the flow to much less than any other pump I found (and it's cheap). The specs say something like 17 gal per hour. (your milage may vary). I should mention that I am quite happy, the tank I have is at the moment at the foot of my bed and after a little getting used to, does not keep me awake"
"When I met my last rescue pet, Dixie, approximately 6.5 years ago, she was a real mess--both externally and internally. She exhibited a nervous condition {G.E.R.D.} that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions; that is to say, that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up! She was painfully emaciated, skeletal almost, and her blood-work was all over the place. So, after a round of IV fluids and 2 bags of 'Science Diet' chow, Dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home. The first thing I did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition; I knew that I didn't want to keep her on the 'Science Diet' regimen--it's too full of ingredients that I feel don't belong in a proper diet for dogs. Lo' and behold, I stumbled upon the ""Nature's Variety Instinct"" formula for dogs. It seemed like a good fit, due to all of the proper ratios {protein/fat} and totally 'GRAIN-FREE"". Viola! The rest, as they say, is history.... 6.5 years later, Dixie now weighs in at approximately 20 loving, happy pounds of my friendly and well-adjusted best friend."
"The fish love it, stay healthy, live long and prosper. We have two ponds with approximately 90 total goldfish, 2"" to 8"" long, some plain, some fancy. We sure haven't seen any problems with ""air bubbles trapped within their bodies."" The fish have been living on it for over five years, so I think it's pretty good stuff."
"Our dog park uses this brand and we are impressed. Strong, durable, environmentally friendly, and relatively inexpensive. If you go to the mutt mitt website there are other products to buy as well, and some deals on bulk ordering."
This is the best thing since chocolate covered pretzels!!!! I can't believe I didn't discover this until now. I'm thinking I may have to use this on the cats themselves...
"We bought our first Drinkwell at a garage sale so I don't know how old it was. We used it for several years and then the motor got really loud and one day it stopped working. We took it apart and broke some parts. It was only a few dollars more to get a whole new one, so we read the reports and got a new one. It was very loud at first. After reading other reviews, we have started to use only distilled water in this new one. My cat loves it!! We are not very good at maintenance issues and hope it lasts a long time even if we don't clean it out weekly."
"We have rental property that was abandoned and when we went in to inspect, OMG, the worst flea infestation I have ever seen. A relative bombed the house 2 times with another product with no success. I bought the Knockout from Amazon and there is not a living flea in this house. Don't waste you money with anything else."
This produst really works. It took only 5-7 days before we noticed a difference in our dog's eye stains. I did just what the jar said.
"My wife and I have two cats (both neutered males) and one of them has been bothered by recurring urinary tract infections. On the last trip to the Vet, he advised us to get a cat drinking fountain in addition to going to a special Hills prescription diet. We selected the Hagen Catit drinking fountain at our local PetCo store. Unfortunately, the Amazon price, as listed here, is about $10 cheaper, so you know what I'd advise doing.The fountain was easy to put together and was functioning in no time at all. The regular cleaning part is going to become onerous, I can tell. It goes way beyond putting the old watering bowl in the dishwasher. Be aware. The cats took to the fountain immediately, but I still haven't seen either one drinking by licking the dome. In any case, they seem to be getting adequately hydrated judging by the drop in water level and the number of clumps appearing in the litter box. Hopefully, this fountain will be an aid to the UTI.Gary Peterson"
"Unfortunately my puggles did not enjoy riding in these trailers. I think it would be wise for the first trip in them to do a nice short route to get them used to it. I think we may have ruined it by taking them for a mile and a half ride the first time out. They probably started to think they were never going to get out. Contradicting other reviews, you can definately tell you are pulling the dogs. Each of my puggles weigh 33 pounds and I would not recommend trying to fit two dogs that size into one medium trailer. We bought two and it was the way to go had it worked out."
My ultimate destruction machine Alex (my Yellow Lab) can't destroy this toy! Large enough for him to carry around and tough enough to stand up to his destructive nature
"as part of our daily routine, we give our 9 rabbits one as a treat every night. They are really happy to receive them."
I have had this system for about four years and love it. I needed an extra collar for a new dog and it works great.
"Sophie dog enjoys this toy. She quickly figured out how to get the eggs out of the platapus, throw them up in the air and squeek the eggs. I'm busy putting the eggs back inside so she can take them out again. These type of toys seem good for her mental agility."
"The squirrel lasted less than 48 hours. Generally the least expensive stuffed toys from pet stores last 3 to 4 months before the fabric rips. My dog likes to ""kill"" the toy, have someone throw it, retrieve it, play tug-of-war and start the process again. In a matter of minutes the fur was coming off. After the third or forth ""kill,"" stuffing was flying all over the living room. Never have I bought a toy that fell apart as quickly as did this squirrel. I will sew the rips and see if we can get another few hours of play as my dog really liked the toy."
"My puppy hates baths and I thought I would try this waterless shampoo as an alternative to a bath. I used the product exactly as per the instructions but it didnt clean my puppy one bit! He is pure white, so it is pretty easy to see if a product has helped clean him up or not.The only reason I have given it two stars is that it is like using a good conditioner. It makes my puppy's fur very smooth and soft and makes him smell really good!"
"I bought this for my 37 gallon tank and it does not work as stated. It sucks out the water, but fails to lift the debris from the tank. I did the up and down motion, and it would not work to suck out the leftover food. What it did do is dislodge my plants and wreak general havok on my aquarium, while failing to clean it. I could see it dislodging the debris, but no matter how many times I tried, I could not get it to suck up the debris. It works fine for a water change, but not for actual cleaning. I will be returning this to the store and buying something else."
"i almost got rid of my puppy before i got this collar, the neighbors were complaining about him and he was driving me nuts - this product has helped so much with his constant need to hear himself bark - don't get me wrong he still barks, he just doesn't bark incessantly anymore -if you are at your wits end - get one!"
"I bought this device to distract my dog from barking long enough for him to be able to listen to my command to stop barking. For that purpose it works great...but I found another great use for it. Long distance recalls.I find it ironic that a device meant to scare away dogs, sends mine flying towards it to investigate the source of such a curious noise. One tap of the button he bolts over to me, holding it down just makes him wag his tail and circle me.In order to test this on a larger control group, I brought it to my local dog park, sat in the corner, and gave it a tap. In seconds every dog in the park was running over to me.I high discourage anyone from buying this device if they intend to use it to scare away violent dogs, as it is essentially an electronic dog whistle.I can upload a video to demonstrate this behavior if anyone likes."
This collar works very well. I like it because I have the control of the choke collar as well as a place for his tags. Also he can't ditch it like he used to with the choke chain.
"Okay, it does work great for eliminating skunk odor from metals and surfaces but it smells sort of like vomit. Which is worse? The skunk smell. It used to get so bad under our house that we had to leave. Skunk spray sticks to anything that is metal like your keys and doorknobs so you walk around all day smelling like skunk. This product gets rid of that smell quickly but then you smell like you partied too hard the night before. Fortunately the smell does disappear after a while whereas skunk smell will stick around for days. I'd still take that smell any day over the smell of skunk!"
"After a few weeks, these are still in good shape on our lab and border collie mix. The clips seem durable too."
"It took my dog under 10 minutes to completely destroy this toy. He had pieces chewed off of it so fast, it was amazing. I put it in the garbage in under 10 minutes on Christmas morning."
"For the money its a great value, however you cannot use the mounting legs with a glass top, I prefer no top anyways so it worked great for me."
"This hunk of plastic is about the consistency of a piece of marble. I can't imagine any dog chewing on this. I don't know what product the positive reviewers received. Yes, this chew will last longer than other toys. I can certainly believe it is indestructible! Like a rock. My mastiff loves chewing pretty much anything but is completely uninterested in this.If you need something this indestructible and you think your dog will chew on something that is as hard as a rock, before you buy this chunk of plastic just try bringing a rock home. That's free. It might even be softer on the teeth than this thing."
This product was pure hype ... did absolutely NOTHING positive for my cat ... they should give us our money back !!!
"This was just the right height and works great , once you can convince your dog to use it. They need to adjust to the shorter step heighth."
"my adorable bichon/mini poodle had suddenly started waking up and barking when the newspaper was delivered. i even cancelled my subscription to the paper and my dog was still waking up and barking at things in the middle of the night. it had really become intolerable and i was becoming sleep-deprived despite trying everything to quiet him down. this collar worked like a charm! it startled the little guy the first time it sprayed like you wouldn't believe, and i had to stifle a laugh. he barked a second time that first night and that was it. he's only barked one other time in the week or so i've had it on him. one spray and he quiets down immediately, and now i'm getting some sleep and my incredibly patient neighbors won't hate me. my little rescue dog is back to being his adorable, playful self. he's even barking less during the day too when he doesn't have the collar on. i couldn't be happier."
"We keep this product on hand for our shelties. When they show signs of digestive upsets, we give it for a day or two, and it usually alleviates the problems."
"Our dog loves this. He is a super big chewer and although he has bitten off a few pieces of the bone, it is still intact and we just refill it with a Tablespoon of peanut butter spread around inside for him to have more enjoyment at times."
"Nylabones have long been my favorite chew toys for my big German Shepherds. The dogs love them, they last a long time and don't make a mess on my carpets. If my dogs take them outside, they can be washed and reused. The souper size is great for big, strong dogs and last several months even with daily chewing. I highly recommend Nylabone durable products."
"I'm really pleased with the product itself. I didn't had too much expectations because many reviews were extremely in favor, and others were very discouraging. I guess each one of us will have its own experience.So far we've had this product for about 2 months, and I can't complain. I haven't tested water resistance by pouring a gallon of water into it or having my dog pee inside the car, however when the dog has been wet from playing in the park, walking under the rain or walking on wet grass/mud the cover has behaved very well... no stains in the back seat, and it seems to handle very well small amounts of liquid and a humid dog. The cover is really easy to mount in the back seat (no more than 5 mins to mount/remove), the size is perfect for our Mazda 3, I still have to see if it fits the back seat of our FJ Cruiser, however i don't think it will have issues since its a standard size.It has two plastic cylinders that are placed between the seat cushion and the back rest of the back seat, they prevent the cover from moving around, making it sit still... Our dog moves around a lot and the cover is in the same place, covering the whole seat (no readjustments needed so far).We did wash the cover once, and luckily we didn't have any issues. We used cold water and a gentle cycle for washing and drying. We read the previous post, that mentioned that the cover fell apart after washing and we didn't wanted to take any chances.I' pleased with the purchase. I hope you find this review helpful"
I saw a grooming tech use one of these on my dog and couldn't believe how much loose fur it grabbed! This keeps all the loose fur off my carpets and furniture and my dog loves the way it feels as she is being groomed.
"My dogs need indestructable things or its gone within minutes....This will last and though they do not play with it often, when they do, I can tell it will last for a long time."
"I have two cats, Pepper and Dublin, who both absolutely love this cat toy. Pepper in particular, who it typically a very reserved, lady-like cat, goes nuts when we play with this toy. She'll be jumping into the air going after the feather, practically doing back flips to try and catch it! I learned the hard way that when we are done playing, I need to put the toy up where they can't get to it. Dublin, who I think may have some dog genes in him considering how much he loves to chew, chewed the feather to pieces in the first week we had the toy. Fortunately, it came with two spare feathers!"
"I've tried about 5 different automatic boxes over the years. This is the best one, and for the current price of $67, its a real steal. The newer LitterMaid boxes, with the metal rakes are unmitigated garbage. Avoid at all costs. This one is far from perfect, but it does a reasonably good job of at least maintaining a fresher box than the standard hand scoop type. It hardly ever gets stuck. About once a week I'll make sure the rakes are clear and I'll scoop out any remaining clumped litter from the bottom, etc. This takes all of 2 minutes.On a side note, if your litterbox smells, try Ever Clean cat litter. We've tried them all, and this stuff just plain rocks!! I won't use anything else now. The box has little to zero smell emanating from it from the day we started buying Ever Clean. I've found that its usually cheaper at Petsmart than Petco. The stuff is expensive compared to some of the other ""major"" brands, but its 10x more effective. You get what you pay for in this case."
I would not recommend this product to any pet owner. I had the feeder for one week before it broke the first time. When I recieved a new one that one lasted three weeks. The battery died once a week and 9v batteries are not that cheap. By the end of the third week with the second feeder it stopped operating completly. My cat got her paw pinched in the feeder when she tried to stop it because it just kept turning. It is a great idea for if you are going away or just to have your pet on a feeding schedule but I would suggest trying a different feeder.
"Look, nobode wants to do this job. This works well. Better then the claw type which is impossible to clean. This hoses down and does not take the grass with it. We hired a cleaning service and saw them use this and how fast they did it, now we do it for the cost of the items."
"When I got these toys today, the dog, a Cacachon, LOVED them. The dragon wasn't unwinding his tail for some reason, but the tongue came out just fine. The pup thought it was great fun, AND I THINK he liked the taste of the plastic. He played almost exclusively with the dragon until he pulled off its tongue and it no longer squeaked. I showed him how the octopus worked. At first it scared him a bit, but then he took it and, again, had a wonderful time playing with it, until he pulled off its legs. So, within a very short amount of time, I have two toys that are already in pieces and pretty useless.I also HIGHLY recommend that you watch your dog while playing with these. Once he pulled a piece off, he continued to chew on the pieces, not the body, and would have swallowed them.Overall, it was fun for him for an extremely small amount of time. So, for me, it was a waste of money. 5 stars for temporary fun. Zero stars for durability. Zero stars for good investment in a toy. Averaging it out, it's less than 2 stars."
"I have tried many dog shampoos over the years and this is the best shampoo. I have used it for probably 15 years! It leaves a nice scent that truly does last for up to two weeks. When I shampoo my dogs, I lather it in and let it sit for a few minutes. It makes them so soft and nice smelling. My dogs are indoor dogs that don't go outside much, so I am sure that helps them to stay smelling good for longer."
"I installed a PetSafe Classic Medium door frame in my house in 2001. The original flap had started to tear at the top edge just this spring (11 years later). I purchased the medium size of this flap and it's a perfect fit. Installation was very easy, just a few minutes work. Hopefully this one will last another 11 years!"
"This is the 3rd Littermaid that I have purchased. My experience with these products have always been positive in the past, but they do wear out about every 4 or 5 years. My only complaint on this new model is that the lid sometimes gets stuck in the open position and does'nt close automatically. It becomes an odor issue if you aren't there to close it manually. At the end of the day, it still beats scooping! And my cat loves it!!"
"My two female dogs absolutly adore the clutch ball. It is the third ball I have bought for them. It's the toughest toy they have. I have a rot/lab mix and a pit/lab mix and they are very rough with thier toys but these clutch balls last and last. My purchase was thoughtfully packaged and arrived in reasonable time.Thanks, Lisa Brown"
"My little guy has chewed through everything, fire hose, tuffy's plush toys- you name it he's torn through it within minutes. I had purchased this and he loves it- keeps him entertained for so long and it lasts for a long time as well but they are so hard to find and I love that grady's has a great price and that they carry it- I will be purchasing more to have on hand because it is totally worth it."
"I purchased this product for my 4 month old Bolognese pup who was having a terrible tearing problem which seemed to be worse in one eye. I could tell they were bothering him as he was always pawing at his eyes even after my cleaning them w/ a warm wash cloth daily. I popped for the large 120 gram bottle of Angle Eyes and started him off with 1/4 tsp daily. He wouldn't eat it when I sprinkled it over dry food so I bought some wet and started mixing everything together. Once I made this switch he ate it all and even licked the bowl. Now the product does take some time to work but within a month I noticed a marked difference. He's been on it about 6 weeks now and the pawing at the eyes has stopped, I only need to clean his eyes ever 3-4 days, and the discoloration is improving. After reading several other reviews I know I need to give this product more time to work fully but I must say, I'm sold."
"This products gets out just about everything, including blood and red wine. It even get's out older stains (but not previously washed stains). It's the only way I can keep my daughter's clothes looking clean and new. The only reason I didn't give it a 5star is becasue it says it can get out mildew, and it really doesn't. My husband threw a wet shirt in the laundry bin and it began to mildew. Kids n' Pets did get some of it out, but not enough that it should advertise mildew removal."
"The others reviews state its not all Aluminum, which is true and the hols for the screws will snap if you tighten to much, Do NOT use a drill to tighten the screws. Also if your walls are wider than standard 2x4's it will be too small... This would have been nice to know before I cut my walls so be prepared to get out the Aluminum tape to seal the gap between the two halves if you have 2x6 walls like I had to."
"This de-shedder works very very well. I really can't figure out how it works, but it combs my cat's coats, and produces wads of ""undercoat."" The undercoat pile is gray for both my cats. One is black, and one is a black and white mix. Curious.And, I certainly got a great price on mine!Thanks!"
"I don't review many things, but this one I felt compelled. In the past, I've had two german shepherds and now I have a 75lb 3-year old mutt who grew way too fast. We started with regular ""x-large"" dog beds, but by the time she was two, she looked like a giant on a tiny bed - head and feet always flopping over the sides.This bed is HUGE! She fits comfortably, even large enough for her to bring her ""friends"" in and sleep with her. The height & firmness of the bolster is perfect for her big ol head and she loves being on her bed more than anything! She was in it before we could even get it out of the box, and we've easily trained her that that's home-base during meal times and when she gets her snack.Last thing"
"Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting. After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach. We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic. At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms. I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had. Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to ""getting older"" or her ""hairball sensitivity"" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food. I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away. Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway. She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.Within two days, the diarrhea was gone. Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat. It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner. No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box. My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true. A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor. I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it. The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food. You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell. The wet food actually smells good, for cat food. We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken. I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit. So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.Bottom line? It's pricy, sure. But it's worth it for us. Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two. I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store. So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man."
I was greatly disappointed in these shears. I have two persian cats and two manx cats. these shears would not cut the matted manx fur and they grabbed the persian fur intermittently and pulled it. It did cut the top of cat ok but wasn't good on belly or legs.
This is an AWESOME lead!! I have had MANY different styles of leads and this is my FAVORITE!!!! Nice comfy handle and easy clip!!!!
"I bought this product as I have two Healers and wanted to take them for a walk at the same time and have a hand free. The Coupler is strong, well made, simple, and works just how it should. My dogs are medium sized- under 40 lbs each and so far it has worked really well. I am very happy with my purchase. It's made walking the dogs easier and safer, and the price was very reasonable."
I have been trying to find covers that fit a large can of dog food -- Found it! They fit perfect on the large cans.
"I agree with all the previous reviews, it works as advertised and it is overpriced (I got a nice discount here on Amazon)- but it's definitely thinning and trimming the hair, not just brushing it. Not that that's a bad thing, but no one is saying it, so I am.I bought the furminator because my cat is so hairy, not only was he clogging up the CatGenie toilet almost daily, he had mats under his arms and legs hairballs, and I am sorry to say his rear end area had poop stuck in the hairs. I brush him and I cut back the hair around his derriere (got that hint from some Bichon Frisee owners) and feed him hairball reducing food and give him hairball grease- it didn't help. This cat is only 4 years old and quite peppy and active and healthy, and yet he was clearly unable to manage his own hair. I wasn't looking forward to him getting older and it all getting worse.I have only had the furminator for about a week, and it is fabulous so far. I have been furminating him daily, getting about a cat's worth of hair each time. I will try to come back and update.But I can clearly see a cut edge on the hair fluffs I am removing. This is why they call it a ""blade"". Between the tines must be like a razor edge.Again, not that it's a bad thing, for my purposes anyway. My kitty was practically drowning in his own hair and he loves this furminator (he loves all the brushes). It's really a trimmer or thinner, not really a brush or comb. Kind of like the old combs they sold on TV years ago that trim as you comb. It does not shorten the length of the hair overall,just thins it out overall.And it is a pleasure now petting him, knowing I am coming away clean. (But I have to take a bath after I furminate him!)"
I bought this for my daughter's boston/corgi mix. She loves it and it is durable. My daughter has sent me pictures of her asleep with the hedgehog in her mouth.
"This Orange Ball is wonderful - if you are looking for a way to get your dog to eat slower, this or the Kong Wobbler is the way to go. The wobler is far more durable though, this is a soft plastic. If your dog chews up stuff, you can't leave this with them. The wobbler would take a hammer to damage. Both make excellent toys though - we have both. The wobbler for the dog that destroys things, and the OB for the one that doesn't!"
"After dealing with shredded potty pads that were too thin and leaked urine everywhere, I decided to try these pads. I was hesitant to get a washable pad, despite the fact its better on our environment, due to the concept of urine in my washing machine, but it hasn't been a problem at all.The pads can hold quite a bit of urine and reduce the smell, but they are not perfect. Over time, the moisture can sort of condensate, for lack of a better word, and cause moisture to build up underneath them. I noticed that my carpets felt damp and smelled like urine.To fix this, I purchased a washing machine tray in the same dimensions to place underneath the pads, and it worked gloriously. I now no longer have issues with my carpets getting urine in them and if there are any ""misses"" on the edges, the tray will pool the urine for easy clean-up. If you purchase these, I highly recommend purchasing a washing machine tray as an accessory.These are the trays I purchased from Amazon.Camco 20752 30-Inch by 32-Inch Washing Machine Pan, White"
"This is an excellent clipper when grooming and comes with many blade options to address all grooming needs. I researched dog grooming supplies and from my extensive research, I have found that professional groomers use this product line more over than other name brands."
"I have used this product for years and feel it is the best on the market. My review is for the company last order we had a glich with UPS, however this order was delivered in a timely mannor and with the service I have grown to expect from Pet Solutions and I might add that this company has the best price I have ever found, this coupled with the excellant service is why I always return to them for my pets needs."
"We got 2 Australian Shepherd puppies (Rudi & Trudi) at 6 weeks old. Trudi found part of an old Hartz Chew N' Clean left over from our old dachshunds who love them. She really enjoyed it & wouldn't share with brother. I went to purchase more & could not find them, so I had to google them. Now the puppies are 2 1/2 yrs. old and we have a 3rd Aussie (Abbi) that is 18 mos. The Hartz Chew N' Clean are their favorite chew. It's the only dog item they won't share. First I ordered 6, then 12 (8 months ago & have shared with friends), & now subscribed for 6 every 3 months, which I'm hoping will be enough. When the bones get small I toss & hand out new ones. We love them because they are totally digestible (they are not plastic-check the label), not full of fat, have smiple ingredients, & are not smelly or messy like other dog chews, plus being good for their teeth & gums. My Vet thought I had been brushing their teeth because they have almost no plaque or bad breath. We are sure the Hartz Chew N' Clean have saved many shoes from being chewed, especially at our house."
"I have two adult cats and three of these litter boxes. I have not gotten SOOOOO in agreement with what the books say and what ""they"" say is best for cats, to the point that I have a box for each cat and a spare ""just in case."" In fact, I am still one of those hard heads that uses one litter box for two kitties and figure that they had best deal with it. But, I still have three of these boxes because I used to have more cats.But the logic of this diatribe is that THESE BOXES ARE THE BEST. AND when I DID have 3 kitties who were not too friendly with one another, I was good enough to have a box for each. But, I know me and know that even though I now have only two cats who are content with one another, that some day, I will increase the kitty population within my home and will need all three again, so I hang onto all of them.The way I currently actually employ two of them on a rotational basis is as follows"
"When I found these I ordered 4. My Choc. Lab. will only play with this ball. I even have several others from this company, but this one is it!!!"
"Works great and is a good size for my cockatiel. I like that it is completely stainless steel, making it easy to clean and the safest for my bird's health. The hanger is not identical to the one pictured. The pictured hanger appears to be more square while the actual product is pointed/triangular where is hangs on the cage."
This is a great to engage your pooch's mind and body. It's really fun to watch them figure it out and master it.
This is a waste of money. We have been giving it to our maltese every morning in her food for a month now and it has not done anything for her tear stains. The only active ingredient is 100% beef liver and beef liver does not remove or prevent tear stains. Save your money.
"I bought this for my cats first birthday. I've had it for about a month. My cat loves it and uses it more and more everyday. Sometimes he'll just relax inside of it, but it's also perfect for him when he's in one of his spaz-tastic moods running around the apartment. He likes to run back and fourth through it on his laps around the room. I previously resisted buying him a tunnel because they all make that crinkly sound. However, from another review, I read that this one did not. Thank goodness, the review was accurate. He has some crinkly toys, but i have to put them up at night or when I'm not in a crinkly toy mood. ;) If you are like me and have deprived your cat of a tunnel because of the crinkly material most are made of, buy this tunnel! Your cat will love it and so will you."
"We have a small dog so I can't be certain of strength but it seems plenty sturdy.Easy to assemble and disassemble, 30 seconds or so with no tools.Easy to obtain mats or pads to fit on the bottom pan.Great value for my money."
"She loves it so much, this is the third one I bought her. She chews the ears off but still loves the rabbit."
"I hope I am one day able to say I love this product, but for now my cat will not go near it. I continue to pick her up and place her in it, but she just jumps right down. I guess I can praise it for making her hold her bladder until I let her outside."
fleas be ware . your gonna get it with this spray. this kills fleas and their eggs and works amazingly for carpet
"Great beds for a great price. Very sturdy, boxer weighing 100 lbs seems to be enjoying this bed and comfort."
"This is thin, soft, and lightweight rope.It is very soft and does unravel quickly compared to other rougher rope toys. However it is SO LIGHTWEIGHT that it's GREAT FOR CATS because it's easy for them to carry it around and play with it in 'cat ways.' I think a dog would need to be puppy toy dog or something. Just chewing for chewing-sake ('dog ways') would probably kill this toy too fast, but then dog teeth seem less sharp than cat teeth (which are scissor-like) - so I can't really offer dog advice.I undid the rope-loop from the orange rubber ring and double knotted two knots, so that the ring was stuck in the middle of a snake-like rope. The cats loved dragging the rope around and then stopping to have some chew time on the rubber ring. Eventually, the ring got so chewed, I was afraid it would break off, so I had to remove it. They still liked the rope for dragging and chewing. The rope lasted about 1 year until it got so unraveled I was afraid it was getting unsafe and I tossed it. (This was for 2 cats"
"I bought my dog many toys and most of them are in the trash before long, she loves toys but after a short wile she tears them to pieces, but this is a rugged toy yet soft enough for her to make it squeak easily, she has had this over a year now and plays with it very day, she loves it so much I bought her 3 more, so now she plays with what ever ones she wants.I get the big ones, I got one small one and she ripped it up fast.my dog is a medium size German short hair, my sister has bought a few of these for her large hunting dog and he loves them also.Ruffians are great toys."
"This brush does make a difference. First, if your dog is sensitive to brushing, this brush will not hurt as much, and the dog will be more patient. Second, the tips that are ground don't damage the coat as much as the cut pins would or the beveled pins would. Third, the ground tips do not damage the skin, that means less infections and less scratching.This is a good brush, if you choose the right size and pin length, and if you use a good technique this brush will work really well and it will last. This brush holds up pretty well. I've had 2 original series brushes (different sizes, one is oval 27mm, the other is oblong) for a year and I don't intend to replace them anytime soon."
Puppies with upset stomachs can cause quite a mess. Ours did and this product came through for us. It works as advertised.
Great toy for normal play. Our dog will gnaw on his for hours until we find little pieces of fur all over. He loves it.
These have a great variety in them and My dogs love these!! And this is the best way to buy in bulk for my dogs.
"Ok, for the price it is ok. Very low pile carpet glued to a cardboard backing, but the cats do use it! They prefer another one I got that is more expensive with rope too. I lay these on the floor and they use them with no problems versus hanging from a door knob."
"This clicker is too loud. I'm sure it would be fine in training my pet but everyone else in my house would also be hearing this clicker. I prefer:Karen Pryor i-Click Dog Training Clicker, 3 ClickersShe's the one who began clicker training and has an amazing book called:Don't Shoot the Dog!"
"Frontline is effective and very expensive. Amazon turned out to be the most convenient to order and had the lowest price to boot. One way to save money is to buy the next largest weight dose and use only half of each bottle per application. I also find that you can often skip a month if the tick population (or your outings to tick areas)is cyclically low at a given time. (True esp. in winters.) If I find one or two ticks per month, no frontline. If ticks are more frequent then the dog gets frontline. Not only does it save money this way, but you wind up ""poisoning"" the animal with dangerous chemicals less often. YMMV."
"Wow! I was never able to take my dog to a formal party before, and now I can! Thank goodness they finally made one!"
"These fit the 5.5 oz. cans of wet kitty food perfectly! Couldn't find these in local stores... if they had them they were always sold out. These are sturdy... nicely made, seal well, easy to remove, and cute! :) What more could you ask for? :)"
"Millet was falling apart, thought it would be more fresh. Birds still seem to like it. Will look somewhere else next time."
"I am shopping for our second Nobbly Wobbly Ball. I bought the first one in 2008. Molly loved it immediately, but she is a nut for balls. Molly is a 3-year-old wirehaired fox terrier, so maybe it lasted for three years because it is really for a large dog, she is a medium-size dog. The Nobbly Wobbly has been her second favorite toy, being out done for first place by a basketball which she pushes/chases/tosses, very funny. All other balls we've tried died quick deaths by puncture. The Nobbly Wobbly felt heavy to me. Molly retrieved it as long as I threw it. After about two years, the yellow strand broke at the joining point. It did not slow her down. I held the broken strand for throwing. Molly would sometimes hold the ball by the loose strand and shake it ""to death"" before dropping it at my feet. When our second WFT, now 4 1/2 months, joined us, and was big enough, they began playing with the Nobbly Wobbly as a tug toy as well as a chase toy. It works for them because they can get a strong hold on an indivual strand, but can't hold the entire ball in their mouths. When a second strand broke, it was destruction time. They play less with the two individual, now detached, strands, but Digger (the pup) chews on them like a teething toy. They play with the small center jingle ball. They play with the remaining linked strands, as a tug toy. I feel that I definitely got my money's worth. Again, maybe it works for us because it is a toy for a large dog, being used by medium-size dogs. Molly never seemed to have a problem with a bad smell or taste, as she has with some toys. I hope the product hasn't changed since our first one. I'll let you know."
"This is a great product. We have a large mixed breed dog who needs help with her joints. She loves these biscuits. They also seem to do the trick for her joints. I prefer the ones that are more of a bone shaped treat. They give her more of a tooth work out. We have not been able to find the ""bones"" treats since we first stumbled across them at a local pet food supply store. These are peanut shaped biscuits. The price from Amazon was great too."
"I love my dog, but i don't love sitting in the hair he sheds on the couch. I bought him a fluffy dog bed then put out this petsafe pawz away on my coffee table. We now have a dog free zone that my very stubborn dog respects. Going to get another disc for the halfway to keep him out of our beds. Would be good by the front door to keep him off guests when they are trying to walk in.To train him, i showed him the collar and got close to disc until it beeped and told him no. Then i put the collar on him and he steered clear of the area. Has not been on the couch once in the last five weeks. Believe me, i would see the hair if he had been, the couch is chocolate brown.Highly recommend, also i have petsafe inground pet fence, this collar makes him mind those boundaries since it is the same kind. Doesn't shock him out side but he thinks it will so i don't have to switch collars when he goes out"
Bought to trim a Newfoundland dog. Very thick fur and had issues with other trimmers pulling the fur. This one will go right threw any knots that are to close to the skin to brush.
"i have a yellow lab with very thick hair. i am glad i got the largest size comb. it takes less strokes. it certainly took a lot of the hair off. not sure if from the under coat or not, but i could easily make a big pile of dog hair."
"I have been using these pads for several years with great success until recently. My last box was packed differently and the pads are awful!!! My elderly dog has never ""missed"" a pad until this new box. Now the urine pools on top of the pad so she is wetting on the floor near the edge to avoid walking on the wet spots. These pads also leak!!! Never a problem for me in the past. The old pads would wick the urine away and leave the top dry for several days. These won't even hold one one incontinent episode. I am trying a new brand now, but trust me... these are no better than the blue pads you can buy at Dollar General for 1/4 the price."
"Both of my dogs loves these treats. One of the dogs will eat anything, but the other is very picky about dog biscuits and she gobbles these right up. The biscuits are in different shapes with different sizes. However,e ven the smallest one is probably about 1.5""x1.5"" so if you have a small dog, you'll probably want to break them apart first. They're a good size for medium or large dogs though."
"This toy box is probably the better ones I've seen. It's sturdy, deep (so you can fit quite a bit of toys inside), and the perfect height for your dog to grab toys from if/when you leave the lid off. The design is clever, and can be customizable as others have said with stickers and such. I highly recommend this product!!"
"I am a four year old black lab guide dog. It is essential in my line of work that I stay fit. You could have fooled me, low fat, really now, my nose knows no difference. I recommend these yummy treats to both working dogs like myself and other dogs looking for a healthy and ""good for you"" treat!!!"
the problem with this collar is that at first when my dog was a puppy he stayed in but then he got bigger and now he just runs out whenever he wants. So i had to put him on a chain and he justs sits in my back yard and can't do anything past 15yds of his chain. if you buy this make sure your dog is small enough.
"I just purchased these in 3 Pack of 3 pills each for my 3 cats, one of which definitely has worms. The directions... or lack thereof that are printed in the cardboard backing which I fully opened and read- are for ONE dose per weight. No where does it say how many times to dose the cat, or how often if given several doses. Why would the bottles contain 3 pills if only 1 is usually needed? It's very unclear. Unless one has a 40 lb cat, it makes no sense. I know when I had my cat on deworming pills through the vet (it didn't work, by the way) it was TWO doses. one was specifically one week after the other. I've also read online about deworming through pills such as these, and many people say they gave ""several doses."" I'm going to have to call the vet and see what he says. My cat (who was a feral cat now indoors) has worms so bad he throws them up! I want his suffering to end promptly, but I'm so confused! I'm going to give him one now anyway, just to get the ball rolling."
"We have a 5 month puppy who doesn't eat much and doesn't drink much. We mix this with dry food and chicken and it really helps with the hydration since he won't drink too much. He's healthy, has a nice coat, and seems to like this canned dog food."
Although the product description sait it will fit various cars and SUVs it doesn't stay in place well at all. We have a Ford Fusion which is fairly average in size for a sedan and we tried different ways to keep it in place but it just doesn't stay.
I have a 10 year old dog who at times does not care to eat. I give him one of these tablets per day on top of his food. I feel these tablets have helped to increase his appetite I don't want him to get sick because vet bills are out of this world. I would recommend these tablets especially to anyone who has a senior dog.
"I have a large, young Doberman with lots of energy. He needs a good walk every day to burn off some of that energy. I had trouble with him dragging me, not too terribly, but I worried about one day not having the control that I wanted. I tried just teaching and working with him to control the pulling. I tried chokers, which did nothing to help. I reluctantly tried a prong collar, but my conscious bothered me, not to mention my dog seemed to get used to the prongs and chose to ignore them. While walking him one day, we stopped to talk w/another dog and owner. The dog was an English Mastiff/Rottie mix and weighed 130 lb. He was wearing the easy walk harness and his 110 lb owner loved it. After that one testimony I ordered my 1st harness. It worked immediately. My dog walked comfortably at my side. One tug on the leash caused the harness to pull sideways, not backwards which causes a dog to resist by pulling forward. My dog once chewed through the harness at the front (I was ignoring him while chatting on a walk,)and I called Premier who advised me to send it back and they sent me a new harness. That amazes me. I have since bought my second harness because my first has again been chewed, and I don't want to be w/out it for a week while I send it back. I tell everyone I know about this. My 60 year old mother walks her 1yr old boxer w/no problem whatsoever. I love this and will use nothing else. I can't believe I ever bought a prong collar."
THE TEST SUBJECT
I purchased this product three weeks ago and love it.I have two little schnauzers and the yapped every time some one would come to the door now the bark for a second but hardly at all. This Item works and I highly recommend it if you have a dog barking problem.Al Martin
It was ok for my dog although for her to stay in it all night I had to put a blanket beneath it
"We ran out of PureVita, and I couldn't lug home a huge bag that day...so I bought a small bag of Wellness Super5 at Whole Foods. My German Shorthair has a sensitive tummy so changing food is never fun. It turns out that she loves this food, and this is the first time she's gone to a new food with no ""transition"" period (i.e., loose stool). We decided to switch, so I checked Amazon, and sure enough there is a subscribe and save option. The pricing is better than PureVita, and the ingredients look decent, and I can get this delivered to my door."
"I ordered the medium, which is actually a medium/large and it is too big for my Scottie. I found after receiving this from Amazon that Petco suggests the small size for dogs the size of beagles, cockers, and shelties. I think Scotties would fit in that category. He doesn't show much interest in the toy even with treats in it. I'll get the small and see if that makes a difference."
After the back and forth from the manufacturer and finally getting a unit that worked I am satisfied with it. Customer service is friendly and knowledgeable. I would recommend this product. It seems to work on my Dachshund.
"Bought this for my new kitten. Wanted a big one to give him space. He has plenty of room to move around, and the carrier is quite light.Would buy again!"
The product was great and got here fast and at a good price..Thanks
"Johnson Pet Doors - We have used this product for about 20 years and have found them to be most helpful since we have 3 dogs and 2 cats. The cats learned to use the door much more quickly than the dogs although they still prefer to be waited on by having us open the sliding glass doors for them! The dogs, on the other hand, go in and out at will and do not require such ""maid"" service. Having a doggie door definitely makes life easier when having multiple pets."
"The Marineland Penguin Power Filter works great! It does have two small waterfalls that come out where the biowheels are located. The sound is a bit loud, but pleasing if you like the sound of running water. After installing the filter and running it for an hour, the tank became crystal clear. It also came with two biowheels and 2 carbon filters. I went out and bought the 400Gph for my larger tank."
We needed this for a wide space to keep 2 dogs in a certain area of the house. Works awesome!
"We have a Lupine leash which we love, and bought this harness when our puppy got big enough for it. We love it - it's stylish, fits well, and goes through the wash and comes out looking like new. It seems to be very comfortable on our dog, and we like that we're not pulling her neck when we take her out. We have one in the butterfly pattern as well, but this sea glass pattern is our absolute favorite. Lupine products are guaranteed for life, and we know people who have sent them back after years of use and had no problems getting a replacement."
"I got the small car seat for my little 8lb chihuahua. It's perfect for her and she has enough room to lay down if she is tired. At first I was torn between the small and the medium but I'm glad I went with the small. My dog loves her car seat, it's much more comfortable and she loves being able to see outside. I like it because it's safe :) Great product, highly recommend."
"My husband and I have searched for over five years, trying to find a toy that will last more than 30 minutes with our dogs. We have three pit bulls, who are all powerful chewers and enjoy chewing as a general past-time and a challenge. They have destroyed $2.00 toys in seconds, and $30.00 toys just as fast. I bought them each a ring one week ago, and every ring is in great shape with minimal wear. They seem to really appreciate this toy. They like to hold one paw in the middle and rotate it around their arm, it's easy to grip and true challenge to chew through. I tie rope to the side and let them play tug of war with them. Another thing I love is there's no mess left behind after a chew session. They are a hit in our household. I recommend these for anyone who has watched a Kong Extreme get torn down to a nub in an hour (and then cleaned up all the little pieces left behind)."
"I have two goldendoodles, 65 and 75 pounds. I put the product on about 24 hours ago and noticed some unusual lethargy, which led me to google side effects for the product. I found a page on Amazon for the side effects, so it's not like the company is trying to hide anything. Still, some people report scary things like inability to walk and worsening siezures. I washed them off (hopefully that makes the side effects better, not worse, even if it makes the product ineffective), and I'm going to look up some of the herbal remedies people suggest.I live in Colorado, where ticks and fleas are not a bad problem - I had purchased this product for going on a trip to Missouri. If you live somewhere like Missouri, the health risks may be worth it for you - but be warned.I don't give one star because for all I know the product ""works"" despite its side effects!"
I received my order of pig ears 2 days ago. My dogs think they are great. All the ears in the box are of a good size and I am really impressed with the quality. I would definately order again.
"my dog loves this bed. it is very sturdy and she loves the pillow around the edge. my dog is about 50 lbs and there is plenty of room for her, so it would be good for a larger dog as well."
"I used to use Tidy cats clay, then switched to Tidy Cats clumping (which I thought was huge improvement) but nothing compares to Scoop Away. I know that a lot of people complain about the perfume but honestly, I prefer that to the smell of cat urine and seemingly, so do my cats! My two cats would NEVER share a box when used Tidy Cats but now, with Scoop Away ([...]) my cats both use the same litter box. The litter masks odors so effectively that my cats continue to use the box even if I skip my twice a day scooping when I'm busy. Yes, it tracks but so do other fine clumping litters but because it smells good, it's not a problem unless you're a perfume-intolerant individual. Overall, I highly recommend this product."
"I believe this herbal eyewash would help with many eye problems, but it didn't completely get rid of my dogs conjunctivitis. It took some medicine from the vet. But it lessend the problem somewhat."
"The quality is fine, however, the pan is impregnated with Microban, which will repel mold and bacteria. Microban is made with a chemical that is considered to be a carcinogen if ingested and all rabbits will chew on the rim of the pan from time to time. I purchased it for my pet rabbit because of the high sides and back, but will not take the chance of him getting sick or worse from ingesting the plastic with this chemical in it, so I could not use it. I did not know it was made with this chemical and that is why I rated the pan with only two stars.I would think that this pan would be fine for cats, as they generally do not chew their litter boxes."
"This was such a fun job putting the system together and the best part was,I could configure it anyway I wanted. I had some dead spots in my aquarium and once even killed all my fish when I moved a rock releasing anaerobic bacterial everywhere. I have a 100 gallon saltwater aquarium and it was a snap to install and when I needed some advice I just called bigfishtanks.com and they helped me achieve a better system than I had originally designed. Good product, great support."
"We have a 12 pound boston terrier who is usually very destructive of toys. My husband brought this home one day and I thought for sure she'd have the squeaker out in minutes and unstuffed within an hour. I was completely mistaken! It took her several weeks of hard playing with it to pull the squeaker out and after a month, she's finally unstuffed it! By far the most durable toy we've gotten for her and I totally recommend it to everyone. She will definitely be getting another one SOON!"
"You can tell that this isn't a high quality manufactured item just by looking at it but I didn't expect it to be. However, for the price this harness works fine. Our 56 pound dog has spine and hip issues and when she has a flare-up we sometimes have to support her mid-section to help her walk. We've used a couple of different homemade devices but the Lift-N-Aid works a little better. It provides a fairly wide area of support, it stays on, and the handles make holding her up easier. I haven't had any problems with the harness sliding up on her like some of the reviews mentioned. Yes it does ride up a little but no more so than what I was using previously. It's a little difficult to get the harness on my dog but that's not the fault of the harness. My dog is squirrelly about harnesses and collars in general. I would't pay more for this product but for $15 it's worth it."
"This potent, endlessly pleasing box of feline ambrosia is the closest thing to opium I could imagine rewarding my cats with, without travelling over to the Middle East to get the real deal. Be warned"
"This is a great toy for any dog owner who has a smart pup, with too much energy! It didn't take him long to figure out how to get his treats (I generally just use his kibble...and sometime feed him his dinner this way when he has too much energy). This is our second one of these toys, the first design with the rope that is actually rope is much better than the previous design where the rope portion was plastic... and he chewed through it."
"I think this is a great pee pad frame! It fits a 17 x 24 pad perfectly. What's nice is that my puppy knows, by just that small step up/on, when she is on the frame going to the bathroom. The clip in edges prevent the pee from seeping on to the floor, saving your floors, which is great. I've been to friends' houses with dogs who don't have a frame and the dog will pee on the edge and the pad will catch half pee, the other half on the floor. This frame will solve that problem and save your floors!"
"This suede coat is great!!! My small dog loves his coat. In fact, when it is cold outside he will wait until I put the coat on him. And, it washes in the washing machine/dryer fine --- at least the ones that I have gotten wash/dry well. I have purchased several over the years and satisfied with all of them. Highly recommend."
"I'm a 30 y/o Aquarium expert, I got 4 of these for my new planted aquarium. As i was looking for a lake/river bottom look for my new tropical aquarium I love the results with these woods. Just put it under water a couple of weeks before using it and do some water changes to help the wood to clean well, otherwise could turn the water a little yellowish. But beautiful woods"
"""you can skip this first part"" I was looking for a filter that used the large bio bags so I can add the media I wanted and can buy the bags bulk for 50cents each. I also wanted a self priming with the pump in the tank and not the filter box. I could not find exactly what I wanted but this was the closest. The new ex series has a different filter media but read where you could make the old filters work with it with some modifications. I choose to try this one. I was kicking myself when I went to walmart and snooping threw the fish stuff I found the ""advance whisper"" filter that was exactly what I was looking for, only $10 more. Had already bought this one, figured I'd at least look at it when it arrived. In the meantime I searched online and the ""advance"" isn't even shown on Tetras website and apparently is only sold by Walmart.THE FILTER"
I was suprised to find this product online and was very excited when I saw it was available. I will gladly refer my friends here to shop.
this deshedding tool works great. my pet's coat feels so smooth and clean after using this. it's so light as well.
