"Angels' Eyes has made a noticeable difference in my little dog's appearance. He's part Jack Russell, part Shih Tzu (we call him a Jack ShihT!) with a fuzzy white face. When I got him, the area around his eyes looked like rust stains on an old porcelain sink, and the fur under hist mouth was also discolored. BY the end of the first month, the stains had receded, and partway into the second bottle, they're gone. It's expensive, but I'll keep using it! Looking forward to being able to cut back to twice a week.",dogs,3
"My cats are in/outdoor cats; therefore, toys don't interest them much (they've had the real thing.) However, they are CRAZY about the Cosmic Country Pillows. When they happen upon one, they flop down and indulge wildly.",cats,2
"Nice quality cat toys,these do not molt or shed, so there is little mess after a long play session. Attractive little toys last fairly long under hard playing,then when they are worn toss them out",cats,2
"Picked this up for our cats and amazingly all four have gone nuts for it. I gave our cat Moe a whiff of the can and and he proceeded to follow me around until I rubbed a small amount on a small soft toy which he then made out with for twenty minutes! Lilly one of our other cats rolled around in bliss with her toy for about ten minutes! :)One little tip for catnip is pinch a little between your fingers and mash it between them a little (like you do with dried spices) it helps release some of the nature oils and scent. Then rub it on a toy and watch the cuteness!Also I seen someone complain about volume of the catnip, I think they may have been using the catnip themselves as my can came filled to the top with catnip. It's a terrific price to volume product as a small vial of catnip costs around $2 at the local store, And unlike that cheap store bought catnip the Sojos looks fresh has a strong smell and drives our cats crazy!",cats,2

"I read many reviews to try to get a feel for what size dog this toy would be appropriate for, and in the end it seemed right for my 25 pound Border Terrier mix. Right out of the package he was wagging his tail in anticipation. I did the typical get him excited thing and then rolled it off for him to go after. He liked it. He began chewing on it. 3 minutes later he had torn several pieces of it off.I took a quick picture before it was destroyed so others can see the size of my dog in relation to the toy and get an accurate assessment of whether it will be right for their dog or not (see submitted photograph).It's a cheap toy, but I expected more than 3 minutes out of the thing. If your dog is a weak chewer, it might just be perfect; if s/he's even a medium chewer, it might not last past breakfast.",dogs,3
"I have a 17 year old cat who with her previous box had been going in head first to use the litter box and not turning around. The result was that urine often ended up on the floor and was a hassle to clean up. With this box, she is able to walk in and easily turn around. I have had no more mess to clean up near the box. I also notice a decrease in the litter on the floor. I would highly recommend this box. This is the best litter box I have ever had.",cats,2

"I have been using this for my Koi for the past 21/2 years. I once brought a more expensive brand and my Koi would not eat it. This past summer, my Koi had more deeper colors with the reds and oranges really coming out. My fish love these sticks and hate the pellets. I would recommend this to anyone. Also feed this tosmall baby Koi that my fish had. They were able to eat this as it gets soft in the water. These fry since last spring when born are now about 5 inches long and healthy.",fish aquatic pets,4

Have ordered this multiple times before. Always arrives in a timely manner and is usually a competitive price. I buy it because it's recommended by the vet so I had nothing to do with the product choice. It's more expensive to buy it from the vet or from nearby pet stores.

"I bought these steps for my Yorkie to get on and off the bed. The steps are well made and they look nicer than the picture. They come with ""anti-skid"" pads, but if you have hardwood floors, the steps will slide all over the place and scare your dog out of using them. My solution was to cut small pieces of velcro and attach them to the bottom instead, and then velcro the steps to the floor. I mean, we can't have sliding steps! It works great and she's gotten used to the stairs now. (And believe it or not, if you have to move it for any reason, the velcro WILL come off of the floor without damaging the wood. You'll just probably have to cut more in order for it to stick again.)",dogs,3
"This super-size soft bed is exactly as described. It is also washable in a commercial washing machine when the time comes to clean it. Our personal protection Doberman, TuPac, took to it immediately. Since his bed is in the foyer and on ceramic tile, we added a heating pad and his own infra-red heater for additional comfort in cold weather. I give this product 5 stars.",dogs,3
"Our dog LOVES this toy. It's the second one we've bought for him, and the only reason we had to replace the first was because of stupid owners (us). Our dog chews through toys quickly, but his ""UFO,"" as we call it, was indestructable until we left it out on a cold winter day and it froze. Otherwise he loves it and we love it. He even sleeps with it tucked between his paws like a teddy bear.",dogs,3
"My first dog loved this toy as soon as I took it out of the box. He isn't an aggressive chewer, so I don't have to worry about the toy being ripped apart. He likes to throw it around and chew on it.** UPDATE ** After 6 months, the paws and ears have been chewed off, but overall still a useable toy. I got a second dog in September, and the two dogs tug on this and love it still.",dogs,3
"I have experienced occasional problems with my cat who sometimes prefers to use the litter box and sometimes does not. Which is not okay, to say the least, in my mostly carpeted home. This product was strongly recommended to me by a co-worker and has to be the best product on the market, hands down, for ridding of stains, odors, etc. All I do is spray, walk on the area (to help the product absorb into the carpeting), and leave. Within a couple of hours (at most), I can't even tell that there was anything to clean up to begin with. I've also sprayed the area where I keep her when there has been odor from her litter box (when she actually uses it). Thus, it works great as an air freshener as well. Even though it seems I can only purchase it online, I will continue to buy this stuff and can't recommend it enough!",cats,2

"It works great, easy to clean and our cats love it. We have 6 cats and it lasts a day and then we change it so they are really happy about fresh water everyday. It keeps the hair out of the pump really well with a little cover that is REALLY nice. We had the largest one thinking with so many cats we would need it but it got dirty faster and they were not happy so we switched and it was the best thing we could have done.I have learned a little trick to cleaning the pump easily Q-Tips. I have found the what I call pond scum that builds up in the pump and is nasty and hard to get out without a major effort (it could be just me) but I have found that if you run it under hot water for a few seconds and then use Q-Tips to clean the scum out it works REALLY well. You can get down around where the magnet sits in the center and all cracks and little spaces. Then I go and run it under the water again to make sure there is no cotton or left over scum and your done and put the pump back together.",cats,2
"At $29.00 Amazon's price is a very good one since I purchased that door today for $37.00 in a large pet store.This cat door was installed on the wall of a screened in porch, since it could not be set on the too thin door.Two persons in good physical condition are a must to install this door. If you are overweight, short of breath, suffer from back pains, arthritis, or have a heart condition, unless the other person does the bulk of the work and you only give advice and moral support, it will be much better for you to to abstain. At various points in the lengthy installing process I had to be completely flat on the ground. When this door is set on solid material (not the contemporary hollow doors) the tricky part is to align the bolts through the holes while holding the various pieces in place. It is far from an easy job. To someone skilled with manual labor, carpentry, mechanics, etc, that door will be much easier to install than to a guy like me!The door itself is very good and works well.There is a magnet set on the lowest part of the flap, it is to prevent drafts from swinging the door open, but since the magnet's power requires initiative and a bit of an effort on the cats' part it may deter some animals from using the door. That magnet can be very easily removed without any damage to the flap and then the weakest cat can swing the door open.Such a door is Not to provide direct entry inside a home but rather inside a screened in porch or a garage, some structure which is safely closed off from living quarters, because as mentioned on the box, once bolted shut it will not stand up to raccoons; they will break down the flap and that was why I had to replace my first door. I now place at night a very heavy block of wood behind the flap. Since I had the original door installed by professionals in my absence, I had no idea how challenging the work would be.Setting up this door was very trying, to say the least, but then it lives up to its promises. My evaluation is based on my perceived value of this door on a two-year period, until that breakage by a raccoon. Now that the job is done, I do not regret having again purchased the same model. Once the trial or ordeal of setting it up is over and all the cussing forgotten, if the job was done correctly, that door will provide excellent service.Still I would hesitate to recommend it to a friend, least he would ask me to help him set up the door!I would advise selecting a simpler model but then, how do you find such an item merely looking at the package? Probably most any door will be as difficult to set up.",cats,2
"I got this after my cat refused to jump over the plastic version in order to get into the room with her litter box. We really needed a gate to keep the new dog out but let the kitty cat in. Works even better than expected. The gate is high quality materials and production and costs less than the plastic version from PetSmart.The added bonus is that my cat loves her ""special"" door - she goes in and out, rubbing her face on the sides, all day long. She likes that it's just her size and dogs can't follow. With that and the new toys I put in the room, she's been using her litter box consistently.",dogs,3

"I had never had a problem with fleas on my dog until I brought home two adorable kittens. I only saw a few fleas at first then within days I was fighting an uphill battle. I had bought flea shampoos, combs, washed and vacuumed everything in site and flea treatments for everyone that were 'on sale'. BIG mistake!!Though their numbers were down, the fleas were winning. I called my mother-in-law and she swore by Frontline. I searched all over and found the best price on Amazon.com. The day it came was a memorable day. It was the day the fleas left. Okay, it took a full 24 hours but I could tell by my animal's behavior that it was working.FRONTLINE ANYTIME!!!",dogs,3
"My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it. Since making the switch my rescue yellow lab has made vast improvements. No matter what she ate before, she was always itching and scratching. Especially at the base of her tail. She used to get so sore at times that she would actually bleed. Her coat and skin now are perfect!!! No more itching, scratching and chewing. All of my dogs are also eating less and maintaining their weight nicely. Less food means less waste in the yard. All in all I couldn't be happier with this food and my dogs will stay on it as long as they continue making it. I also just switched my cat over to their grain free Salmon cat food.",cats,2
Great product. It does not just die the grass green. It prevents the burn that occurs from dog urine. We have been using it regulary for about two years. Be sure to shake it before use. I suggest you clear the line after use by turning the bottle upside down and pumping the sprayer until the line is clear.,dogs,3
"We live in the the city and purchased to take the dogs around when we want to take bikes instead of walking. Went together extremely easy. Can be folded up to store, but takes a few minutes.I have a 85 lb. Golden mix and a 15 lb. yorkie mix. They both love it and fit, though I have to leave the top vent open so my big dog can stick his head out. If they both try to lay down though it would be a tight fit.The only issue we had is the pillow mat that comes with it slips around, we simply used velcro to attach it to the cart so it won't slide and we can remove it to clean also.We are extremly happy with the product.",cats,2
"As much as I have tried, I could not get my Lab to walk nicely on a leash. This product has changed that. It fits great and really keeps the dog in check. I look forward to training her with this leash so that i can walk her with a regular collar.",dogs,3
"This is the first retracable leash I have bought, excellent quality and feel and I find it very easy to use - my 50lb dog feels like she is off leash and no tangled legs anymore. The best thing though, is having a space for the bags on the handle itself. I do not buy the bags that are sold to go in the dispenser, but find that I can fit about 5 bags that are provided by our local municipality as ""mutt mitts"" into the space provided on the leash handle - meaning that I am never caught empty handed . I really love this feature! (so do my nieghbors)",dogs,3
"I was skeptical about buying this scratching post. I have 11 cats and some are pretty hefty weighing 15-20 pounds. Some of them are aggressive scratchers and really put their weight into the process. I thought for sure the post would tip over. I was pleasantly surprised - it is extremely stable. Within a minute of getting the scratching post out of the box and set up, two of my cats were already using it. All eleven cats use it. In fact, I will be purchasing another one of these scratchers soon. Also, I like the fact that it doesn't take up a lot of space and looks attractive in any room.",cats,2

"This product is poor. The fish are colored and the impregnated material does not completely dissolve, leaving colored sandy material on the bottom of the tanks. The water in both bettta tanks became the color of the fish feeder. My fish were still alive after a week, so I'm hoping they didn't fast that entire time. I did, however, bulk them up before I left and fed them immediately after my arrival home.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I really wanted a litter box that didn't LOOK like a litter box. Found this at Amazon and after reading reviews, decided to take the plunge. I'm so glad I did! Now, it IS made out of plastic but I wouldn't call it ""flimsy"" and it doesn't look like plastic. I have had absolutely no problems making the top and bottom pieces fit together. As a matter of fact, it's almost like they are magnetically attracted to each other- that's how easy it's been for me! The cat adores his new box b/c it's HUGE. Way bigger on the inside than his old one (which was a large box) and sometimes I think he goes in there just to fool around and play with the litter. I haven't smelled anything after he's gone in, which is a huge plus. I was most worried about the plant- but that looks great too! And I had very low expectations b/c usually fake plants look, well, fake. But as far as fake plants go, this one looks quite authentic.I highly recommend this item if you are looking for an alternative to the typical, ugly litter box. Good quality, nice design, hides odors and very spacious for the cat.",cats,2

"I am new to being a cat-mom but not so new that I haven't figured out a cat will often/likely behave exactly the *opposite* of how you might expect. I guess my kitty is trying to tick-off the folks at Sojos by feigning complete indifference to their hand-harvested catnip product.I *swear* I heard this cat laughing at me from his litter box when he found out that I bought one organic brand here on Amazon for about $13 a pound, another package at just under $10 for three ounces, and then this tiny little can at what comes to well *over* a HUNDRED dollars a pound! And comes with special instructions to ration it out once or twice a week??? Yup, I'm pretty sure I was hearing mlol, mlol, mlol instead of meow, meow, meow.....Let him laugh - I'm okay with the trial and error thing - with a cat involved I'm actually getting VERY used to it, and being out eight bucks is not exactly going to ruin my day. Just I thought I would mention this lackluster experience with Sojos since this is the *only* brand that I purchased to state unequivocally in their product description that it induces a ""euphoric state"" and no such state was forthcoming. Unless this cat is REALLY good at faking sober.Maybe Sojos should go with a description more like ""your mileage may vary""?",cats,2
"My cats love this product, they go nuts over it. Any toy filled with this gets immediate attention from them. They carry it around. Where it lays on the ground they rub their faces on it until it's sopping wet and then i jump a mile when I accidentally step on it in the dark. If I put a pinch on the carpet they do the same race rubbing thing and then staggar around and act like lunatics for about 30 minutes. Good stuff & good times!",cats,2
"This is the only product that worked for us, our cat is calm and no longer sprays - even when the local tom cat comes around to spray the windows.

"I absolutely love this stroller. We have carriers, body slings, the wheelies(roll luggage type from Target), and strollers. Our 3 Yorkies are our children, and we like to make sure they are with us, and comfortable, and happy. Although the other things do work, they can become inconvenient, but the stroller is fantastic. We have the blue, and the larger pink. Our babies go everywhere with us, including restaurants with outdoor seating. If you are reading this to help decide if you should purchase it, I definitely suggest YES. I have not come across any problems what so ever, except one of my babies is a chewer, and she chewed through the mesh around the zipper, but I just sewed it up with a very thick black thread, and keep my eyes on her. My babies love these too, and if we even go near the strollers, they all come running, and try to jump in them. If I put them by the sofas, they will just get inside them, and lay down. This is a GREAT stroller.",cats,2

"I bought this perch at a local bird store for my cockatiel. This is the second shower perch I have bought, as I have an indian ringneck as well. I like this one much better than the one I bought for my ringneck. The thing I like the best is the lack of a third suction cup. The perch I bought first has a third suction cup on the bottom, and with tile on the walls, it is hard to find a place where the third cup will stick. This one has two suction cups with a bumper on the bottom to brace it against the wall, and it works so much better and is more stable that way! It's great for my birds.

"We have 4 dogs and 2 cats. 2 puppies and 2 four yr old dogs. I notice that each dog had different sensitivity levels to it. The puppies responded really well and learned very quickly. The were not afraid of it and obeyed quickly and then looked to use for a command. We used it to train off and not to eat the chickens. We paired the sound with the No command then after the stopped we gave a new command and a treat for obedience.On my mom's 4 yr old American Bulldog we used it to train him not to bark when separated from the family and not to charge the grandkids and guests when they come in the door. He gets excited and wants to love them but he is massive and knocks people down. He is twice as sensitive to it as the other dogs to the point of almost fearful of it even though he is the alpha dog and very confident. It was a surprise to see him so sensitive to it. So he needed much less training with the device. I hope to use it next to teach him not to kill chickens or cats so he can come to our house to play more often.Our 4yr old Chessie is not quite as sesitive to it and we have to press the button twice, so we are still having to use it to teach him not to go in the pond after dark and to drop it. We have only had the chessie about 6 weeks and he did not learn drop it in before.Bc we have so many dogs, we also worked on these training points with the dogs separated so that all the dogs would not be ""disciplined"" because they all had different behaviors. We also positively reward after they have obeyed. We just use it to interrupt they were previously ignoring us on and then reward good behavior.It works very well on our cats!!! They hate it.;-)",dogs,3
"This home is great for a medium sized hamster that gets lots of hands-on play time. The base is sturdy with an easy to remove and clean bottom. The house is also great and is where my hamster spends most of his time. The wheel is a bit of a pain, however. My hamster knocked it off several times and it also got stuck in place a few times. I would recommend getting a separate metal wheel so your little hamster can run more freely. Because there aren't as many areas for the hamster to run around, this would not be a good home for those who wanted a hamster more for show than for playing with.Overall, I found this to be a very sturdy home (had mine for over two years with not a problem) and my hamster has lived longer than people thought possible.",small animals,5

"We have a 1 year old puppy and were living in a rental home when we got him. We weren't able to put up a regular fence and didn't want to invest in an underground fence knowing that we would soon be buying a home (which we recently did) so we thought this was a great option. I put the unit in my kitchen and made the circle large enough that the puppy had most of the front yard and about half of hte backyard. We were foruntate enough that our neighbors on both sides had fences so I didn't have to worry about the circle extending onto their property since he couldn't get on there anyways.There were definitely some issues with setting up the flags. It would beep at one spot but then beep furthur back at another spot. Someti,es when I would walk the dog around the border, it would beep long before we got to the flag and then not at all at others.My biggest complaint is that there must have been a dead spot off the corner of my garage because the dog would always run away on that side of the house.I did move it to our new house and I have plans on setting it up again now that we have a more open area and hopefully less interference.",dogs,3

"This seemed like a really good idea. It's small and light. I thought it would be good to try for my cat since he isn't used to wearing a collar. However, my problem was that if we kept it on him loose enough that he didn't keep trying to scratch it off, he was able to get his lower teeth under it and get it stuck in his mouth! I didn't want him to choke or hurt his mouth this way so I had to stop using it. Not sure if this is just my cat's stubbornness or a flaw with the product but I am going to have to try something else.",cats,2

"The product arrived with a couple broken pieces, rather dusty and sloppily packaged. The color is much duller than pictured. Also, the picture and description leads you to believe that this is a soft piece, and would flow in the water.... it is NOT. It is a very hard resin material, and some of the edges are actually rather sharp, so if you wanted this for your clownfish... think again you'll end up harming them.... also returning the item is a PAIN. Took 3 days to hear a response and return shipping is the cost of the consumer, even when the item was defective and not as advertised.",fish aquatic pets,4
"We've owned this collar for three years and are buying a second one, so I suppose I've been happy with it. More or less works as advertised, is rugged enough to stand up to our large dog romping around with it, and seems to have plenty of power and range.Only gripe is that the collar itself would be better if it offered a way to remove and replace the rechargeable battery. Seems like the only problem with my older unit is that the battery no longer holds a charge, but the unit itself is sealed and there seems to be no way to replace the battery without destroying the collar. I'll be returning it under warranty to see if it can be repaired, but this would be unnecessary if there was a way to do it myself.Otherwise, quite happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality training collar.",dogs,3

"We have had a serious problem with our cats' marking behavior for several years. They would pretty much pee on anything vertical (walls, furniture, appliances, etc). We had tried several remedies without much success. Last fall, we remodeled our family room and we were determined to keep the new room ""pristine"". We heard about Feliway and decided to give the diffuser a try.Feliway actually worked! We put 1 diffuser in the living room (same old carpet and furniture as before) and 1 in the remodeled family room (all new materials). Marking stopped in both rooms, as well as in areas that are immediately adjacent. In the past 6 months or so that we've used Feliway, we've had 1 episode of a cat peeing on some papers, so the problem isn't 100% cured, but the improvement over daily marking is huge. (We did get a recurrence of some vertical spraying in 1 room when we were late in refilling the diffuser. Refilling it stopped the behavior again).Feliway isn't cheap, but it still costs less than cleaning or replacing damaged furniture, paint and carpets. It's no work --just plug it in-- and the house smells good again. Hallelujah.",cats,2

"This has been a godsend for our elderly cat! Our 18-year-old cat was not making it all the way to the litter box, leaving a puddle on the tray in front of the box every night. In talking with our vet about the problem, she suggested that perhaps arthritis was making it difficult for our cat to jump in and out of the regular rectangular litter box with the flap in the front. So I found this product and thought it was worth a try -- and immediately, on the very first night and ever since, NO more puddles! I almost can't believe that more people (including the makers of this excellent product) have not realized how much easier it is for elderly cats to walk up a gentle slope to do their ""business,"" rather than have to jump in and out of a standard litter box.I saw one review about this product that complained that the circular arrangement made it impossible to clean. Maybe I'm the only one with cats that seem to prefer to use the corners of the rectangular boxes -- talk about impossible to clean easily! With this circular arrangement, there are no corners at all, and the inner surface seems to almost repel the used litter so it doesn't stick to the wall as so often happens with the rectangular litter boxes.This is the first product review that I have ever written, because I am so glad that I no longer have to clean up puddles every single day and that our cat must be more comfortable with this litter box since she has no more accidents and doesn't have to try to jump in and out of the other litter boxes we have used.",cats,2

"This is my first review so please bare with me. I felt compelled to write this review because of all of the positive feedback which ultimately influenced my decision to purchase this kennel. Well, the feedback coupled with the discount price...We have 2 dogs, one which is a bulldog puppy and the other is an adult boston terrier (very small). We wanted to get a second kennel so both dogs would be in a similar size kennel since the adult is already well trained.Much to our dismay, this kennel seemed pale in comparison to our existing kennel which was purchased a year or two ago from a local national pet store for just a few dollars extra.The metal wire on this kennel seemed to be far less thick which meant it was completely unsuitable for the bulldog puppy. It is about the same thickness of a wire hanger which black enamel paint on it.Really, the worst part was the hard plastic liner tray made it unlivable for the smaller dog since it seemed to magnify even the slightest movement on it. For example, we would hear TAP TAP TAP all night long as the boston terrier moved during her sleep. It was so loud that we could hear it throughout our house.Additionally, the liner has a rough texture to it. I assume its to prevent a puppy from sliding around since they do not tend to have rough paws. But with a small mature dog, it was absolutely impossible to listen to the scratching on the surface all day and night.In contrast, our existing kennel had more of a rubbery plastic liner. The fact that it was more pliable meant that it absorbs most of the sound and either dog can move around in it without much noise at all. The rubbery texture also meant that it could be smooth while still providing some grip for the dog.So you are thinking, why not just put a kennel mat inside ?? Well we did, and the noise actually comes from the tray tapping against the bottom metal wire. To solve this problem, we want and purchased a roll of some padded shelf liner. The liner costs approximately $8. So when you add the cost of the liner plus the kennel plus the shipping, we could have gotten a quality kennel locally for the same price. Not to mention the sleep we lost trying to figure out how to solve the problem.Hope this helps.",dogs,3

"This product is a BIG improvement over the Litter Maid self-cleaning litter box that we've had for the past four years. It is MUCH more quiet which we appreciate because we have the litter box in our bedroom and the other one would sometimes wake us up at night when it did a cleaning cycle. I'm also happy that I don't have to empty the waste receptacle on a weekly basis as I did with the Litter Maid box. However, I have noticed that we can't quite make it to 30 days without replacing the crystals cartridge. Perhaps it is because we have an older cat (which is what the Scoop Free literature mentions as a reason) but we only seem to go about 10-14 days before we have to replace the cartridge. This is still a big improvement over our old litter box and the fact that it is so quiet during the cleaning cycle makes it all worth it. I definitely recommend this product!",cats,2

The ""stick"" is made of a very sturdy plastic,and the cloth is attached to the stick with a rubber piece that holds it all together very securely.

"I received this item yesterday, which for one I did not expect (being that it was Saturday). This item was much larger than I expected. I had read reviews before purchasing that this litter box was large enough for a few large cats, but of course, I did not believe that. BUT, it's true. I had origannly thought this litter box would be about the size of a large flower pot so I had planned to place it in my foyer, but that didn't happen. Now it is in my laundry room. My cat (as well as some of the others from the reivews) loved this litter box as well. He jumped in it before I even had it fully put together (much to my relief, because I was concerned with how to transition him into this one). It is also great on controlling odors. I had an automatic litter box that scooped every so often on its own, but I prefer this litter box over that one. That said, I am very pleased with this product and would suggest it to anyone. Also, my cat is a fully grown 18 lb male, and the plant piece is not that bad, you just have to feather it apart as you would a fake christmas tree.

"Good product. I use it for my large Cubes-and-Coroplast guinea pig cage http://is.gd/d3KIS . It is large enough for my big guinea pigs. The medium and small sized fiddlesticks are usable for smaller pigs too but are not as versatile--they are too small for the piggies to fit under. This large fiddlesticks, on the other hand, can be used as a tunnel, a bridge, a hidey, a loft platform (with the sides bent at 90deg instead of rounded as for the tunnel), a space divider (up on its side, bent wavy) or a ramp. Very versatile item, and my piggies enjoy exploring it in various shapes. It is good to change around their cage furniture frequently to keep them exploring. Guinea pigs see in color so this item is visually stimulating for them. I like that it is a natural wood product with non-toxic color.",bunny rabbit central,1

The price was right, so I bought.Shipping was fast, but the quality was poor. The bulbs came in just one carrier envelope, with very little padding. You would think a little more care would go into the packaging of these. Just as you can imagine, one of the bulbs was completely smashed and, thus, unusable.The second bulb was installed, and immediately burnt out (sending a power surge throughout the rest of the circut). This I am not blaming on anyone, but it is apparent that the wiring in the hood was damamged, and not just the bulb itself.

"I have a 115 lb., 11 year old yellow Labrador named Riley. He has developed pretty decent arthritis in the last few years. We had been using the Trader Joe's Chewable Glucosomine and Chondroitin pills for dogs for about a year and they had worked for a while. Then we moved on to these, as my mom had carpal tunnel and tendonitis for a while, and used Conquer to help lubricate her joints and ease her pain. So when we heard of these chewable ones for dogs we bought them. They seemed to be the ""next step up"" from the Trader Joe's ones. They worked for a year as well, where Riley could walk pretty well, seemingly without pain, or much limping. Then we had to upgrade again, to a different variety of these Conquer K9 pills, for older, overweight dogs, that was some kind of super formula that I cannot seem to remember the name of, nor could I find again after we ran out of the first two bottles. This worked amazingly well, allowing Riley to move like his old self. Now we are using these particular Conquer pills, in conjunction with human Glucosomine and Chondroition pills. These two types of pills together seem to really be helping. He isn't his old self; nor does he walk as well as he did when he was on the super Conquer, but he does not seem to be in pain, and limps very rarely. He is 11 years old; one can expect him to move slowly. I would recommend this product to anyone before trying the prescription strength dog arthritis ""helpers"", with all their side-effects. Definitely give this a try!",dogs,3
"We've been using a gentle leader collar on our 6 month old Golden for over a month now. It eliminated his leash pulling immediately, he became comfortable with it in less than a week and we now all love to go out for walks (which means we're out there more often for long walks that benefit everyone). We also have three friends who have been using the collar longer than we have with great success. And our very compassionate vet highly recommends this collar.So, I was shocked to read the reviews about the collar cutting under one dog's eyes, the lead ripping in another case and some supposed dog loving trainer who thinks the collar is like an alpha-wolf grip on the dog's muzzle. Preposterous!! If the collar is properly fitted, it sits LOOSELY in front of the dogs eyes, so how could it cut the dog? If the collar is used properly, there is virtually no pressure on it, so how could the lead ""rip""? And what could be more humane than a collar that creates slight discomfort to correct unwanted behavior rather than the countless frustrated dog owners out there who beat their animals into submission or yank on regular leashes so hard they practically dislocate the dog's neck?I thought Mark Twain's 11/7/05 review was the best. Check it out.For the record, I'm not affiliated in any way with the Gentle Leader folks. I'm just a pet lover who wants to debunk the negative hype about this wonderful product. I wish I HAD invented it.",dogs,3

"I really could not believe how effective and fast this worked. We put it on our dog, and sad to say, it really ""shocked"" her and she jumped a foot in the air. She barked again and yelped!! I felt bad for her. I almost wish I hadn't started using this but I have to say, it works!!! My home is so much quieter and if you have a barking problem like we DID, I would recommend it.",dogs,3
"I have used other ""pockets"" to pill my dogs they were OK but very expensive.SInce I found Flavor-doh it is so much easier on the pocket as well as my dogs love it!!With pilling 3-4 dogs twice a day this is easy, economical and they love it. I have to give small treats of it to the ones that don;t get pills because they all just love.This is a great product. And it will never go to waste because you can always use it as a treat!! I love this product! It's a must have for anyone who has dogs!",dogs,3
I used this product on my dog last month. Since then there's been no sign of fleas (though she's never had fleas before). I found a tick on the dog but it was dead when I found it. I caution people who use this product to pay attention to the instructions. The only drawback is the product's smell. It's not that bad but it's strong and I could smell it on my dog for days. I've used Frontline on my dog before and there was no smell.,dogs,3

"These are the worst crates I have ever owned. I bought 6 of these crates for home and travel (I have shown and owned dogs for 15+years). These crates are flimsy, the tabs ment to hold them together slip- two of these have collapsed with my dogs inside of them. I do love the size of these crates (more of a square than rectangle)but now have just zip tied them together to remain stationary. The clips that hold them together when they are folded bend and warp and get caught on everything. I will never stray again from precision.",dogs,3
"Simple Solution works. Our resident stray got in two years ago and sprayed in the corner by the tv cabinet. Jack has continually pee'd there during two years of building works, the old carpet going down, the cement dug out and relaid and a new carpet going down.... we were desperate. I bought this product for hard floors and sprayed the skirting, the new laminate and drenched the wooden tv cabinet. Once dried, we waited..... problem solved. We put a litter tray by the side of the cabinet just in case but he doesnt even use that now, just gone back to his original tray in another room. BLISS! Great stuff, easy to use - spray and let dry - nice smell and lots of it. will last ages.",cats,2
"I have had the unit for one month and am very pleased with it. Easy to program in spite of what some said. Only problem is that the minimum amount of serving is a hair more than I would like Bandit (my fuzzybutt, purring friend) to have each time. I'm not sure what to do about that, but I have switched to a low fat food which might take care of it. I will be able to go at least one full month on one filling. Ask me in a year of so if I am still happy with it.",cats,2
"Yes, it's way more expensive than it should be. Yes, it tracks some (but no worse than others and less than a lot others). But, boy, does it clump. All cat output (liquid or solid) turns to rock. So it stays way cleaner than any other I've used because scooping the litter doesn't leave behind little bits that fall back into the box when it crumbles. It doesn't crumble. And there is zero smell. It absorbs all of it. OK, I'd like to use the natural litters, like the one made with wheat (what a disaster with smell and crumbling and mess!!), pine (does nothing but give the cat a place to go since it doesn't absorb liquid or odor), the mechanical litter boxes that does the scooping for you, etc etc. I've had cats all my life as far back as I can remember, and have used every kind of litter that's made. This is the best so far.But can you reduce the cost? Or, at least, put it on subscription?",cats,2

"I bought this pan as a replacement for the metal pan in an ancient (17 years) Midwest Model 61 folding crate. The original pan is still in good condition, but I wanted the lighter ABS pan to make the crate easier to carry to training and trials.

"I have a 7 month old springer spaniel puppy, and I've been going through toys at a rapid clip. I bought this because I thought it might keep him occupied awhile and that the toy part would last. He wasn't terribly interested in it at first, but later on he made a project of it. I was encouraged when he stayed working on it for about 30 minutes. He popped the treat out soon after that. I didn't mind so much because I thought he'd just keep chewing on the plastic part - and he did. Unfortunately, it only took another 1/2 hour or so before he had chewed little bits off. I give it poor ratings because a toy named ""everlasting"" should hold up better than that, esp. one so expensive.",dogs,3

"I've tried many types of urine odor remover and I find that Anti Icky Poo works best.I've used 1. Kids 'N' Pets (smells delicious like candy, but doesn't remove odor as well) 2. Urine Off (smells toxic & made me nauseous, doesn't remove odor) 3. Nature's Miracle (no miracle there) 4. Simple solution (sorry, but not a solution to the problem) 5. Out (no odor comes out unfortunately).The trick with Anti Icky Poo is to soak the problem area, cover it with saran wrap, put something heavy on top of it, and leave it there until the carpet dries. Sometimes it takes days to dry the area because it's covered in plastic, but I find this to be an effective tactic. One time I soaked the area and didn't cover it in plastic (because I got lazy) and the carpet felt crusty and hard. Since that incident, I've always covered the treated spots with plastic and the carpet was ok. Also, I don't think you need a carpet injector unless you have padding or a really thick carpet. I just use a spray bottle and put it on ""stream"" so it targets the stinky spots.CONS",cats,2

"I have two dogs, one of which scratches for no apparent reason. No fleas, maybe some type of skin irritation? So I get a monster bottle of this fish oil. The dog that doesn't have a scratching problem just loves this stuff - would drink it out of the bottle if possible. The itchy little dog has no interest in it, but will reluctantly eat food with some oil dripped on it.I have now used up the bottle. The results? I tried, I really, really tried, but I could not tell any difference in the dogs after three months of twice daily servings of this oil. Coats looked no better or worse. Itchy dog is still itchy. Other dog wonders what happened to the tasty stuff.About the only positive thing I can say is since the oil ran out, they no longer have fish breath.",dogs,3
This product is borderline for value but it fits a niche as there aren't any other products (that I could find) out there like it. Its fairly easy to assemble and the quality of the white finish it quite good. I got a puppy and wanted to conceal the litter box and put the food up higher than ground level. It definately did the job. I have a brown tabby male that is about 15lbs so he his pretty big and there are no issues with him jumping up on the top for his food and water. The unit only excepts a medium size litter boxes (check the dimensions) but it still works. I just have to clean the box a little more than usual...vs the extra large litter box I was using. My cat fits inside fine its just harder for him to maneuver a 360 turn.,cats,2
"First,let me preface this by saying THIS IS NOT A CHEW TOY! If your dog is an insane, rapacious chewer he will destroy this chicken. If you can control your dog, or your dog understands that this is a squeaky toy to have fun with, then watch out because they'll go crazy.We got our 3 y/o Dutch Shepherd one of these toys when we were in Canada doing fieldwork (he is a working dog that works with my wife who is a Wildlife Biologist). Our dog went crazy with the squeaking, honking sound and loved his new found chicken friend. At first he chewed a little on it so we taught him not to, and now they last 6 months and are in perfect condition except for the noisemaker inside. We always have to have spares on hand because it has become one of his favorite toys to make noise with. When one dies he gets a brand new one, and he acts the same enthusiastic way as the last one.",dogs,3
"The first Penguin Bio Wheel 350 that I bought for my 55 gallon worked 2 1/2 years flawlessly. Then after changing the water in my tank back in January it died. I tried everything customer service recommended, but it just wouldn't work. I bought another from my local pet store that day. Three months later, after unplugging it to clean my tank, it too died. I could hear the motor, but it just wouldn't run. Yes, I added water to the reservoir before plugging it back in. Again, I called customer service, did everything they suggested and nothing. I needed a filter system fast and called the local store where I bought it and they kindly let me trade it in for another one.That was April. It is now July. I unplugged it for one second this morning and now it won't come back on. I tried cleaning every square inch of the filter, the propeller, the housing, called customer service, and they were no help. The lady was quite rude, actually.I'm now forced to buy a new system today in order to save my fish. I don't have the time to wait to order online. I will not buy from Penguin again, as there is definitely something wrong with this model and their customer service. I kept everything clean and well-maintained. It's a shame, because it is a great filter system when it works.The first unit that did last 2 1/2 years had a different box. Perhaps they changed the model in some way, cheaper parts perhaps, that makes it inferior to the one I bought 3 years ago. Anyhow, I felt compelled to leave this review so this doesn't happen to someone else.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This comb is comfortable to hold, and slides easily through my mini poodle's curly fur (she has a fairy short cut at present). I like that the tines are rounded so not sharp against her skin. She seems to enjoy being combed with it. I just do a little every evening when she's chilled out in my lap. I'm hoping that combing several times a week with it will prevent mats when her fur grows longer. If I used a comb, I'd by one to use on myself.",dogs,3

"I got this sonic trainer to train my 2 puppies to stop eating bad stuff outside. I don't want them eating sticks and pebbles/rocks. It worked at first but they learned that they just have to run out of range. Then it lost all effectiveness outside because they started ignoring it all together. I do live in a noisy area and that probably doesn't help. But I think it is useless outdoors and it works fine inside. I find they react better to my voice than this thing, so for that reason I hardly ever use it.",dogs,3

"I waited several years to buy a LitterMaid since I wasn't sure it could handle five cats. About six months ago, I finally bought the 900 model with the tent. My cats all used it right away and the sweep action is delayed enough that they aren't frightened by it. One even runs in to watch it sweep! With so many cats, I do have to clean the disposable litter tray every other day or so, but I often just empty it and reuse the tray. I tried several brands of clumping litter to see what worked best. They all do the job, but Ever-Fresh with Activated Charcoal is the best. The LitterMaid uses the litter very conservatively so a more expensive brand is affordable.",cats,2
"My vet doesn't carry Advantage any more, so my Neighbor and I tried Frontline. Between us we have five cats. Frontline didn't work at all for our cats.When I asked my vet why they had stopped carrying Advantage, he said because the fleas in the area were developing a tolerance for it. However, we found the opposite to be true. After waiting for three weeks after a dosage of Frontline, we tried Advantage again and it worked immediately and lasted more than 30 days. Any thoughts on this? Has anyone studied flea tolerance trends for these medications in the US?",cats,2

We are still working very hard training our dogs not to bark, but the collars makes this possible. Just one negative. We also used the diffuser with the collars and it made them throw up. But as soon as we unplugged the diffuser this was fine. Just ordered six months worth. It is definitely worth a try.",dogs,3

She did not show any interest in this other than a little intimidation by the swinging arm, even when it was set on the lower speed. I was a little afraid that if she did approach this thing, the yellow arm would bop her or poke an eye, but needless to say it never got that far. She was not intrigued enough to go near it.

"The Gentle Leader didn't work out for us. I love to run with my Doberman, but it wasn't safe for either of us to be running along at a good pace when he suddenly stops, or veers off to the left, or right, to explore a smell or sight that apparently is of greater interest to him than continuing the pace of our run.I've almost landed on top of him when he does a quick stop (not good for either of us), and have almost fallen down when he jerked my arm left or right.Even so, we both loved running.The Gentle Leader totally prevented him from running, so we only used it once.He was 11 when I purchased the Gentle Leader, and we ran practically everyday of his life until last fall, when arthritis and joint problems got the better of him, making it so he can't pull me along for a run anymore.Sometimes he can barely walk around the block without falling down, so, I'm glad we ran as long as he could, and never used the Gentle Leader but that one time.The product definately prevents a dog from pulling, and running, but if you want to run with your dog, but just need to prevent he or she from veering left, right, or coming to a total stop, this product won't do the trick.",dogs,3
need to return. though petsafe makes an outstanding product this particular replacement flap didnot fit the medium size petsafe brand frame purchased one year ago. even copied down serial/modelnumber off original flap to ensure it was the right product. make sure you get a ruler measurement and don't take for granted the embossed numbers on the plastic. inches short. otherwise the actual flap is of great quality and the amozon price is better than local chain pet stores.,cats,2
"I have used a brush similar to this on my cats back home in Australia and could not for the life of me find one anywhere in any country I have visited/lived in since I have left.I now have 2 new kitties living with me and was SO excited to come across it on amazon and at 4.95 how could I resist? My kitties were skeptical at first when this came in but LOVE it now and it collects so much more hair than any other brush I have tried - even the Furminator which is a great product also - my cats just prefer the added bonus of a massage with this type of brush and will sit/roll around and stretch out and enjoy it so it isn't a chore for me and I can get the job done in less time.A friend of mine even commented on my black cat's coat when she came by yesterday, she asked if I had washed him and that he looked beautiful and shiny and all I had done was used this brush on him :)",cats,2
"After owning other training collars, I can say that the Petsafe PDBDT-305 easily tops anything in this price range. It's extremely easy to set up and to use. Simply insert the batteries and go! No paring up like other trainers. Having the correction level on a dial on the remote is a wonderful feature. Another collar I owned had it under the battery cover, and had to be adjusted with a series of switches. But perhaps the best feature of this unit is that it uses standard batteries. No more searching pet stores for specialty batteries that cost $10 each!",dogs,3

"Three months ago, our fifteen year old Maine Coon was failing badly. We were trying to determine when we would have to have her humanely put to sleep. We finally tried Wellness canned cat food as she would not eat other brands except Fancy Feast which isn't that nutritious. She loved the Chicken herring, the chicken lobster, the chicken beef and the chicken. She began eating like a horse and gaining weight. Her coat changed for the better. Her back legs were failing though; so then I researched thanks to Amazon comment boards and put her on Nutramax Cosequin. She is now a completely different cat; and I truly think she could live at least one more year free from pain and crippling.It is wonderful that so many people comment on different products hoping to be helpful to others. This is a great service Amazon has.Bottom line, Wellness is a great brand. Cats love it and it makes changes in their health that I personally never experienced with other products.",cats,2

My Maltese dogs (4 pound Francey and 6 pound Frosty) will do back flips for these at bedtime!Watch out for the smell -- they're REALLY fishy smelling so you need to keep them in an airtight container with the lid closed; otherwise, your room will have a slightly obnoxious odor! Totally worth it as they're made in the USA by KDR Pet Treats in Logansport IN and an amazing value for the quantity you receive. They're not greasy and the crumblies left in the bottom of your treat jar can be sprinkled over food for finicky pups.Hope your furchildren love them as much as mine do!",dogs,3

"I have been buying Air Kong toys for my dogs for over 3 years, and I think it's a good product line. It may or may not be good for your dog, it really just depends on the dog.My son's dog lives with my wife and I (we call him our grand-dog...anyway), he's small & skinny like a Whippet ( but he isn't) and this dog likes to ""kill"" a squeeky toy by removing the squeeker. Once it's ""dead"", he loses interest. On the other hand, my 70 lb long haired German Shepherd will play with his toys until they literally fall apart.Is the Air Kong product line as tough as the original Kong toys? No! They aren't even built the same. They don't last as long, and I doubt that they could, given the design. I think they were designed with fun in mind. An original Kong toy is made for serious chewing. Air Kong toys seem to be mainly designed for playing, chewing, shaking, tossing and chasing, as well as self entertainment/pacification.Some dogs just aren't into the original Kong. Maybe your dog likes squeeker toys. Most of the other squeeker toys I've seen in stores are pretty flimsy and in fact, many of them remind me of toys I've seen marketed to parents of babies and toddlers. Air Kong toys have more heft; but still, nothing lasts forever! My thought is, a happy dog chewing on a toy is less likely to be chewing something they shouldn't.I buy 3 to 4 of the 3 pack medium size squeeker balls a year, as well as a couple of donuts. Worth the money, in my opinion, but again, it depends on your dog.",dogs,3
"When I hear my cats bat around a ball, sometimes the sound can keep people awake.

This a cost effective toy that is also useful for the shelter environment - for cats that get bored in the cages.Cost effective, appealing, and quiet. This is what I expect from the toy makers.

I HAVE to keep these around, it's the only ball I've ever seen her act like this over. She takes it to bed at night, will lay on the floor with this ball hanging out of her mouth for hours on end.

"My dog was on Canidae for almost 2 years and she loved it. She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy. Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic. We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was! It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package. Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!",cats,2

"A friend loaned us the 24-inch crate when we adopted a rescue shih tzu-peke. When we realized how comfortable our new pet was at night, we ordered one just like it. Since it folds flat if not in use it is easily stored. It required some mussle when 1st putting it together but it is very sturdy. The dog even jumped up on top of the crate. She escaped once when we left the door flap zippers at the bottom and she applied enough pressure to unzip a section and squeeze out. We now leave the zippers at the top of the door and that has eliminated her Houdini trick.",dogs,3

"I've been purchasing pumps for my pond for many years until I found this one! It was a hassle to constantly readjust pump settings with every new pump I had purchased as these pumps don't last forever and manufactures don't use the same inlet diameters or tubes. But now the ONLY thing I've had to replace is the impeller which is why pumps end up failing in the first place, and other pumps you cannot replace this part alone. So I've purchased a few spare impellers,and they are very easy and cheaper to replace. I keep the same pump setting and I've only had to replace the impeller once thus far in the 2 years I've had this pump. And I think it was my fault. I could've extended the life of it had I kept the filters clean.I've read some reviews that the prefilter melts, deforms or looses it's shape. Yes, it does! But this does not justify lowering the rating of this pump. Mine lost its shape, but functions just fine. Who cares! It's under water!!The key issue you need to keep in mind is that this pump might be a bit more expensive, BUT you can replace parts!! I've done my math and I can asure you that you end up saving money and time in the long run.If you have had a pond for many years like I have, you know that somehow these pumps break down at the most inconvenient time. Then you can't find the same pump because manufactures change models constantly. Then the pump doesn't fit right, you now need a different diameter tubing, or the GPH somehow is not the same... forget it! Buy this one... and don't forget to always keep an Impeller replacement handy!!",fish aquatic pets,4
"I have 2 cats. One is a few years old and then I have the ""new"" baby of the family. She's 7 months old and likes to turn over water bowls or play in the water with her paw. I did a lot of research before buying the Drinkwell Platinum and it paid off because it was a very good purchase for me and my kitties. It's very easy to set up and get going - - - just make sure you DO read the instruction book which is very helpful and shows pictures of the product, step-by-step. I would say it takes around a gallon of water to completely fill up, including the reservoir. I use store-bought drinking/distilled water rather than our city water. It's very quiet and the stream is adjustable. It's also easy to break down and clean - - - which I recommend doing this once a week or so. I do use the cleaning kit that is also sold on Amazon. The brushes are the perfect size. Another cool feature is that it has a connector between the plug-in and the base, so if you have to plug it in at an outlet that is hard to reach, you can just unplug the connector and take the fountain to the sink to clean.My kitten loves it! She loves drinking from the stream of water and my older cat just drinks from the base. Unless you have one of those cats that's scared of everything, your cat should enjoy it too. I think it encourages cats to drink more, which definitely is a benefit to their health. The clear plastic reservoir on the back allows you to actually realize how much your cat is drinking.I would also like to note that I have also tried another type of drinking fountain that was dome-shaped (another brand). It wasn't nearly as easy to set up and use and clean as the Drinkwell.",cats,2

"Wow! That is my first word of this review and my first thought when it arrived. Huge amount of bedding and such a low cost too! I will try and break it down for the rest of my review below -Packaging and ArrivalThis bedding (8.0 cubic inches) came in a pretty big box and was wrapped with a thick plastic. There was a hole about an inch in diameter, but the bedding did not fall out; however, I will say that since it was in a box, it wouldn't have been a big deal if a little had fallen out. So, A+ for packaging!TextureThe texture of this bedding is very fine, although there were some bigger chunks - no biggie, I just picked them out as they weren't hard to find. There may be sharp pieces, but seriously this is not an issue as most wood-based beddings will have this. Plus, I was able to grab a handful and squeeze without slicing my hand, so yes - nicely shaved.OdorThis bedding has virtually no odor, just a slight wood scent but nothing major. It actually smells nicer than those scented beddings! As far as odor control for the animal, I cannot say this yet since I just received and added it to the hamster tank today - but I will update after the first cleaning!Hamster Approval?My Winter White dwarf hamster went absolutely NUTS when I placed her back inside. She started digging like crazy through every inch of that tank and she immediately started making her sleeping area. The fact that this bedding is wood shavings and not a paper-based bedding does not seem to matter. I do add a little Kaytee Clean and Cozy to the mix though, to give her extra softness for her to sleep in.Overall, this bedding so far has exceeded my expectations! I usually get Carefresh for the main areas of the tank and for $50 or more, you get 1/4 of the amount of bedding compared to this Kaytee Aspen bedding. Just amazing.In conclusion, if you are thinking of getting a safe, wood-based alternative - I would recommend this bedding because it truly is an excellent amount for such a small price!",bunny rabbit central,1

Then, you get a nice polite dog, enjoying the walk!My dogs are so rambunctious, so active and they weigh the same as I do (110!) that I never walked them on the street, only at the park.Now we WALK ANYWHERE, all 3 at the same time, in peace!

I always bring them inside at night and in bad weather anyway and feel this was a waste of money. Better to build your own out of wood with insulation and a shingle roof.",dogs,3

"Although this device has been really effective on curbing our Maltese's barking, I hadn't planned on submitting a review until tonight. Earlier, we headed out for a walk. On the way out the door I decided to take the device along. I can't tell you why I did that but I did. Good thing too. About 10 min. into the walk a larger dog (boxer) came tearing through an open front door that its owner was entering and headed right for us - barking / snarling the whole way. Thankfully I had the device in hand and the presence of mind to point and use it. No kidding the darned thing worked! The boxer stopped DEAD in its tracks about 8' away. It stood there for about a second (it felt like a minute) then bolted back towards the house. I felt a little bad because my poor dog was just staring up at me with a look like ""What the heck?? I'm not barking man!"" Better than being a chew toy I say. So glad I bought it!",dogs,3

"I bought this item to put on the ID collar of my Italian Greyhound just in case it managed to get away. The tube comes with a small rolled up piece of paper with space to place your contact information in case your pet gets loose. Great idea and I think everyone should have one. However, here is why I only give it 3 out of 5 stars. On the one I bought, it seems that the part that screws into the tube, and which holds the rolled up paper, comes unscrewed. I discovered it on the floor of my living room and screwed it back into the tube. The next day I found the bottom again seperated from the tube. This time I tightened it as tight as I could. The next day, gone again. This time I think somewhere in the back yard and I haven't found it again. I don't think that the natural motion of the dog should cause the bottom to keep separating from the tube. I guess I could use a little superglue to keep it together but then I don't think someone finding the dog with the collar would be able to open it then.",cats,2

Being out in the middle of nowhere, I couldn't take him to a vet, but his tail function returned to normal gradually within 2 days and he's fine now.When I returned home, I related what happened to a vet friend of mine and she warned me against using Hartz products because they have an atrocious safety record.Bottom line",dogs,3

So really this shampoo only takes off the step involving rinsing the animal. The smell was ok but nothing to rave about.I will be searching for another product that better suits my expectations and is truly waterless.I will admit that in the instructions on the site it says to wet down the dog, but I saw it after i ordered the shampoo and thus the product shouldnot be labeled waterless.",dogs,3

"God I hate small dogs. Got 2 next door, little chicksh*t bastards that bark at everything, but runs away when I confront them...only to bark at me from 10 feet away. So I bought one of these and it worked, for 1 day. The 1st day I used it, the little demons ran away, the chiwawa actually yelped as if in pain. SWEET! Unfortunately, those little bastards got used to it the next day. This gadget still works, because as they're barking at my wife and I press the button, they will look in my direction but keep barking. So $11.00 for 1 days of peace..not worth it. This gadget should be advertised as a dog trainer for indoor use. To give the impression it'll chase away dogs that is attacking you is just plain irresponsible. It doesn't work on chiwawas, and it also had zero effect on the pitbull next door. I think the problem with this gadget is the speaker is so tiny, it's the size of a dime. Too damn weak. But it did convince me that the concept works. So I'm going to build my own. Check out youtube, build one out of a strong car tweeter, power it up with a amplifier, add a directional tube, and revenge shall be mine.",dogs,3

I use a bed sheet on the bottom and works fine though. I used to put them in their own cage, it is so much easier to put them all in the same pen now. I just say ok, time for a nap throw them all a treat and they are happy as can be :)",dogs,3

"What a great excersize pen, especially for the price. We bought the 30"" tall pen along with the uv resistant top, thinking our 1year old min pin could jump out without the top on. Haven't had to use the top yet, will use if have to take her outside to protect her, but haven't had to use it inside to keep her from jumping out. It's the perfect height. Now she is on the smaller side of min pins only about 5 1/2 lbs, but I have seen her jump baby gates..so this is the perfect height. The quality was better than expected, the only thing that could have been better was the small door..it's a little tricky to get closed..but after you work with it ia few times, not too bad. I originally bought it to use while we were home and couldn't watch her, but ended up using it for overnight use and use while we are gone. Gives her a lot more room than her crate..and she is using her peepad box a lot better now. SUPER FAST SHIPPING...received the same week I ordered it..GREAT!!! VERY IMPRESSED, would definitely recommend!",dogs,3
"I had purchased the Program tablets in conjunction with the Capstar tabs to treat & prevent fleas. I thought I was cleverly saving money b/c the Comfortis tablets that both kill & prevent flea growth thay you buy from the vet are over $100 for 6 month supply, so I was saving over 30% even though I had to buy 2 seperate tablets.The program & capstar together work ok, not great. Noticed a flea on my dog 3 wks into 2nd treatment & did not really help with the itching & scratching. The Comfortis I got from the vet worked INSTANTLY when my dog was infested last summer & when he was taking the Comfortis he did not stratch hardly at all.I would say, suck up the extra cost & buy the Comfortis thru you rvet ESPECIALLY if you nkow your dog has fleas b/c it is an instantaneous flea killer, 30 mins tops, really!But if you are just preventively treating your pet or don' thave a vet to write for the Comfortis prescription, this product would probably work fine.",dogs,3

"My cat loves to drink from the bathtub faucet. She'll follow you into the bathroom and sit with her head at the faucet until you let it drip for her. She recently had back surgery and was confined to a room so she couldn't get to the tub and my wife was worried should wouldn't drink enough out of a bowl, so she ordered one of these. My wife was also worried about wasting water when we let it drip out of the faucet and forget to turn it off.My cat took to the fountain ok and now that she is roaming free again, she seems to prefer it to drinking from a bowl. She still can't jump so she still can't get to the tub faucet. But the problem with this fountain, at least for us, is that after 4 or 5 days, it gets really slimy and it is quite a pain to pull apart and clean all the nooks and crannies to get the sliminess to go away. Between having to dump all the water in it (and it is quite a bit) to clean it, and the water that runs while I clean and rinse it, I'm pretty sure we are actually using much more water with this fountain than we did when we let the bathtub faucet slowly drip for her. I'm also concerned about her drinking the slimy water before I get a chance to clean it.I can't really compare it to other fountains or say how well it will last over the long-term, but my impressions with it for the past 6 weeks are that we will probably go back to dripping water from the bathtub once she can jump into the tub again. The sliminess is a pain and rather unsettling.",cats,2
"We have had quite a few cats come into our yard, with one cat in particular who kept urinating in our garage and spraying on our doors. This device has kept all the neighborhood cats away from our yard. We have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it has done a great job. When I installed the battery, our own 2 cats went running to the other side of the house to get as far away from this thing as possible. I imagine that if you have a large area you are trying to protect that you would need more than one of these devices but this works well for us as we have a small yard.",cats,2

"After using Fresh Step Clumping Cat Litter for almost five years, I decided to investigate other options. I soon learned that this type of litter is bad for my cat, for me, and for the environment.Cats and people develop respiratory problems due to the large amount of dust associated with clay litter. Every time my cat uses the litter box, he's inhaling the dust that's just a few inches from his nose. And the same for me every time I clean it. Not to mention everything in the vicinity is constantly covered with this dust.He has twice developed a blockage in his tear duct that required medication. I wonder now if this was caused by the litter.In addition, cats hate perfumed litters. He's never fussed about it, but it's bothered me to know he probably doesn't like it.The clay litters aren't good for the environment because they don't break down. They just sit in the landfills as more and more is added.After reading about other litter options, I decided to try World's Best Cat Litter (WBCL). I loved it from the moment I poured it into the litter box!First, there was no huge cloud of dust! There was also no perfume smell, just a natural aroma. It's an all-natural litter made from whole kernel corn with no added perfurmes or chemicals.The litter is lightweight and has a soft texture.The clumping is superior. Many times, especially if they were close to the edge or bottom of the litter box, the Fresh Step clumps would break apart during scooping and make a huge mess. This has not happened with WBCL.The odor control is amazing. If you didn't see the cat, you wouldn't know we had one.The litter is biodegradable and can be flushed down the toilet (except in California).I wanted to get rid of the clay litter as soon as possible so I didn't gradually convert to WBCL -- I just washed out the litter box and filled it up. The cat didn't know what to make of the change at first. He had been using Fresh Step almost his entire life. But when he had to go to the bathroom, he didn't hesitate to use it. He seems to be quite happy with it, and so am I!",cats,2

I bought this litter box 3 months ago and had a bit of a hard time with my younger cat acclimating. He finally did - however I had another issue and decided to return it on the 90 day free trial. I sent an e-mail to Scoop Free and I can't say enough good things about the service I received. They answered all e-mails promptly and made it extremely easy to return the item even though I had disposed of the original packaging. Usually under these circumstances I expect a bit of a hassle - NONE whatsoever - they couldn't have been nicer. I like the litter box so much that I went on a forum and found a fix for my problem and decided to keep it. My point is if you have any doubts give it a try - you've got nothing to lose.,cats,2

"i did a lot of research on the different types and makes of dog life vests and am very glad i found this one. for the price and performance, it simply cannot be beat! we have a large 80lb female boxer with a very deep rib cage; she is hard to fit. as far as the measurement guides for selecting the best fit, we opted for the X-Large due to her weight. keep in mind that this is a bouyancy jacket, which is why we went a size up -- to accommodate her weight. we received the item and it is very very well made. i was concerned that it would not be secure enough around her, but there is a giant velcro piece that wraps underneath with very good overlap. and for additional security, 2 non-metal buckles. very well done. the sections that secure around the neck also have velcro, lots of padding, and a non-metal buckle. it might look uncomfortable, BUT once we had it secured properly our boxer did not mind it at all. at no time did our dog attempt to remove it. in fact, she stood still so we could it put in her. this vest is very secure on the dog.once in the water, it did keep her very well afloat! she's never been swimming or near a body of water other than a kiddie pool, and given her weight and inexperience swimming, she'd probably be a sinker. with her life vest on, after only a couple days her experimenting along the shallow end of the pond, she would venture out by herself and swim out among us.when she was swimming, a good portion of the jacket was always visible above water. her chin and neck were in the water, but most of her head and floppy ears were always above water. and she had no difficulty keeping her nose and mouth above water.",dogs,3
"I have the SWEETEST goldendoodle puppy. She is 4 months old and is nearly the perfect dog already. One of the very few challenges I've had is brushing her. She simply would NOT tolerate it. And if I could get her to stop biting for 2 seconds, the slicker brush pulled out all of her adorable curl. I figured I'd give this thing a try considering I'm facing a lifetime of fighting this fight with her. Holy cow. At first she reacted like she did with the regular brushes (i tried 3 kinds) but after a couple of minutes she was laying on her side so that I could Zoom Groom her. Hallelujah! I won't be living life with a matted, scruffy doodle.Many of the reviewers said that the hair goes everywhere. This was not my experience at all. it collected on the Zoom Groom and I just pulled it off. Another good reason to switch from a slicker brush, I don't get stabbed when trying to clean it off.

I found brands I don't like as much, because they are hard to put on (don't clip off in as many places) and you have to put their feet in one at a time, what a crazy hassle that is.

"This pet fountain was okay when I first bought two of them for my cats several years ago, but it did have problems, and they are as follows:1. You absolutely needed to get the reservoir tank in order to have enough water for your cat. The small reservoir alone did not hold enough water.2. I didn't really care for the old-style filters that didn't have the individual compartments like the new ones.3. The filter system seemed to clog up rather easily, compared to the new version.4. It was very difficult to clean. I constantly had a hard time cleaning in the smaller areas, which you had to do by hand because this version wasn't ""dishwasher safe.""5. It always seemed to ""slime-up"" on me even though I cleaned it at least twice per week. Now it didn't slime up every week, but often enough that it seemed like it.Please don't take this review the wrong way, this was a great fountain and I never regret getting two of them for my cats years ago. However, having said that, there is absolutely no reason for you to own one of these now. Drinkwell has come out with a much improved product in theirDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountainand their accompanyingDrinkwell Premium Replacement Filter Cartridges (3-Pack).If you are considering getting this fountain, DON'T! Instead get theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountainit is a much better product and you and your cats will both be equally impressed with it.Shawn Kovacich100% Cat Lover",cats,2

"Wasn't quite sure just what these looked like but I like to provide my goldfish with variety and these looked interesting. HUGE container and great price. They do float at the top of the tank, which is not the best way to feed a goldfish (gulping too much air), but I give these on occasion as a treat. The goldfish do love them and I can actually hear them smacking the top of the water to gobble them up!",fish aquatic pets,4
I have a large golden retriever and she loves this bone. They are my secret weapon when I want her to be chill and interested in something other than running around the house.The compressed bone is MUCH BETTER if you have a large dog who loves to chew.,dogs,3

"I own the neediest cat in existence. She wants to be played with or held CONSTANTLY, and meows non-stop if you are not paying constant attention to her.My cat shows absolutely ZERO interest in any cat toy I have ever purchased for her that does not require human interaction. She will only play with moving objects controlled by a human being. After reading the reviews on this product, I thought id give this one a try to see if I could keep her busy and still be able to get some work done around the house without my little kitty ""helper""While not entirely effective, this toy has come closer than anything else I've tried. She will play with the toy, while I'm in the same room with her, but if I leave the room, she loses interest in the toy and follows me out of the room and starts meowing again. I can turn this thing on in the kitchen while I cook dinner or near my desk while I try to work on the PC tho, and she will watch it quietly and for the MOST part leaves me alone. I had to replace the pom pom it came with with a feather toy before she would bother to actually attack it tho.",cats,2
I have an 80 pound yellow lab. I got the compressed bones so they would last longer than the normal rawhide bones. After giving these to her they lasted about 25 minutes. That is much less time than the normal bone. My dog is a heavy chewer and had broken these into little pieces within minutes. The coating lasted about 3 minutes and the bone itself lasted about 15-20 minutes. Not recommended for heavy chewers.,dogs,3

"These nail clippers are by far the best ones I've purchased, and I've purchased MANY! They do the job effortlessly, however my pug still hates to get his nails trimmed.

"Just a warning, don't let this float. I've lost several fish who became entrapped in this while it was floating.

"Once you quickly figure out the concept, you'll wonder, why didn't I think of that? With a little vibrating finesse, you can clean the cat box in less than half the time of fishing for clumps.

Even the sensitive one had no problem switching to the new model.No regrets, get this great new idea in cat scattery.",cats,2

"I bought the Petmate Deluxe Freshflow a little more than a year ago. I ran it 24/7 without problems until a couple weeks ago. After my usual cleaning, which I do one to three times a month, I reassembled, filled it, plugged it in and flipped the in line switch to turn it on. But, it din't come on. I flipped the switch multiple times and it finally came on. This happened on several occasions until finally I replaced the in line switch. To my dissappointment, and my cat's who patiently waits for her fresh water to resume flowing, it still wouldn't turn on. So I searched the internet for a replacement pump, I wasn't going to replace the whole bowl if I didn't have to. To my delight I found a site [...] that showed step by step illustrated instructions for taking the pump apart to check for clogs in the water intake. I didn't think it was going to work but since I hate to waste anything (money or a perfectly good bowl)I gave it a shot. It was simple....I took the pump apart, removed a wad of cat hair from the intake, put it back together and it's working like new.",cats,2
"The size of the treats is perfect for smaller dogs. It is also the right size for the manufacturing process because it is easier to bake and less likely to break in the package. For larger breeds, just give them a few a time and should not be any problem. All dogs love liver treat. I tried to bake liver cookies myself but it is a lot of trouble. Not only it take a lot of time to mix and bake, the smell of the it is not very pleasing to human. I saw a lot of frowned faces in the house when I was baking it. This is great, not too expensive and goes a good mileage.",dogs,3
"I really like this product, bought the first one at a pet store for my husky and wanted another one for my malinois, but the pet stores no longer carried it. Was able to get this from amazon, glad I was albe to. This is a very sturdy product and is very stable and hard for the dog to drag around unlike what the pet stores had available.",cats,2
"I agree with what the other person said about this tool. However, I was pretty pleased with how it works since my dog sheds, but not as much as a longer haired dog. I did however try it on another dog that sheds more and I had the same problem as the other reviewer had with the hair going everywhere, but it did it's job, but I did have to clean the brush basically after every stroke.",dogs,3
"This is the 2nd time I have tried this product (out of desperation). The first time I tried it with my two pug-mixed dogs it worked the first day (with one) and then not again after. I thought maybe something was wrong with the unit, so I took it back. Got another unit and am trying again now. Same story. The first day one of my dogs seemed to bark a bit less, but after that, both dogs just ignore it. This morning they literally woke us up barking -- it's like it's not even there. Back to the store it goes. Again. I need to find something else. :(",dogs,3

After changing out the pads in my dogs' crates due to water spillage I thought I would give these a try. They set up really easily and have been in use in both of my Corgis crates for a week now. No spills and no tipping as these bowls stay securely in place. Corgis are medium size dogs and I got the 8 oz sixe which is plenty for the short amount of time they are in the crates.,dogs,3
"This heated kitty pad makes a great addition to a winter shelter for outdoor cats. I believe in keeping cats indoors, but if you love cats, you may find yourself dealing with someone else's outdoor cat, or maybe even ferals. I looked at a similar product at PetsMart but it was marked for indoor use only.The heating element of this kitty ""pad"" is inside an air-tight black casing that feels like thick plastic. The cord is 5 1/2 feet long, insulated and covered with a steel coil so that you don't have to worry about a critter chewing through it. The pad is big enough for one cat and luckily, it fit perfectly inside of the small igloo I set up on my back deck. The instructions say do not immerse in water, so the pad shouldn't be used in an open area, though I think it would do ok on a covered deck that stayed dry most of the time...and it makes sense to try to provide shelter against the elements for the cat's sake, anyway, so if you're providing a good, dry shelter for the cat, then the pad should be ok, too.I placed my igloo under a patio table, which I then covered with a waterproof tarp (using patio chairs covered in shower curtain liners as entryways), so the pad isn't exposed to any moisture at all. The kitty has used the igloo and the heating pad many days this winter - well worth the investment.By the way, if you order directly through the manufacturer's catalog, they make the heating pads in semi-circles specially sized to fit igloos...but this small cat pad fit in my igloo just fine.",cats,2
"This toy is not safe for an unsupervised dog! I got my Jack Russell the smaller version (medium) of the one we gave our Rotweiler (large). The Large Black Kong we've had for years but it seemed too big for our Jack Russell to enjoy so we got him the smaller black ""indistructible"" kong. It came with a treat so I stuck it in there. He loved it and then began peeling off pieces of rubber like they were post-it notes. I wonder if I didn't put the food in the hole if he would have ripped it appart like he did (althought I took out the treat myself and gave it to him so he wouldn't eat the toy). I think the smaller Kong is just not as durable as the bigger one and was a waste of 12 dollars for me, with which I could have bought stuffed toys and let them squeak and pull fluff for at least an hour of entertainment.",dogs,3

"I have three himalayan cats, one adult and two kittens. The adult cat had to take a round of antibiotics for 10 days, twice a day. By day three, we were both exhausted. Searching on the net for ways to get her to take pills, I came across these and found them at the local pet store. I couldn't believe how easy she took her medicine in them!! She was meowing for more!! One of the kittens also loved them,( for de-worming medicine), but the other quickly figured out what was going on. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad!!

"Tuf foot is a great product in my opinion. I've been through several bottles of this during training. My method for application is simple and effective. Buy a empty spray bottle and a bottle of isopropyl alcohol (aka rubbing alcohol). I fill the spray bottle with a 5/1 ratio mix of Tuf foot and alcohol. The addition of the alcohol is simply to dilute the Tuf foot mixture to make it last a little longer. The spray bottle method is MUCH better than using cotton swabs, spilling it on your foot, or any other method. The benefits are; you get better coverage with less product, you don't get it on your hands, it's faster, and it gets in-between the toes easier. I suggest using it twice a day, for the first week to two weeks (depending on how tough your feet are already). Once a day is good after that. I apply before bed, and after my post morning workout shower. If you use it twice a day there might be a slight change in skin tone. It's not ugly or permanent. Tuf foot will NOT toughen your feet to leather, only hard miles in your shoes/boots will do that, but it sure helps. Word of caution",dogs,3
"We dont shock our dog much, but we used it for training to break his attention on certain things...like our cats. Level 4 and 2-3 shocked when he would make chase has set things striaght. Level 3 to stop a bark outside, and after a few occasions he got the idea no to bark at everything. We used it with verbal commands, mostly NO, so he knows when we now say NO he better stop whats he's doing. And he does.Batteries only last about 2-3 weeks, even if you arent shocking.",dogs,3
"I ordered the ketchup and mustard hot dog costumes for my Yorkies for Halloween 2010. The mustard costume arrived quickly from EntirelyPets, but was definitely NOT new as advertised. The mustard squiggle was detached from the straps, there were small holes/stuffing visible in the fabric, and the knots on the buns had been pulled. Since it was a costume for my dog and not intended to last long anyway, I fixed what I could and it worked for what I wanted (a couple of pictures and a visit to a local nursing home). Still not happy about receiving a used product, though.It is a pretty simple costume - two velcro straps that attach underneath the dog, buns on each side, and a squiggle down the back. Very cute, but my dog was able to squirm out of it in less than 2 minutes.",dogs,3
"I feed sweet potato treats to my little dog, due to his many food allergies.The sweet potato also provides some fiber to his diet. Lucky for him (& me)that he LOVES sweet potato.

The first rep told me I woul;d have to send it back at my own expense!!! After 8 phone calls, a call to the manufacturer who agreed they sent the wrong thing, Petco still insists they are right.

"When I first took this out of the package, I was super excited and it was the perfect size for my large black lab. But after a while of playing with it, she tore the rope apart.

I thought this was great, but she can only have it at some points and we will take it away from her after a few minutes.",dogs,3
Perfect size for 2 cats. It's made out of sturdy plastic. My only complaint is the filter on top does not keep all the smell in. But I guess it would have to be completely enclosed for that. Completely satisfied.,cats,2
"I am so pleased with the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. Prior to the Platinum, I had the original Drinkwell Pet Fountain which I liked but the platinum pet fountain has so many improvements. To start, it is so much easier to take apart and clean than the original. There truly isn't much need to use the brushes you can buy as accessories since there aren't any small places to need to clean out. It comes apart and goes together very easily. The motor is extremely quiet, much more so than the original - the only sound you hear from the fountain is the sound of the water coming out of the spout. I really like the water storage tank on the back that acts as a reserve. My cat loves it also. I enthusiastically recommend the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain.",cats,2
"THE SHIPPING WAS FAST AND AS ALWAYS, RELIABLE. THE PET TABS WERE RECENT WITH A LONG EXPIRE DATE. THE PRICE WAS AT LEAST 1/3 OFF OTHERS FOR THE SAME PRODUCT.

"If I had to guess, they just bottled up regular bubbles with just enough extract to call it cat nip bubbles and sell it at a higher price. My cat goes absolutely nuts over cat nip sprays but after she smelled these bubbles she just walked away and could care less. The bottle just smells like chemicals if you ask me. If your cat likes bubbles to begin with, they will probably like any bubbles whether there is supposed to be catnip extract in it or not- you should save yourself a few bucks and just get regular bubbles in that case. Definitely not worth the money.",cats,2

The cover screws on and off easily and it seems to seal really well. It feels like it is built of pretty thick plastic and I don't think it will buckle or bend if you stack them. The only thing I wish they would do is add a recessed handle to the top as well as make the side grips a little deeper. It's hard to carry when it is completely filled with food.",dogs,3

"I used an entire bottle of Angel Eyes for my shih-tzu, who had smelly runny eyes for about the last 2 years. I thought the price was ridiculous once I saw the bottles, and the end results were fair, but did not totally eliminate the problem. I started researching more and found out thatApple Cider Vinegar (Organic) 32 fl.ozis a natural remedy for this problem. Well, I've used it successfully for my own allergies and many other ailments, so I decided to try it. After a week of a tablespoon in his water, twice a day, the smelly, runny eyes were clear! And I noticed that his general allergies and itchiness seemed to clear up! I had no idea that something I had used for years would work for my dog!

"I purchased this unit to replace a FreshFlow made by Doskocil, due to the substandard filters presently being produced for that unit. So far, it seems to be doing quite well. I was a bit leary of the way the pump fits into the faountain (from the bottom, through a hole in the body of the bowl), but the O-ring seems to be doing its job and I've not detected any leaks yet. (That said, I'd have been more comfortable with a design where the pump inserted from the top, into a 100% sealed bowl-unit, as with the FreshFlow.)The filters for these units have not been bastardised (yet) as those for the FreshFlows have been; when it comes to my beloved pet I will not tolerate any cost-cutting tomfoolery with the design. The huge reservoir is a plus, as is the deep bowl. Be assured, if the thing starts to leak in future I will update this review accordingly; for now, 4 Stars.",dogs,3

"This kit WORKS! I live downtown in a small city apartment and absolutely could not have stood living with a smelly litter box in such small quarters (not to mention the litter tracked around my apt and the work of cleaning it). Now I get home each day, push the toilet flush handle, and my litter-box cleaning duties are DONE! that easy and no smell - ever.This method DOES take patience on your part. You've got to keep at it, and let your cat go at his own pace. My cat took longer on the last 2 stages to get over than two-weeks (pawing at the last ring rim was a habit for him but he finally stopped because with water there is no smell to cover). But when I finally removed the trainer, he didn't even notice it was gone.My word of advice, each time you introduce a new stage of the training (introducing the kit, or cutting a ring away), your cat might freak, so I would advise putting him in the bathroom with his kitty bed, food and water for a day or two until he adjusts. That way if he has the urge to freak-out on your carpet, he can't get near it. Also, since cats won't mess their bed or eating area, he will have no choice but to coninue using the toilet. And if he DOES make a mistake, don't freak out yourself and give up. DONT GIVE UP. Just be patient and keep at it. It will pay off.And you will be so grateful you followed through to results. You'll brag to strangers about your talented cat. My co-workers can't get over that fact that my cat is toilet trained. They brag for me to new employees and visitors...Signed, A happy, litter-free city girl.Now if someone would come up with a method to stop him from shedding...",cats,2

When we recieved them, I put them on my pups immediatly, and they looked wonderful on! The double locking system had nevery failed us and they don't slip over their heads like some collars do. The only bad thing about this product is that the metal id tag in the middle does come out. But honestly, it doesn't take away from the use of the collar at all.

"We have the old IF-100 we got 6 years ago. We love it. We put it in our walk-out basement and the radio frequency extends well out into our 2 acre yard. If the power goes out in your home, it will shock the dogs, so be sure to put it on a UPS and take the collars off of them when they're inside or sleeping.It beeps first as a warning before they reach the edge, and one shock is all it takes to teach them. We didn't do the little flag training thing and the dogs did fine. We have used this with two shih tzu's and a corgi. I put the shock on my leg and accidentally on my hand and ouch. OUCH!!!!!!! It's quite the shock. I'm sure it works great for big dogs too. I feel sorry for them getting that pain on their neck, but if they aren't stupid and go by the beep, they won't get shocked.When we first got it, the collars seemed to have a lot of problems and we've had several replacement collars back then. No cost to us.Another time, both collars didn't work, we emailed them and they sent us an entire new unit with two collars, just in case it wasn't the collars and was the unit.They've always been very very very good about their warranties and product replacement even when we weren't in warranty! But that was back in the first year and a half.This is now many years later and the second set of collars and entire unit they sent us, haven't had any problems. One of our dogs loves to swim in the pool and pond and her collar no longer shocks, but just beeps. She needs a shock, the other dog it only takes a beep, so we switched their collars. But meanwhile, support says to just reset the unit in the basement. They're supposed to be water proof. So we're going to try that. But I imagine if that doesn't work, they'll be shipping us a new collar because they just are great about that.So the IF-300 must be fantastic compared to our old IF-100.Oh yeah, and our neighbors have one of those electric fences you bury in the ground, and they are constantly having the guys out to fix them. Digging up their yard, fixing them, etc. Messing with their landscaping. We've had no problems like that.In fact, our dogs wont' leave the yard even without the collar, (well right away, it takes them several days to realize they can get beyond their boundaries, they test them accidentally going beyond I think). When we want them to leave the yard on walks, we have to pick them up and carry them over the edge of the yard.",dogs,3

"I had a friend who had a similar toy for her cats. I found this (and a similar one) on Amazon and ordered 2 for my 2 cats. They absolutely LOVED them, but I'm pretty sure they didn't last more than a couple days each. Sometimes, the cats were able to pull so hard that it would come off the door jam, which I didn't mind. But after ~2 days use, they were able to rip the actual toy away from the bungee cord. Perhaps my cats just play too hard?Bottom line",cats,2

"These ears look nothing like the picture. They are small and some of that length is made up of the knobby uncut base and not the ear. Again, the picture shows a cut ear without the base. Worse, they smell...badly. Don't think I can store them in the house and can't handle them without getting the smell in your hands. Seems like the smell is coming from the ear base. I've bought nice, clean, white large ears from another supplier and these are nothing like them.",dogs,3

"This brush is supposed to be less scary for dogs than standard dog brushes.And it is less scary.I tried several brushes including the traditional wire brushes and some (I hoped) happy friendly plastic smaller brushes. My terrier wasn't having any of it. Much treating would get him to stay for a few brushes, but he clearly didn't like the whole process and wasn't coming near without a treat.With the Kong brush, I introduced it first as a toy (briefly - or it would get chewed to nothing pretty quickly). The dog took to it right away. He wasn't threatened by it after a very short introduction.I was really surprised that he actually LIKES this brush. He likes the feel of it. He doesn't flinch and his typical reaction is to roll over so I can brush his belly with it.I can't say much about the hair collecting power of the brush since my dog doesn't hardly sheds. It has collected some dead hairs.Another reviewer recommended this as a bath brush. I will definitely give that a try.If your dog does not like standard brushes TRY THIS ONE.",cats,2

"I love the concept of this ball. Maybe it would work better if you start off using this immediately with a kitten, but with our cats, being old and set in their ways, they wouldn't touch the ball. I am not giving it low stars because of that, I am giving it less stars because it really needs to have an option for even smaller holes than it does. There are two sizes of holes in the ball, one is very large, it could probably be used for dog kibble the holes are so big. The other holes, while smaller, are still so large that tons of food falls out with even the slightest roll of the ball. There was food EVERYWHERE when we tried to show the cats how to work the ball. I guess if your cat is starving, they will eventually clean up all the food on the floor, but until then, you have to hope you don't step in the food and crush bits into your carpeting. I also found it really difficult to open the ball, even after properly unlocking the side. I really thought I was going to break the ball trying to open it. It was also difficult to close up the holes or change the sizes. I suppose this is to prevent the holes from being closed while the ball is rolling around, but there has to be a way for them to fix the difficulty of operation. For our household, where our 8 year old son is responsible for feeding the cats, it would make it really hard for him to open and fill the ball. I could see it also being an issue for older people, too, or for someone with arthritis. Maybe we just got a bad ball...? In short, great concept, but needs a little work on design.",cats,2

"I held off on five stars only because I haven't seen the long-term effect of this. Brought this because I'm so tired of using the water squirt bottles on my newly adopted cat for behavior modification. Soooo pleased to see my cat walk away from the areas I inconspicuously sprayed with the Boundary!

"My pets love this waterer. They like it much better then the more expensive kind with flowing water. This is my second one, for putting in another area.One of my cats loves to sit with his paws around it watching the bubbles; I think he likes the moist environment.Other advantages are large capacity and ease of cleaning. No water pump to unclog and generally make your life miserable. The air pump sits at a distance of several feet; in my case on the counter above the waterer.",cats,2

"My two six month old kittens go nuts every time I bring out this charmer. One of them likes to hide under the bed or in the closet a lot but when she sees me pick this thing up she comes running out of her hiding spot, ready to chase it. It's cloth on a stick for goodness sake, and yet I feel like a master twirler when I make various motions with it, since I can tell that it looks very fascinating to my kittens by the way that they react to it (I'm fascinated with my newly discovered twirling skills too ;)). They LOVE this thing. It's a well-constructed but simple toy and yet it does the trick anytime I want to get their attention and get them running around. They could ignore me for hours, until they see me reach for this charmer. It's holding up very well so far but I'll be ordering a back-up just in case this one ever gets worn out from all their biting and pouncing on it, and especially since I haven't seen one similar enough to this one in the pet stores. Sometimes the simplest (and least expensive) things make all the difference...",cats,2

"I switched to this cat food randomly--Whole Foods was out of the Halo brand cat food I had been buying, and this was the next best option they sold. I'm really glad I switched though! My 2 cats used to vomit up their food once or twice a week, and never liked the Halo brand food. The vomiting is way down now, and they both seem to really like this food. Plus the quality of this cat food is great, which is something I really care about.This 12 lb bag is a great deal. At whole foods, it's $14 for a 3lb bag! With the 12 lb bag, I save $22. Plus with Amazon Prime the shipping was free, so it works out great (even if I paid for shipping though it'd still be saving me money).I really like this food for my cats, and plan to keep using it.",cats,2
"This is my collies favorite toy, she loves to attack the toy full of squirrels and make them fling out. We also play tug of war with it and I use it to cover my arm while we rough house. She also love retrieving the squirrels when I throw them.It is good quality, but like most plush toys, will not last forever and is subject to wear and tearing. I think we are brutal on this toy and it just has a few rips in it, still holds all the squirrels, well all but one as we lost a squirrel due to its squeaker being purged, had to throw it away.I would buy again!",dogs,3
"My cat enjoys drinking from this fountain. I would like it to be more quiet, but it's not too bad. After 5 weeks the fountain started leaking from small cracks in the plastic around the pump.

You have to pull so hard on the leash part I think his eyes were crossing when I tried it. I would pass on this one...",cats,2

"So many types of pads are junk or poorly made. I had experimented around and I was using (and very happy with) the Gridlock puppy pads. I was purchasing the 100 pack. Then I saw these Four Paws Wee Wee pads in the 150 pack for only 3 dollars more, so I decided to give them a try. I honestly can't say they're better than the Gridlock pad, but I can say that they certainly seem to be equal in quality and absorbency.With purchasing of either of these pads on Amazon, the 100 pack of Gridlock pads figure out to about .36 cents per pad, these figure out to .25 cents per pad.I'm very pleased and recommend them.",dogs,3

Easy to program- just don't throw the programming instructions away, as when the batteries die you have to reprogram the feeding times. Batteries do last a long time in this, though.I have an elder kitty who has to be fed wet food several times a day and this bowl is a lifesaver.

"I have an American Staffordshire Terrier(aka pitbull) and she is just over one years old and not many toys are tough enough for her. This toy will slowly get chewed away but after having it a month or so there so is little damage to it that it will last a long time. I learned after having my pup that it is definitely worth the money to buy a tougher toy because in the end you save instead of replacing toy or bone after bone. My dog does not chew on this bone constantly but she gets a craving for it and it will keep her busy for a while. She tends to like things she can destruct, I think they are more fun for her but she does enjoy chewing this bone. I ended up going on nylabones website and signed up for emails and received a nice coupon in my email and I went and bought my pup another different one to go with this one. I know she will be all set for a while!",dogs,3

I highly recommend this product! I'm so happy it went on sale and I got it! I also purchased the medium size, as to give him room to grow and that way I wouldn't have to upgrade, if I had gotten the small size. I also love that it's lightweight and fits just perfect in the front seat of my car (which is a small sedan). No more carrier crate for my dog!",dogs,3

"Alright . . . it's a stainless pet bowl. It was a few dollars less than a better reviewed one, so I went for it. If it's stainless and doesn't leak, what's not to like?Well for one thing, the ""three quart"" bowl doesn't hold three quarts. Right out of the box I noticed it looked small, so I verified first that Amazon sent me the right one. A sticker on the bottom confirmed it was the three quart model. Now perplexed, I got out my measuring bowls and poured two quarts of water into it. It filled to a little less than about one inch below the brim. Even though I knew what would happen, I placed it in the sink and poured in another quart. As expected it overflowed. It WAY overflowed. I couldn't believe it was so much smaller than advertised, so I repeated the process and got the same result. You could perhaps get 2 1/2 quarts in the thing if you filled it to the point where it was about to overflow.As others have said the bowl is most definitely not heavy duty. It's actually fairly thin. I can also confirm that, again as others have reported, the label inside is absurdly difficult to clean off (no, vinegar doesn't work - maybe if you soaked it for longer than I have patience for). Of course, a goo gone type product works, but should you really need to do that?If I had to do it again I'd spend a few dollars more to get something that (a) holds the advertised volume, (b) is more substantial in terms of thickness and weight, and (c) doesn't cause aggravation in trying to remove a silly label.You might want to pass on this one. It earned its one star because it doesn't leak. Unless you actually try to put three quarts in it.",cats,2

I recently purchased two for my home and all of my dogs are fighting over ""bed time"" on these dog beds.

"i bought a gentle leader for my 3 month old GREAT DANE puppy. It does give me better control over her versus a regular nylon collar. I do think you can train a dog not to pull and to pay attention to you and follow you with this halter.You just gotta learn how to. But FIRST you have to fit it on right in order for it to work.In the DVD i received with the head halter it said to make the neck strap tight enough so that only ONE finger can fit underneath it. So i put the the halter on tightly behind her ears, and even then i could STILL fit two of my fingers. So i tightened it more, and more..and STILL i could fit 2 fingers but i figured it was tight enough so i stopped tightening it. Then i took my dog out for a walk and a few minutes into it, her breathing started to be affected by the tightness of the halter around her neck. She was WEEZING and unable to take in a full breathe of air so i immediately removed it and her breathing went back to normal. REMEMBER at this point of tightness i could STILL fit TWO fingers underneath the halter and she is not a small dog, she is a great dane!!! FURTHERMORE! the halter moves from the original place i put it on her neck due to the movements during the walk. THAT is something NOT address AT ALL in the instructional dvd. So, i was constantly repositioning the collar! AND REMEMBER, this was at a level of tightness which inhibited my dogs BREATHING!!I will NEVER put the gentle leader on my dog the way the product makers say to.I DO NOT think it needs to be on SO! tightly in order for the dog to be controlled by it. The next day, i put the halter on her, and this time i put it on her to where it was right behind her ears and able to only slide down less than half an inch from where i originally placed it.I was able to fit TWO fingers underneath the halter, even 3! This worked PERFECTLY, and i was still able to control her very well.The product makers instructions are basically telling owners to squeeze their dogs necks to a chocking point!! and THAT IS WRONG AND UNNECCESSARY. To an inexperienced owner like myself, i ended up chocking my dog!! FURTHERMORE!!, the DVD says your dog would let you know if it was uncomfortable. VERY VERY WRONG!! EXTREMELY WRONG!! i was able to walk my dog down half a block without even a single protest from her due to the uncomfortableness of the collar because i am her pack leader and if i say she is to do something she will do it like i say with true DOG LOYALTY AND TRUST!!With the way I fit it, she was NOT able to take it off, it was SECURE, and the product WORKED just like it was suppose to.Also, just to respond to what a dog trainer on this comments page previous said about being alpha. You admitted when a dog is in an unnatural situation (HUMAN HOMES) dominance behaviors are produced because they are forced to form unnatural packs (with humans and other animals) while living in captivity. So, establishing an alpha position over a dog is very important and undermining that concept to inexperienced dog owners is not right.",dogs,3
"Cutter Plus 5-in-1 Flea & Tick Drops - For Dogs Over 66 PoundsTo start I have been a frontline fan for years but of course I was never a fan of the price. A neighbor of mine just started using this on their dog a little over 3 months ago and obviously I was skeptical. You see we live in a very dog friendly neighborhood BUT many of our neighbors are lazy when it comes to flea prevention and that makes our neighborhood a flea heaven. When it comes to flea and tick protection we need the good stuff to keep the fleas our and our pets in (and happy). We ran out of frontline and are on hard times so taking our dog to the vet and paying for frontline was a bit of a cost we could not handle right now. Our neighbor allowed us to use one of her doses of cutter plus and within 4 days our dog was back to normal and we can check her randomly to find zero fleas (yay!). Not only that but we also have had a bad ear mite problem and for the first time we are not chasing our dog around weekly for her ear cleaning as she really hates it. Her ears look great and we are now are the 4 month of usage. I will never go back.=============================If you like frontline you will simply love this. If you have a flea problem just give this product 4 days minimum to truly kick in. After our first 4 days we were flea free and have been flea free since that day not to mention this is a once every 5 week product vs once every 4 so again you save.Thanks Cutter, this product is great!",dogs,3

"Almost did not order this item because of some of the reviews, but with Amazon's return policy I figured it was a safe bet. I am very glad I did. The cover is a durable fabric and padded so that it is comfortable for my dog. It is intended for a vehicle with rear headrests and bench seat such as an SUV, but I managed to install it securely in my Buick Regal's back seat. There are a number of anchors straps at the top, bottom, and sides so that it can be taylored to just about any vehicle you wish to use it in. And, though this is difficult to explain, it also has straps with heavy plastic tubing (looks like handles) sewn onto the back side where the cover folds that are meant for tucking into the seat to prevent the area at the crease from pulling out.Believe me, if it works for my dog (very high energy Rottweiler mix) it will work for anyone.",dogs,3

"I have four cats, two young ones, a diabetic, and an old one who was always very finicky with his water. This fountain is great for all. My old cat loves the fact that the water is in motion and drinks right from the waterfall. It's very easy to clean, the first time you do it you have to read the directions to make sure you know how it all fits together. You should at least clean it good once a week, be sure to get the hair out that's stuck on the knob and clean with soap. The filters are easy to put in, but they're not really necessary if you keep the water fresh. Overall, it was a great purchase.",cats,2
"I tried, but didnt work out. 4 months into it, we are giving up. I tried training 4 cats at the same time, but obviously some cats are slower than others and I could tell that right away. One of my cats just went on with his business all the time in the right spot. Two of them would totally miss the potty spot by 2 feet or so.. So we would end up with potty gifts in the morning. =(. One of them did well but then decided that the city kitty was only good for doing number 1 and that number 2 could be done in the floor like the other 2 cats. It was really stressful. Now if you have one cat, I definitely recommend it! I'm sure it works because one of my cats was just getting it right away with no problems or anything. If you have more cats like me, I don't know what to say. I tried hard, and it didnt work out. But if anybody out there was able to accomplish teaching all of them at the same time, please comment or rate. I want to know what you did!",cats,2
I am using this product to heat an outside covered pond (145 gallon). There was not enough aquarium space inside for all of my tropical fish this winter. I am using 2 200w heaters and this heater. The temp in the pond is now a stable 69 degrees in winter. The snow even melts from the plastic cover after a few hours! An awesome product.,fish aquatic pets,4
"This item was received quickly and brand new as advertised. It works great! We have a German Shepherd who sheds like CRAZY... It takes out tons of that fluffy undercoat and leaves her looking sleek and well-groomed. And, she loves it! You do have to be careful on the more tender areas such as the belly, and I would recommend doing this outdoors on a breezy day because you will get gobs and gobs of fur. Either that, or keep a large trash can handy. This tool has definitely reduced the amount of dog hair ""tumbleweeds"" in our home.",cats,2
"Great bedding for small animals. Very good odor control, although the lavender scented is a bit better than the plain. Highly recommended.",bunny rabbit central,1

"Says it comes with four small four large to put together two sets of cages and stack them.It only came with one set. I still love the cage.VISION is amazing. I have a snake tank with them as well.Just a bit disapoited because in the picture and directions says its two high, it's not.At least mine wasn't",birds,0
"I bought this collar for my hound dog who loves to howl at everything. We have lots of birds and squirrels or just people walking up and down the street, along with two young children so we needed something to get the howling under control. It has 3 levels you can set it on, we have it at level two at the moment. When our dog has the collar on, she barely makes a peep and when she does, she feels it. It's a little sad but it definitely makes our life easier- and she doesn't wear it all the time. Sometimes if she starts to howl, we will just show her the collar and she will stop!",dogs,3
Sturdy pet gate for my two labs. Well designed to not damage the door frame. Amusing incident was discovering that my smaller British lab (~50lbs) managed to squeeze through the cat gate!,dogs,3
"The lights on this ball lasted maybe an hour and the sound about 5 minutes. It's safe to say, this ball is meant for a chihuahua and not an 8 month old doberman. The picture of a Dalmatian on the packaging is completely misleading. The ball itself is still together and can be tossed, etc, but the circuitry inside is worthless. Even if the circuitry had lasted, there is no way to open it to put in a new battery at all. Don't waste your money on this toy especially if your dog is bigger than a purse dog!",dogs,3
I have 2 cats and this isn't either cats favorite toy. One of them will play with it if I put it in a fun place.,cats,2
"I buy these for Annabelle, my 8 lb Pomeranian, every Christmas. Sometimes I get her the petite, sometimes the regular size. This is the only thing she will chew on so when she's not sleeping, playing with me, or gazing out the window, she's chewing this (we call it ""Blue Chewy""). I was glad to find an alternative to rawhide bones that she enjoys as she had too many close calls choking on rawhides. These last forever for her - perhaps because her teeth are so tiny - but if I leave them around her cousins (shelties), they get chewed to bits in a matter of minutes. For smaller dogs, these are perfect.",dogs,3
"All I want to say is that I am really happy with it, and it not only gives a lot of oxygen to my fish but also it looks nice. The only problem that I had was that the bubbles were only coming from one side and not the other but I have managed to fix it.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This is suppose to be one of there tuffest bones. Our dog had it 5 minutes and she had it broken apart into tiny sharp shards. 24 hours later we had to rush her to the emergency vet only to find out part of this toy was blocking here intestine. Stay away form this toy, or you may have a huge vet bill like we did, $3000 to remove a chunk the size of your pinky.",dogs,3
"I was nervous at first as my rescue kitty was terrified of the new litter box. He wanted no part of it - he was abused and noises scare him. Luckily he watches his brother who had no issues with it at all. I unplugged it during the day and only ran it while I was home. It only took him a week to relax and get used to it. It is now plugged in at all times and both cats have no problems with the litter box. As for myself, it is very easy to clean out and I am so happy I don't have to scoop on a daily basis!!",cats,2
I eagerly awaited the arrival of this car seat because my 9 pound Jack Russell is not very manageable in a car. She will sit in it if I don't fasten her harness to the tether but this defeats the purpose of increased safety. She also has learned how to wriggle out of her Pupia harness. The seat is easy to install and it does provide a good view for a small dog.,dogs,3
"I put this in the corner of my living room by the couch and the end of our upstairs hallway. I was surprised at good it looked. Like the other reviews not cheap looking at all. I had NO PROBLEMS putting the top on the bottom. And I may put some extra branches in it but it looks fine for now. My friends ask me ""Did you get a new plant"" and laugh when I tell them what it is. Watch the price on this one as it fluctuates. You can usually get it for 50% off",cats,2
My dog loves these and they are recommended by her vet. They do seem to lessen the tarter build-up so she doesn't need the teeth cleanings as often.The price here was less then at the vet even including the postage.,dogs,3
"These SportDog collars are great out of the box, and I've had a couple of them, however all of them stop working just over a year. Various issues from receiver, battery, or transmitter problems, all make the system very expensive for only 1 years worth of service. I'll be looking for a different vendor for my next system for better quality.",dogs,3
"The Hooded Litter Pan is always a good idea, and it was resonablely priced. My only issue however, was when I recieved the product, it had looked to be previously used and was broken so that I could not latch and carry the litter pan. :( It was still functional so I decided to keep it, because not having an extra litter box was not an option. All in all, the product is one that I would recommend to cat owners!",cats,2
"I bought the large size for my 15 and 10 pound Maltese/Shih Tzu's. I was a little worried it may be too big for them but they seem to like the big fuzzy toys w/ squeakers the best so after reading all the good reviews I decided to give it a shot.(Without using a ruler I think the hive is about 5"" by 4"" by 4"" and the bees are about 2"" thick around and 3"" long.)Anyway, they LOVE the bees (and they look so cute -and hilarious- in their mouths)!! Overall, I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because it's pretty hard to get the bees out of the hive (even for me) but I think a bigger/stronger (maybe more size appropriate) dog probably could. Mine will work at it some if the bee is already halfway out, but forget about it if it's all the way in there. Anyway, the squeakers are pretty loud (which my dogs love) and overall it's definitely worth the money for me. If you have a pet that just loves soft toys w/ squeakers you could probably just get the replacement bees and they'd be in heaven! I'd give the bees 5 stars for sure.",dogs,3
Since using the Alaskan Bear Salmon oil for dogs we have seen a definite improvement in their coats and health. We highly recommend it for daily use in the dogs food. The Alaskan bear oil is a bargain over other fish oil.,dogs,3
"It doesn't work that well. My dog still barks and doesn't follow my commands. My neighbors still complain about this. I feel like I wasted my money on this. It works just a tad bit. Next time, I'll buy it directly from the pet shop, and I'll bring my dog as a test.",dogs,3
"I purchased this for my 50lb pit bull mix. I mainly use this toy to play fetch. It's great for this activity because it bounces awkwardly and unpredictably, making for a more interesting game of fetch than a traditional tennis ball.However! If your dog likes to chew, they will have the little nubbly legs off this octopus in no time. My dog just chewed them off and made a mess -- the pieces were small and I don't think they'd cause harm had he swallowed them. Other than that, this toy has held up well. It's his favorite toy, but like all toys, he's never unsupervised with it, so I haven't given him the opportunity to rip it apart. I don't doubt his ability to, either.Pros",dogs,3
"for a big dog, having the leash clip on in the front would be fine, but for my little terrier it means the leash's metal clip bangs around his chest and leg area. Get a harness like the Sporn, that clips on top. If you did buy this one though, put part of the leash you are meant to hold, through the harness's medal ring so that it's reversed and the metal clip is at the end you hold. I did that for a while, now I am just going to get a new harness, though because this harness is also kind of awkward to put on and off.",dogs,3
Within 3 minutes my female puppy had this poorly made toy in pieces. I purchase many toys for my dogs and this one was without a doubt one of the worst. This is a latex toy that is easily chewed to pieces and is a choking hazard to the dog. I couldn't figure out how to give it less than a one star rating (which it deserves).,cats,2
"This sturdy crate is good protection from other animals and large size openings with a bottom pan.. easy slide out for cleaning. But the pet's feet are on the pan... would prefer a wired floor. my bunny needs a deeper 6"" pan I bought separately and put the whole thing in it.",dogs,3
"My dog LOVES these. She loves to chew on things and this is the first toy that she has not destroyed within the first week. We have had the ball that these treats insert into for over 2 months and it still is like new. The chicken flavor appears to be her favorite so far. They will last several days if we don't take the toy away, longer if we limit her exposure or rotate toys. She will lick and lick and chew and chew for hours. Inserting the treats is a bit difficult but not too bad. We have not had any problems with her removing the treat as others have described, my guess is that they are not getting the treat set into the ball correctly. This chew toy is a keeper!",dogs,3
Great fit for wide staircases.Use it all the time......keeps the little ones safe.Nice to have a permanent gate that doesn't buckle when shook back and forth by toddler.Need to make sure both top and bottom latch in.Took just two practices to get the hang of it.,dogs,3
"Before I bought this car seat for my chihuahua, it was difficult taking her in the car with me, unless I had someone in the passenger seat willing to hold on to her. Even then - she was constantly wanting to move from the passenger side to my lap. She couldn't see out the windows & wasn't stable as I braked or turned. But now, I slip her harness on her & attach it to the strap that comes with this seat & she's in doggy heaven. Quiet as she can be. Just stares out the window & watches the world go by. I feel so much more comfortable knowing she's safely secured to the seat belt in the event I need to stop quickly or turn. Also, the liner comes out & is machine washable, haven't had to do that yet, but s nice feature nonetheless. Well worth the money. Works just as we'll in the backseat as the front. A harness is a must with this seat, but that's true with any dog car seat.",dogs,3
"I had the cat genie for 2 weeks. It was easy to set up. It worked for a total of 4 days and then the motor blew up. I had to wait 5 days for it to be replaced. It then worked for another 6 washings before breaking again. I returned the unit at my own expense ($33 shipping) and the cat genie company kept $66 of my money. Shipping doesn't cost that much. Do not waste your time or money. $100 lost for 10 uses. Back to scooping, yet glad nonetheless to be rid of the thing. By the way, the unit I bought is the newly improved version. Or so they say.",cats,2
"I ordered these particuler seatcovers because they claimed that they were waterproof. I had just purchased a new subaru outback. I frequently take my 4 small dogs with me; one of which is still only 9 months old & still a rambuncious teenager! He can get into things & I wanted to be prepared for any spills, etc. To make a long story short, he tipped over my almost finished latte onto me & the drivers seat. I immediately pulled over & cleaned up the mess(about 1/4 cup total)! It blotted right up, but when I checked under the seatcover, it had leaked through in that short amount of time. The covers appear to be made of a strong material & they were easy to install, BUT they are not waterproof!!!",dogs,3

"I've been using this very same model of aquarium filter for 25 years. I'm glad that it's still available on the market after all of these years. I've looked at Tetra's newer EX line, and I wasn't impressed. These old Whisper filters do the job, do it well, and last forever when they're taken care of properly. In all the time I've been using these units, the only changes I've seen to the design is that the box is now made from a sturdier, less brittle plastic and they've added a foam cartridge for a bit of biological filtration.This is a fantastic product, the best of all of the ""hang-on-the-back"" aquarium filters in my opinion.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I've been looking for a product that my dog could be in back (on my leather seats) and I could have some protection that didn't cause her to slide from side to side every time I took a turn. This fits the bill pretty well. The front is a nylon-type fabric with cross-stitching. The back is a light foam rubber layer, and when there is weight on it (IE a dog) it does not slide easily against the leather. There are two elastic straps at the top which can hook around the headrest (or if you have split-seats that fold down, the seats themselves) and hooks at the bottom that you can attach to the seat bottom.It's worth mentioning that the entire fabric is in two connected pieces. There is a slit down the center, presumably to allow for using a seatbelt through the fabric. Personally I would rather it be a seemless fabric, but I can see this being useful.For the price, I recommend this product.",dogs,3

I give him a few pieces on the floor, put the rest in the ball and roll it away- which gives his 'sister' time to eat her treats unmolested. I don't make the holes too small however because he'll give up too quickly. The little dude wants results without too much effort or he'll abandon it.",cats,2
"My 10 week old learned out to sit, rollover, shake, and open a beer in 20 minutes with these. Kidding on that part but he actually was attentive to his owner knowing that he would get this treat. Definitely well for training, especially being all natural and only 2 cals each! We have the lamb jerky as well, that he may enjoy even more (if possible) however it's not a treat for training due to the size and texture but I recommend those as well. We start obedience class next week so hopefully they don't lost their magic :)",dogs,3
"This purchase was a great kit for my freshwater tank. It contains everything you need to monitor a new tank that is being cycled and run. The only things it does not include in the tank is the gh and kh, which not everyone should need for there tank but is helpful thing to have depending on the fish you contain.The only thing that is not amazing about this tank is the nitrate test. It requires you to shake one of the solutions for thirty seconds, and after putting in the second solution, you need to shake the test tube solution for one minute and wait five minutes to have an accurate measurement.Pros:-comes in a nice convenient box to store all of the chemicals and test tubes-contains the minimum test kits you are going to need to cycle and run a freshwater tank-is not expensive-most of the test are fastCon:-the nitrate test takes a little bit to test, but if you have patience it is not a problem-filling up the test tubes take a try or two sometimes, but if you get a pipette, it is no problem at allEnjoy this product! It is very useful.",fish aquatic pets,4

Just going through and noticed I never reviewed this product. It works great and has worked for three years now. I have an outside dog that refuses to come inside even when its cold. I have a hard time getting her to even go into a dog house ever since she was fixed at the vet and had to stay overnight. This under a thin bottomed dog bed keeps her warm on all but the coldest nights.

"Da Bird is the best cat toy you can buy! It actually mimicks a bird's movements and looks and sounds very realistic. It gets my cats leaping and jumping all over the place! The key is how the feathers are attached to the rod--it allows the feathers to spin. Definitely make sure to store this where your cats can't find it when you're done playing, otherwise it will get destroyed.

Even the cat gets in on the action with them.But the ""critters"" aren't standing up to the mighty Labrador - already they are coming apart from us leaving the toy available 24/7. Better to make this a playtime toy that gets put away than to leave it out all the time.

"I've bought every brand of odor remover out there. You name it, I tried it. When I found Kids-n-Pets, my pet-owning life got much easier. I use it to clean up all manner of pet accidents. It works on pees, poos, vomit, hair balls. It also works on all surfaces from carpet, my hard wood floors, kitchen tile, I've used it on the seats of my car and it is excellent in the laundry.I bought one of those black lights you can use to find the urine stains on your carpet. I treat the stain with this product, let it do it's thing for a day or so, then I black light it again to verify the stain is gone and it is. I also give it the sniff test. Odor gone. It's amazing. Especially with pet urine, you need all traces of the odor eliminated or your pet, having marked that spot, may return and repeat. Especially with carpet where liquid stains can sink through to the padding below, be sure to pour enough of the product on the stain so it can do its job. For laundry, pour the product directly on the stain then let it soak and sit for a while. Those enzymes need time to eat away at the odor before you wash.",cats,2

"This is one of those simple, but effective products. It does exactly what you want it to do - keep the dog (cat, or whatever) water from freezing, not require a lot of maintenance to use, and not cost a fortune. This hits a homerun in all three categories. I accidently clicked the &#34;quantity&#34; box when ordering this, and ended up with two instead of one dish. So one got re-purposed to be a water warmer for my chickens. The one i *intentionally* ordered keeps water drinkable for an outdoor cat. Both have been perfectly effective down to -4 degrees the last couple of nights. And as far as I can tell so far, the dial on our electric meter is not spinning out of control, so though the electicity to run these is not free, it looks like they are reasonably effecient.",dogs,3
"I have an Australian Shepherd and I use the Furminator regularly. Nevertheless I don't get THAT much undercoat out when I rake him with it, and he still loses lots of hair all over my house.

"When I opened the box everything was in perfect condition and the cage was much bigger then I had imagined, which is awesome! It is the perfect size for my 2 rats, they have lots of room to run around and climb!The only thing I would say to be careful for, is if you have rats under probably 6 weeks old, they might be able to squeeze through the bars. I was a little concerned at first when I put my 3 month old in, but he can't get through them!Great product, I'm a very satisfied customer :D",bunny rabbit central,1
"This product contains the active ingredient used to fight tapeworm and fluke infestations in humans, first developed by Bayer in the 1970's. I'm pleased that I can buy the same product that formerly required a trip to the vet and vet prices (and all without the cat-hatred and grudge-holding that accompanied the injection). Dosage is easy, and even if you lose the packaging, it's all over the internet, never mind that a cat can take five times the usual dose without ill effect, and only three tablets come per bottle.",dogs,3

"We installed two of these in our new house and outbuilding in 1996. Last year (early 2010) one had it's flap broken by a big dog that wasn't supposed to use it. I was very pleased to find the exact model so we wouldn't have to re-work the opening. I have just purchsed my second replacement one in order to change out the other pet door. While it isn't broken, it has become discolored over the years. Also, for some inexplicable reason, the magnet has become very strong and only our experienced cat can open it. Our younger cat quickly learned how to use the new pet door that had replaced the broken one, but she just can't grasp that the other one will open if she head butts it (can't blame her.) These doors are installed in the exterior wall of an unheated garage and in the exterior wall of an insulated garden shed. They keep out snow, but driving rain has made it's way through the hairline opening between the flap and frame.",dogs,3
"I've been using Da Bird to play with my cats for over a year now and they still love it... but the feathers can break or get chewed up (if you aren't quick to rescue it from your cat after they catch it!) and so you have to regularly replace them. The problem is, these 3-refill sets have softer, smaller feathers that can be almost useless after a couple of play sessions. My cats prefer them to the sturdier, brightly-colored feathers that are sold individually, but they just don't last long! I've resorted to gluing feathers back on after the cats snap them off to get a bit more wear out of them.",cats,2

"I was unable to find a smaller pill gun in stores, so I resorted to checking online. When I looked at this online, it seemed smaller and thought it would work perfect for the 1/2 pill I need to give my cat bid. It turned out to be bigger than what I thought and I have to position the pill just right or it falls out of the tip. I have managed to make it work and has been much easier to give my cat her pill without getting my fingers bit! I can see this was made for a whole pill, not 1/2 pill.",dogs,3
"Well made product - 4 stars for that. 2 stars just to emphasize what some other reviewers have said - that hard plastic may not work for your cat, and you may have to return it as we did. The fleece cover is very thin and provides no cushioning. As many cat owners would do, am trying just about anything that has even a remote chance of working. Was hoping it would work for a heat-seeking indoor arthritic animal. Instead, she chose any soft surface nearby, even if it was in a cooler part of the room. The box actually suggests using it for arthritis; however, I would think that the chances of a cat using it would go down greatly if they had arthritis. So far what has worked the best is heating wire for seeds underneath a towel on top of a pillow.....and 24 hour on call petting, food, and pain meds. After all we're talking about a cat....",cats,2
We purchased 2 collars. Both dogs responded well to it after the first time we put it on them. We don't keep it on them all the time as it does tend to go off when the get excited and playing around. One of our dogs all we have to do is show her the collar and she stops barking.,dogs,3

"We have a VERY barky rat terrier. He goes absolutely bonkers for any squirrel or dove/ bird in the yard or in the trees around the yard. He will literally bark for like an hour incessantly if we let him. We got these collars at PetSmart and they are super effective until they BREAK. And they definitely break. We have been thru 2 in 3 years. They stopped working after about 6 months and we have just been using wishful thinking that they will start working again after much tinkering and battery changing. Also, the other reviewers who mention battery usage are right. These collars EAT batteries up and they are a total rip off since they make them so that you have to buy their brand. We had hoped that just having the collar on would be a deterrent, but our little guy is smart and figured out that he can bark to his heart's content when the battery is dead and also learned how to drain it. Since it has six progressive levels, he would sit and bark four times and let it reset then bark four more and let it reset... you get the idea. If you have a smart dog don't buy this collar. We are moving on to something else.",dogs,3

"Other reviews are correct, this product does not work. We purchased this for our 10 week Multipoo in hopes our situation would be different and the product would help. It didn't. The collar had no affect on our puppy at all. He would still bark with it on and the beeping noise it made bothered us more than him. It is true that the collar would go off at times he wasn't even wearing it and it was just sitting on top of the counter. Not worth buying.",dogs,3
"I got this based on all the great reviews and I am very glad i did! I have two cats one of which is 15 years old and they both took to it immediatly. Before I was using sifting bags to make cleaning the box easier but it was still a hassle to do, this you just roll and dump and it literally takes less than ten seconds to do. I was worried about stuff getting stuck in the grate like sometimes happens with the kind that has a mechanical rake but so far no problems. I did find out you have to roll it slowly or you get alot of ""clean"" litter in the tray and roll it back in the opposite direction so the sifted litter goes back in the main compartment. It also has high sides, both my cats are males so this helps with any spraying, i know that sounds gross but this is a review about a litter box!",cats,2

"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",cats,2

My Charlie (a Cavalier King Charles) loves these toys. He has several different ones and the bone is his favorite. He is an avid chewer and always has something in his mouth. He has ripped apart tennis balls and Nylabones and so many other things but he doesn't rip apart his bone. He did ruin one of the earth shaped balls but the bone is in one piece. I got him the medium size and he can't get his mouth all the way around the end part but can easily carry it around by holding the middle. He chews on the ends and maybe the reason he hasn't been able to ruin this toy is because he can't get his mouth all the way around it. Whatever the reason is that this is the only toy that has lasted more than three months I'm glad I bought it. Charlie uses it at least four times more than his other chew toys yet it has lasted three times longer already and is still in one piece. I'm getting another one that is smaller for my new 8 week old terrier and we'll see how that goes.,dogs,3

Now she rides pretty happily in this car seat, even though she constantly looks at me for reassurance. It's stable enough now, but then she only weighs 3 lbs. Don't know yet how it will be when she's heavier, and also I CANNOT see a 20-lb. dog fitting in this little basket! You'd need a shoe horn.

The connections on the receiver come loose from the collar often and we almost lost the whole thing once. We made it a habit of tightening the connections every time we take the collar off and put it on. Also, the whole collar is now fraying terribly where the holes are that we aren't using. We now have to find a new collar since ours will not last much longer. The collar is just too cheaply made. Otherwise, the whole system works great and we are pleased.",dogs,3
buut maybe too great of a toothpaste! My dog (mini yorkiepoo) thinks its a treat and tries to lick it off as soon as its on his teeth so I have to brush relatively quickly. Maybe thats the only drawback. He's much more fond of this toothpaste than the last probably because its not so minty. I like how there's a big and a small toothbrush. The small tooth brush makes it a lot easier to brush the back teeth.,dogs,3

"When I purchased this I was specifically shopping for a ""dangly toy on stick"" that I could drag around for my cat, who loves to ""hunt"" anything long and stringy. Sometimes after ""catching"" the toy, he will carry it off in his mouth to his ""lair"" (inside of a closet). It's hysterical to see him dragging it around like it's real prey.What I like most about this toy:1. The ""stick"" is short relative to the ""dangly"" part, which means the cat has more to play with. On other ""dangly toy on stick"" toys, the part available to the cat to actually play with is quite short relative to the stick.2. The toy appears very well made (in America no less!) and the dangly part seems very securely fastened to the stick. I have heard of other such toys where the cat was able to pull off the toy part from the stick.3. The dangly part is not just a string/piece of ribbon attached to a stick. The fabric is folded over so it is 2 sided and is tapered to a ""point"" at the end. The kind and cut of fabric means that when you move it from side to side, the dangly part moves sort of like a snake. A plain old piece of string or ribbon doesn't do that.As someone else stated this toy does require supervision. The company has indicated as much on the tag that comes attached to the toy, clearly stating that cats should NOT be allowed to chew on it. In fact, no cat should ever, ever be left alone with any kind of string-shaped toy.We always put this toy away in a place well out of my cat's reach when he has finished playing with it.",cats,2
"I have a little Chihuahua that jumps off the bed at night. The bed is too high from the ground and she can not jump back up. She is a little princess and will whine and cry until someone wakes up and brings her back in the bed. These stairs were the solution to our problem!!It took some training, but we got her to use them. The stairs are great for medium to small sized dogs.

"My dog eats his own poop. Twice now, he has barfed up literally a half to a full gallon of vomit (dog is over 90 lbs) filled with the *piles* of crap he'd eaten from outside that had time to rot in his stomach for a few hours. Before you say, maybe we should clean our back yard more often... we do. The dog can poop mountains in one event, and then will turn around and eat his crap. I have seen him do it. Diarrhea doesn't phase him. I have worked at a vet clinic for years, have worked in the human hospital environment as well - so I have cleaned *tons* of some of the worst poop, puke, blood, guts, etc - both human and animal - and I have NEVER smelled something so awful and vile as this. The first time he threw it up, I was livid. The second time, I knew I had to take drastic measures to prevent this (the vet told us to put meat tendorizer in his food. what a joke), or he wouldn't survive his 3rd event. Now I have the muzzle and it will go on every time he goes outside.This product has a warning on it to not leave your dog unsupervised while he's wearing it... but the way I see it, without the muzzle, he will have a 100% chance of, at some point, eating his crap and throwing it up again in the house. That means he will have a 100% chance of being strangled if we don't use the muzzle. So anything less than that suits me fine.I do think if my dog was more motivated, he could get this off, but so far he hasn't. When I first put it on, he half heartedly tried to get it off and then just drooped his head and looked up at me like, ""why? why would you do this?"" He's tolerated it since. He's kind of a slug though, so if you have a really determined, high energy dog, they might be able to destroy this pretty quickly. I kind of wish the strap that goes around his ears was more like the strap on the cloth muzzles they use at the vet. It would be easier to put it on quickly, and I think you could get it on tighter. Plus it'd probably be more comfortable for the dog.I do really like the front grill. It's the reason why I picked this muzzle. I am *positive* that at some point he will try ramming the muzzle into a pile of poop and I think the grill will help ensure he doesn't get a mouthful. If he manages to drill it in there far enough and get poop, I plan on taping some cardboard over the front grill only. If that works, I'll probably switch it to some type of plastic so I can just hose it off. At any rate, I don't think he'll be able to eat as much poop anymore, and hopefully it will eliminate it altogether.UPDATESo my prediction was right. I changed it to 3 stars because they really need to make this better for poop eaters if it's designed specifically for problems with chewing and not aggression. For the first time, I left him alone with the muzzle on outside for only a few minutes. I needed a break from him after I came home to a mess he made from ripping open packets of taco seasoning and spreading it all over his bed. So I went to check on him outside and the front part of the muzzle was clogged with crap, and the muzzle was hanging off on the side of his face, so he probably got some poop. I can only hope that he was distracted enough trying to get the muzzle off that he didn't get much poop.***I did alter the muzzle. On another occassion, I had left the muzzle out when we left, and he chewed JUST the portion off that contains the holes (he is smart enough to do this, but still eats his own crap... I don't know....). So I used a headband and that actually kept it on his face tighter than the strap. However, I think the stretchiness of the band allowed him to get it off. I am purchasing a replacement muzzle, and may get another brand as well. In the mean time, I'm going to try to find another way to make sure it doesn't come off... after I hose of the muzzle.....",dogs,3

"I bought the Kyjen squirrels in a log toy for my dog, and he absolutely loves taking the squirrels and any other toy I put in there out. I thought he would like these ""egg babies"" also, but he doesn't really take the balls out of this one. It is an okay toy, and I'm sure lots of dogs love it, but mine isn't too into it. He does play with the squeaky balls by themselves and I hide them in his other toys so it isn't wasted money. He knows how to remove the eggs, he just doesn't really do it. He prefers having a bigger opening, I guess. (He also has the bees in the hive toy and loves that one, too)",dogs,3
"I use filthy animal on all my poms. It is great! Takes the smell off the boys with bad aim. It has gotten out who knows what they found in the yard every the time.

"I bought this for our one cat thinking it would make the kitty box maintenance and bit easier and, cut down on the smell some. After about two months, it just stopped working. I called the company and they made me contact Amazon.com first to try and get a replacement. They wouldn't replace it, so I had to send the battery cover and power cord back to the company before they would send me a new one. After about two months of using the new one, it stopped working too. Don't bother with this.",cats,2
"When I first received this collar, it worked alright. I was neither impressed nor unimpressed. However, after a week, it stopped working at all, and I figured that the batteries in the collar had gone bad, so I took it to my local battery store and had two more batteries installed at a cost of $8. Three days later, the same thing happened. I was upset that the batteries I purchased were bad. They re-replaced the batteries for free and put in a pair of ""premium"" brand batteries. Well, three days later, they died. After eating a bit of crow and offering to pay for the batteries they put in for free, I replaced them again at a cost of $12. This time, the collar died within two days, and the collar was only used once during this time. I took it back, put another set of batteries in it, and brought it home. Less than a day later, it happened again. After dealing with the collar over the past several weeks, I decided to take it off, and it's been sitting on our washing machine ever since. I could not get any customer support from PetSafe, and a local store employee told me this system had a problem with the on-off switch. Needless to say, I cannot recommend this product to anyone, and I feel that I put my money down the toilet on this one!",dogs,3
"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.",dogs,3
I really like this pet barrier. Our dog learned to stay away from the front door in the first week. Now she doesn't even have to wear the collar. She is now trained to stay away. I like the different settings. We used the lowest settings and it only zinged her when she was right at the door. We placed the main part right next to the door on the wall at her level. I think this is a great product for the money. I felt like I was being cruel to her the first time it zapped her but after the first time she didn't freak out like the initial zap.,dogs,3

"I don't believe that the Scat Mat is inhumane at all. We set it on low and touched it ourselves, and barely felt a thing. Medium is only slightly more noticeable. It's just enough of a ""surprise"" when the cat steps on it to get their attention. It doesn't actually hurt a bit. It does keep them off of the kitchen counters (where they could potentially get badly hurt) or from running out the front door (where they could get killed). Having unsuccessfully tried every other trick in the book, these mats turned out to be the perfect solution.The only down side is if they can see the mat, you have to leave it in place forever or they will know when it's gone and it's safe to jump up on the counter again. :) So hide it as best you can so they can't tell whether it's there until they hit it.I do have to say, they are a bit overpriced!!",dogs,3
"I set the pen up before the puppy got here to see how easy it would be to set up and take down. Just remember to lock the bottom locks if you want to keep it up. I noticed that it had an inner liner and can be wiped down in your puppy makes a mess and the padding can be washed in a washing machine, You can also put a puppy bed in the pen and food and water. This is not made for a puppy to stay in all day. Only when you want to keep the puppy from under foot or you have company. Other wise use it for the puppie's protection so no one steps on the puppy. I found it to be a great new product on the market. It is made for more of Toy breed puppies.",dogs,3
"We have two dogs, both 11 months old. I have been using this for a few months now. This seems to irritate their skin and while one seems to hide it since he is completely scared of getting the application, my other dog (a black lab mix) goes crazy after getting this applied on her skin. She runs around and rolls on the ground, trying to get rid of the application. It really doesn't help when she pretty much rubs most of it off. However, I haven't seen any fleas or ticks on them. Still, the initial application seems to be extremely irritating and I had not seen this with Frontline. She then proceeds to ignore me for the whole day for doing this to her. And they still both scratch... a lot.I was hoping they'd get used to this but it seems like it's just too harsh for my dogs.",dogs,3
"A very healthy treat for the dog while training.

"I'm not sure what happened, but this thing stopped working after a couple of weeks. We rarely used it, but one day it just stopped working.

We aren't the kind that will manually brush our dog's teeth so every bit helps.With so many treats in the box we are glad they divide them into two resealable bags.. so they aren't likely to get hard and stale.Our local pet stores don't carry this large size so we're glad to find it at Amazon!",dogs,3

"I put them on a five month old kitten. It was traumatic for him until he stopped fighting me. He has tried to take them off. He was successful with a couple because the glue hadn't dried all the way. I gave him milk while they dried the second time. So far, he's had them on for an hour & has given up a little on taking them off. They are still on for now. It was definitely a 2 person job. I recommend these, but it's not easy at first. The instructions say it gets better with training. If I had help applying, there may have less upsetting for the kitty. I am currently cover in the super glue & fur, Kitty still stand-offish about coming to me.",cats,2

"My dog loves this ball. If you have a dog that pops every ball that comes in sight, or chews every toy he owns in a day, then this is the ball for you. It is a very hard plastic. I would compare the hard plastic to a bowling ball, but about as heavy as a basket ball. I still give it 5 stars because my pit mix plays with it all by himself and rolls it around like a soccer ball all over the yard. Don't kick it, lol... it hurts your foot. And don't throw it, cuz it would probably pop ur dog in the face. I got this ball almost a week ago, and there is only a couple scratches on it from my dog trying to pick it up with his mouth. Eventually he stopped trying to bite into it and started rolling it around like a true soccer player. It is the size of a soccer ball, by the way. I was also excited when I realized that the ball was blue instead of red. Hope this helps!",dogs,3
"This is probably one of the best inventions for playing fetch, especially with larger dogs that love to run. It's really easy to learn how to use and works great for throwing the ball much farther than I could ever throw it by hand. The plastic grip is durable and has survived my dogs chewing. And the ball is durable.",dogs,3

"Amazon!! Please allow users zero or negative ratings on products!!___________________________________________________________________________Never!! Please, never ever use this product!We have two beautiful healthy young dogs (4-5 yrs), with a pristine health record (until hartz of course). They get premium food - Timberwolf Organics, Acana, Origen, Blue (I mention this because poor diet is often associated with illness in your pawsy companions).We had new neighbors with dogs move in a few weeks ago and my little one had started itching a bit. I was going to order frontline from petmeds and instead picked this up in a split second decision while walking out from Wallys. My logic being, ""hey if it doesn't work, I can still order the Frontline"". Plus it was priced at only $5.99On Saturday evening, I showered the girls and applied this on my itchy one. The next day my dog started showing signs of minor epileptic shocks - yelping in her sleep...yes I do know about dog dreaming, but these dreams, if they were that, were, with shock, pain and disorientation. Since it was Sunday, our regular vet was unavailable. We had no idea how serious this was about to become! That night, convinced that she was having a series of bad dreams we made sure she slept close to us on the bed. The episodes continued that whole night, a couple of hours apart.Next morning I noticed some swelling on her snout and one of her eyes. There was also a red spot on her belly. By that time we had read other peoples reviews on this product and were shocked that this poison is still put out for unsuspecting consumers!! Alarmed we called the local emergency care and described her symptoms. They urge us to rush her there. By the time we reached the hospital, my baby had gone into an anaphylactic shock. She had petechiae all over her abdomen and she was swollen all over!She was hospitalized after she was stabilized with steroids, antihistamine and antibioticts. Our woes did not end there though. I can go into more details, but I feel it suffices to tell you all that after about four thousand dollars and a homeopathic detox program, we were finally able to get her close to normal. After about a month and a half today, she still takes some herbs and supplements to support and balance her messed up immune system.Just ONE tube of the three doses!!The amount of anguish and death related to this product far outweighs the justification of dogs who might be 'flea free'. In the course of that week we must have met atleast half a dozen vets who just shook their heads when I mentioned the Hartz product!! It has killed hundreds of cats apparently and is more fatal to their littler bodies (my dogs are about 65lbs each).Please do not, do not buy this poison!!",dogs,3

At first it worked great but the July 4th holiday pushed him over the edge!

It is nice and deep and she doesn't spill her litter on the floor anymore when she hops around her cage. It has been easy to clean and maintain. This cage opens from the top and side which I really like. She is easier to catch from the top. It is also easier to scoop out soiled litter from the top than the side. Very happy!

"I love this litter, even though I don't love the price. It has its drawbacks, like any other litter- it tracks, it will smell if your cat doesn't cover their feces, and it's pricey. But- I keep coming back for two reasons. #1- it's the healthiest litter on the market. Most people know that clay litters often contain asbestos and are carcinogenic to both humans and felines, and this is nothing more than ground corn. Nothing to worry about there! And those silicone beads just kept giving my cats HORRIBLE infections in their feet...I have no idea why. #2-The smell! I can't stand scented litters, they make me want to gag when I'm cleaning out the litter box, and while the newspaper and pine litters are nice, they don't cover the smell AT ALL, so your house always ends up smelling like cat pee. I've tried them all, and for a little extra money (this stuff actually lasts a long time- if you can get over the sticker shock it's worth it!) this litter is hands down the best there is.",cats,2

Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...Only problem was... soft stools... Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food. The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels. This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size. They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves...",cats,2

And I mean, CLEAN. It's so nice not having those loop-mats hoarding nasty litter. I could use the regular vacuum cleaner on it, but I decided it was too much of a pain in the butt to get the thing out, move my litterbox house thing (Merry Pet Products-Cat Washroom And Night Stand from Amazon), and vacuum the small area. Just pulling the hand vac out and spot cleaning is much simpler.",cats,2

"If you are in the beginning stage of training a dog to return and are worried about his/her wandering off into traffic, this is a pefect way to protect your pet while teaching it to fetch, come, etc. If your dog fails to return when you give it a &#34;fetch&#34; command (whatever word you choose for that), you have the assurance that you can &#34;reel him or her in&#34; while repeating the command over and over until the pet learns the command. If you have a particularly independent dog, you may want to try other training techniques to prevent wandering, but this is the least intrusive, pet friendly method I could think of, and it has produced some success. The only downside of this lead is that it can tangle up if you don't watch how you roll it up and allow your pet to extend the lead. Still, it is a good value for training purposes.",dogs,3

"Priming after cleaning or power outage just takes too long, if you get it primed at all. All the advise is useless. It's a bad design. You can hear the impeller cavitate - it's trying to pump, but it takes a cup and patience to fill and refill the thing until IT finally decides to pump some water. And if you have it pumping, it's barely enough to get the wheel going. Did I mention that it eats cartridges - one a week is not uncommon at all since the floss is too fine. It cost a fortune to operate this thing and then the time it takes to clean the impeller that clogs to easily. When I first got it I thought, well people just don't know how to operate and maintain a tank, but let me tell you",fish aquatic pets,4

"I bought this harness for my mini poodle. He's pretty laid back, but I didn't want him to be unsecured in the car in case I had to hit the brakes fast. I also worried about him jumping out the window. I bought a size small for him. He is 15.4 lbs, 13 inches long on his back and 20 inches around in the chest area. The harness easily fit him, in fact it would fit a larger dog with ease I think. I like that the front has the flat, padded section to provide support to his torso in case of braking fast. A regular harness wouldn't do that. What I didn't like it that it is very difficult to attach to a seatbelt that has a shoulder and lap belt combo, like my back seat does. I tried tying a leash to the headrest and clipping him to that, but he had too much freedom and could jump into the back cargo area. Finally I jammed a leash down in the bottom corner of the seat and tied it with about 6 or 8 inches of leash sticking out, and clipped him to that. That worked, and he seemed pleased enough with it. I just think that for $20 (what I paid at Petsmart) you shouldn't have to jury rig the device to make it work correctly.PS I looked through the other reviews and people said it was difficult to put this harness on... I had no trouble at all with it. As I said my poodle is pretty calm, I guess if he hopped around a lot it would be tougher to put a harness on him. But I think a very active dog would probably be better in a carrier anyway for safety reasons. I also think you could attach the harness to the seatbelt, even a lap and shoulder belt, if you purchased a large carabiner hook and used that around the belt and on the loop. People also said their dog chewed through the harness. I agree that probably would happen, it isn't the heaviest weight. Kong makes a similar harness product that is heavier duty, it is about twice as expensive as this one.",dogs,3

"The minute this bed was out of the box and assembled (assembly takes less than 2 mins.) my dog was up on it and curled around. He instictively knew what it was for. The raised bed is just right for him. I tried those petbeds that are soft and can be pushed around and they never worked for him. Mostly he would just try to drag them around and chew the stuffing out of them. This bed is outstanding and well worth the money. One thought though, does it come in a slightly larger size? My pup is a bichon/TshZu mix and is a little bigger than he should be. A slightly larger bed would give him more room.",cats,2

My one year old Lab. loved the bottle filled with his kibble. The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them. You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food. The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces. The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure. Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it.,dogs,3

"We had this collar for one of our dogs in the past but the pet stores seem to have stopped carrying them. I was so happy to find it on Amazon! I needed one for both of my dogs. They are large dogs, and when we need to grab them quickly, like if someone comes to the door, it is so handy!! All you have to do is reach down and grab the handle (aka the leash) and you have an instant hold on the dog-perfect!! Not a choking collar, not running to grab a leash, just a temporary easy hold on your pet to keep her by your side. If you are going for a walk you still need to attach an actual leash, though, this isn't meant for long-term use, just a temporary fix. With our large puppies nothing else is the same and we love them!",dogs,3
&#34;I really wasn't sure if this collar would work because I had tried other bark control products. My dog has lots of curly thick hair around her neck and the collar kept flipping on her...but apparently it somehow still sprayed her with the citronella. She used to bark just to bark. Within one day of putting on the collar she has completely STOPPED!!! This was well worth the money. IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS!!!!!&#34;,dogs,3

"I used this net to clean scum from a 20x20 foot drainage pond. The first thing I noticed was that if you extend the handle it bends and would easily break. So I shortened the handle all the way, and was very careful not to put too much pressure on it. After about 30 minutes of skimming algae from the pond, I noticed a 2x2 inch hole in the net. Apparently a stick or some sharp object had punctured it. Now I have to buy something else more durable.",fish aquatic pets,4
I wanted to try this box out because I have 2 cats that are very picky about the litter box. I was cleaning it daily and the smell was strong. I could not afford the electronic scooping box so this looked like my best bet. it is very large and even with the grate inside it is still big enough to accomodate my cats. The rolling action of the box is easy and traps all of the clumps without touching a scooper. After rolling the clumps into the pull out scoop it is very easy to deposit them into a toilet or trash can. I love this product and would recommend it for anyone that hates to clean the catbox and can not afford the expensive electric ones.,cats,2
"I purchased this crate for a ferret. I like the fact that it is made of sturdy plastic, which is great because my ferret enjoys ripping apart the fabric ones ( which is dangerous because he can escape). It locks securely and has a convenient over the shoulder strap. The tiny compartment at the top is big enough for a small Ziploc bag of food. The food/water dish is sturdy, but I wish there were 2 included. The only downfall is that terribly ill fitting plastic part at the top. I never found out how to put it correctly. Even when it seemed to fit, something was off.There was too much space left (which is dangerous, again because he can escape) ,so i ended up taping it up on an emergency vet visit. It has remained unattractively taped up. I am currently looking for another travel crate. Save yourself the headache.",dogs,3

"This product is not really a dog bed or what my dogs would call ""cozy"" It would be best used as a crate pad for short-term crating or as a bed only for dogs under 30lbs. Heavier dogs need more depth to their bed. For dogs over 30lbs if this bed were used on top of carpeting that has carpet padding below, that would be adequate for most dogs up to 90lbs, but still isn't ideal. Used on a wood/tile floor this bed does now allow your pet's hip/shoulder joints to sink in.I have purchases dozend of pet beds for my rescue over the years. I can't for the life of me, figure out why this one is so pricy. One night we had both dogs in the same room and only one bed available. We took out an old comforter and folded it 4 ways. Our 60lb and 70lb dogs competed for the folded comforter and ignored the ""cozy comforter"" unless it was the only option (and that was on a carpeted floor). The best beds for large dogs will have at least a thin layer of firm foam and/or a thick layer of soft foam. A layer of Poly-fill above the foam allows for them to snuggle in and nest while that layer of foam keeps bones from pushing through to a too-firm surface (your floor). Poly-fill alone tends to shift leaving spots that don't provide enough cushion. I haven't yet found a bed that is perfect for large dogs but is under $75, so I just make my own. You can do this too. Just buy a low-cost or high-end a poly-fill dog bed that has the poly-fill in a liner. Remove a little of the stuffing (save for later if the bed goes flat over time). Cut to size and insert 1-3 layers (1 layer for dogs up to 50lbs, 2 layers for dogs up to 100, 3 layers for giant dogs) of Target 2"" mattress-pad foam into the outer liner and then insert the liner with poly-fill. The pad here is 4"" so it is adequate for large dogs but over-kill for those under 50lbs.EggCrate Foam Mattress Pad - Thickness 4 inches",dogs,3

"I love it! I bought this a month ago. My domestic shorthair had sometimes peed on the carpet immediately outside of the laundry area of my apartment, where the cat box resides. I plugged this gizmo in - and I also thoroughly treated the peed on spots, after locating them with a black light. She has not peed on the carpet since then.Not only that. My Siamese has not thrown a major hissy fit since I got the diffuser. If you have a Siamese, then you know what a Siamese hissy fit is like, I'll bet. He is much calmer. He asks politely when he wants to go out on the patio. He doesn't have crying jags in the evening, when he wants me to go to bed and pet him. He sits calmly and stares at me instead. Amazing - truly amazing.I see this doesn't work for everyone, based on the reviews, but it sure as heck works for my cats. They are happier. I am happier. Win win all the way.One suggestion - I highly recommend locating the spots with a black light and then treating them with a solution that will neutralize the pee and remove the smell completely. This, I think, will increase your likelihood of success.I just bought two refills.",cats,2

"I purchased this bed in black, sz xlg, for my 14 mo/old Eng. Bulldog, 70lbs, and 10 yr/old lab, 60 lbs, to share. With a useful load of 150lbs it easily supports one/both of them with no issues. The legs and cross members are sturdy with the bolts connecting the frame tightly forming a ridgid yet comfortable sleeping platform. As an Air Force officer, my family and I move regularly and enjoy traveling frequently. The ease in which the bed disassembles/reassembles makes it perfect for those seeking solid and secure yet comfortable bedding for their pets. The only negative issue is the cushion could use a bit more padding. My dogs however did not seem to mind and one can easily rectify this problem with towels, a pillow, etc. This is the second Durabed we have owned, the first one was 2yrs/old( replaced due to our moving company losing it on our most recent move) and this one is currently 3 mos/old. Purchase this bed with confidence but be sure to shop around as I just purchased ours for $48 new, tax included. Lastly, I found that using ""Scotchgaurd"" or a similar product helps to keep the fabric's color brighter over time and eases cleaning. I put mine in the washer on handwash/delicate fairly often just to keep it fresh with no ill effects.",dogs,3
"The litter is hard clumping and I like it for that. But I agree that the perfumed litter is horrid, nasty stuff.

The Love Glove has worked wonderfully to remove the fur from her undercoat, and the cat seems to enjoy being brushed. The only downside I've found is the glove doesn't always grab all the fur it loosens so I do end up with clumps of it on my clothes or the floor. My cat is short-haired so I imagine that is part of the problem. A sticky lint roller is an easy solution, and it pulls the fur off the glove without creating dust. Overall, I'm glad I bought it!",dogs,3

"Seller promised to send me the missing assembly instructions via e-mail. It was never received and no follow-up was given to see if I received it. An extra piece of wood was included to which I do not see where it possibly could go; also, dowels were included which had no holes predrilled in the unit for their use. The unit is put together with unfinished (unpainted and unstained)wood. Seller said this was so buyer could color it the way they wished. Once I figured out the assembly it went together okay, minus the extra parts. The continuous bag included with the unit that draws out of the rectangular box works okay but the retainer assembly is not an exact fit. I suggest using an appropriately sized garbage can without the lid. Use suitable garbage bags instead, and you'll save money in the end.I would only use this unit with the Littermaid Mega as the newer model with the steel combs does not pick up well at all and should be avoided as most waste is left in the litter box for you to clean it out manually! The newer model Littermaid is very badly designed in this area and is less sturdy and more cheaply constructed in my opinion.A word to the wise",cats,2
The head collar took about a weeks worth of walks to get use to by my 70 lb lab/pit/X. He had decent walking skills already but this helps me control him when he sees a squirrel.

Perfect container for my cats as they had figured out how to open my last container. Keeps food smelling fresher as well. Overall Happy with purchase,cats,2
"I purchased small for a 9 pound chih/minpin mix. It's a tad big, but the small might be a tad small so I will keep what I have . He loves to lay in AZ/Valley sun ALL summer long, so AZ's winters are quite detasteful for him. We have a pet bed warmer for him, but this will help on his daily walk when the temps hit's 35 or under. It's very well made and looks as nice as the photo shows. It has a slit for the leash to hook up with the dogs collar/harness. I don't dress my dogs up, so this item was purchased for warmth.",dogs,3
"Not certain if this really works. At times it does seem to work properly and then other times it does not. Might depend on pitch of bark, etc. Still on the fence about this product",dogs,3
"For my beagle, this leash length works well for letting her explore during walks, but it isn't so long that I can't maintain good control. I considered a 15 foot leash, but am glad I went with the 10 foot length. The construction is solid. I have been using this leash daily for over a month now with no complaint. It gets dragged on the ground and through brambles, and hasn't shown any signs of wear yet. I expect to get over a year of twice daily use out of it. If you have a dog that doesn't have to explore EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE, the leash will last a long time.",dogs,3
"Works great on my yorkies tangles in his hair. Only reason I gave a four instead of a five is that it doesn't smell so nice, but definately gets the job done!",dogs,3
"I have had this water bowl for 2 years and it works great. However the bottle easily breaks but it was too small anyways. I swapped out the 1 gallon bottle with one of those 5 gallon ""Arrowhead"" bottles and it is perfect for my thirsty 100+lbs Kangal. Though it utilizes an anti-microbial plastic it is still not algae proof. So if you use it outdoors, make sure you change it often.Pros:-strong enough for 5-gallon bottle swap-bleach safe (easily cleaned with a 10% bleach soak)-2+ years outdoors with no UV damage-MicrobanCons:-original bottle is easily cracked",cats,2
This is not made of super strong material so if your dog chews everything this is not the toy for your dog. IF your dog is a problem-solver this is perfect! I have a super smart aussie and she loves this thing. the bad thing is that the treats come out pretty EZ if u use dog kibble. If you put a milkbone it would get stuck inside. I am very happy with this product.,dogs,3

"Simple, sturdy construction. Loud enough to get your pups attention in distracting situations. Pair it with Pat Miller's - Power of positive dog training book and you'll have no problems teaching all the basic commands.",dogs,3
highly recommended due to absorbency and is easy to fit with the velcro. also the price is almost half of the same product at PetCo. it also washes well. i soak it in a bucket with Nature's Miracle. i love that i can tell when the dog has piddled. he used to be able to hide it for a while until i found it in the carpet. now it's evident because of darkened fabric where the piddle settles. this product has helped us immensely and now my dog is almost completely poddy trained.,dogs,3
"I like this stuff, but I don't love it. It works well, but I just don't like the smell. I've used many ear cleanser solutions. I've never found one that smells good. Except some tea tree oil stuff that didn't work so well. It's purely subjective. You may think it's fine. I like other brands better like Vet Solutions or Epiotic. I also wasn't pleased that the bottle leaked while stored in a plastic bag on it's side. The top was tight. That was probably just a one time deal.",cats,2
"You wouldn't think it from looking at them, but my dog can make his way through one of these in an afternoon, it's incredible. Maybe if they were more tightly packed or something, that would be great, but as it is, I can only give him one every once in a while because otherwise he'd get fat!",dogs,3
"I purchased the Snoozer Oversized pet car seat for our Westie...he loves to go for car rides. We had some long trips planned this summer and I didn't want him on my lap or my husbands the entire time. I ordered this car seat specifically because it will go either in the front or back seat, and allows Kramer to look out the window, which is his favorite thing to do while in the car...all while being secure in the car. He loved it from the first short trip....and usually sleeps most of the time. There is plenty of room for him to sit up or lay down and sleep. I would highly recommend this to anyone who travels with their dog.",dogs,3
My silly cat thinks he's human and needed to drink from a glass while the water ran in the sink. I got really tired of going to pour him a glass every time he needed a sip of water. He loves the fountain and now goes to get his own drinks.It's wonderfully easy to take apart and keep clean. The only problem was the filter made the motor and interior parts feel slimy. I just took that out and problem solved.,cats,2
"I bought this product to feed a cat while away and so far have not had any problems with the unit. Runs on a 9 volt battery and has freezable ice packs in the bottom for keeping wet food cold but haven't tried that yet. The only slight problem is getting the central core unit aligned once it is reinserted after filling the food tray. If it is not inserted all the way down, the central core will spin vs the tray opening. Has an advance button to check the functioning before using. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",cats,2
Its great and amazing. If you've a cat with medium to long hair you want this. Period. Period. Period. Period.,cats,2

"This has got to be the best litter box I have ever bought, and I have tried a few. It is so easy to use. I had the kind that plug in and scoop themselves, it broke in a few months, very hard to clean too. This one is only three parts and it works exactly like the ads say. Just simplicity itself! Roll it and the bars inside screen the litter, the clumps drop over into the drawer as you roll if right side up! Then pull out drawer and dispose of clumps and waste! The cats used it right away, no problems there. I highly recomend this box, I am seriously thinking of buying some for Christmas presents!",cats,2
"This crate was set up in literally 30 seconds. Good quality materials, easy transport, and perfect when combined with a nice bed to put in it.",dogs,3
We bought this product for our Bichon Frise. Within a couple weeks we could see a difference in her eyes. We are on our 2nd month using it and will continue to buy it for our dog. She doesn't even to seem to notice it on her food. Some said it made their dogs sick at their stomach but we haven't had any problems with the Angel Eyes. Definitely recommend this for anyone who has an all white dog with tear stains. It works great!!!!,dogs,3
My dog is not a big chewer but she loves to chew on this. I've purchased 3 of these. One nice thing about these is that if your dog chews down one end you can unscrew the the other end and save it to attach to a new middle part the next time your dog chews up just 1 end.,dogs,3
"I spent quite a bit of time reading reviews for several automatic litter boxes before I settled on the ScoopFree model (with the cover). I've been using it for about 2 1/2 months now, and I love it. No scooping,no constant cleaning of tracked in litter all over the floor! I have it out on my patio deck (even though the instructions say indoor use only)and it has worked like a dream. I followed the advice in the instructions and placed the box near my cat's old box, which I refrained from cleaning. However, she kept using the dirty old bax and after a few days I couldn't take it anymore. I took away the old box leaving a bit of the used litter in the ScoopFree box. She took to the new box immediately and has been using it ever since. I thought she might be afraid of the noise and motion of the rake, but she is more curious that scared. In fact after she does her business she waits around for the 20 minutes it takes to activate, so she can see it move. I have found that after about 3 1/2 weeks the litter gets rather pungent, and the smell remains on my cat's paws. I've begun to experiment with scooping out some of the litter and replacing it with another brand of crystal litter to see if I can extend the amount of time between cartridge replacements. Some of the reviews I read said their cats would not use the crystal litter. I started mixing my cat's clumping litter with crystal litter about a week or so before I introduced the ScoopFree box. As I scooped her old box daily I'd remove some of the clumping litter and add the crystals. By the time she got to the new litter box she was fine with the crystals. My cat is only 2 years old and very good about using a litter box, so my success with ScoopFree may be because she is an easy, non-fussy cat. I am a bit concerned about what to do when the rainy season comes, as I will either have to move it indoors or go back to the old box on the patio. However, as for right now ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box is like a dream come true.",cats,2
My dogs and I love nylabones. They are a safe chew toy that keeps my dogs entertained and last a long time. I like that nylabones come in different flavors; it keeps my dogs more interested. I was very satisfied with the shipping of this product. It came much sooner than expected,dogs,3

"Our little 6 pound toy Yorkshire Terrier really loves to play fetch. When we bought our first Chuckit Mini Launcher it changed the game for us. I was able to throw it farther and could pick it up without having to bend way over. It was the new model that has a shorter shaft than this one does so I could only throw it about 40 yards (which is far more than I can throw a ball by hand). Still Bella (the Yorkie) loves to run far and fast so when I discovered this launcher with a longer shaft I wanted to give it a shot.I love this thrower! I can not only toss the ball over 60-65 yards but I can throw it really high as well. When it finally hits the ground it bounces like crazy so Bella has a chance to catch it in the air. The tennis-type ball that comes with the thrower is not the one that I use since it is not very heavy and won't go very far. I recommend the 2"" Ultra ball and I have purchased a few sets of them. The 2"" Chuckit system is great for small dogs of all breeds.Chuckit! Ultra Ball Small 2-inch, 2 packChuckit! New Mini Launcher (Colors Vary)",dogs,3

"One of our cats recently underwent an emergency perineal urethrostomy because of a severe urinary tract blockage. The vet recommended I put him on a prescription diet, specifially Science Diet c/d. My cats have never liked Science Diet, and honestly, I haven't either. I went to a local specialty pet food store and they recommended Wysong Uretic. My cats have been on it for six months now and have not had an urinary issues. My cat recently had a urinanalysis and all his 'levels' were good! I'm a big believer in Wysong! It's a higher quality food and it's worth the premium you pay. My cats love it, too!",cats,2

"The Zodiac Breakaway collar is the ONLY one I will use on my cat.Been using these for decades.I don't like the drops and the non-breakaway type is not something I would put on an outdoor cat.Even if they only go out sometimes, they can get caught on a branch or whatever and I would rather give them a fighting chance by having a collar that breaks away.",cats,2
"That really says it all.My older, female cat doesn't care. But my six-month-old kitten? I can't touch him, I can't touch his banana, and I can't go near anything that's near his banana--lest I feel his crazy baby feline wrath. He even attacked the UPS box when it arrived--that's how I knew it was his toy. He entertains himself for hours and I'm happy that he's happy, but the only minor issue I have is that this toy is difficult to keep clean--especially if, like my cat, your cat drags it into dark, secret, dirty places; the surface collects dirt rather easily. Wiping it down (or attempting to) only renews his interest to the point that it's difficult to work around him, so I just leave it wherever he feels like leaving it and plan to buy one or two more.",cats,2

"Back in 2004, when remodeling my house, I've bought a PetSafe door (actually, two of them) and got my contractor to install proper wall and door passages. I've replaced the doors once and now they are due for another replacement. On PetSafe Web site, I found that this type and size is called ""Ultimate Extra-Large"". To my surprise, nobody is carrying this type anymore. The current models are usually narrower and taller. What am I supposed to do, remodel the house again? Changing the shape of stucco cutoff is quite expensive!I will never buy PetSafe product again if they are not able to provide proper long-term support. I don't mind if they change colors or materials, but they should at least support previous door sizes, because walls and doors have much longer life span than pet doors.",cats,2

"This will be the last pooper scooper you ever need to buy.I've tried several of the pooper scoopers that are $20-$30 and they all pale in comparison to this one. Why anyone needs to spend MORE then $30 is beyond me, it just scoops up excrement. I can't believe it took me this many years to find this after owning several dogs for years now.This thing is 1/3rd the price of the average scooper sold in stores and solid as a rock and simple. No more springs and cheap plastic breaking in the winter trying to angle them to scoop up a frozen excrement pile from a large dog. This thing works better then I had hoped for and I can't believe it's not sold in as many stores. Then again, they probably would rather sell the cheap plastic one's for 2-3x the cost for more profit.Highly recommended for dogs especially. It lifts the excrement right out of any grass, snow, etc and you can't break it. IT's a thick enough gauge steel that it won't bend unless you're putting ALOT of weight on it. This will probably last the rest of our life. It's even coated so that the metal won't rust. That's how solid it is.",dogs,3
I puchased the device for my 1 year old Golden Retriever. She's overall very well trained and obedient however I live on a 15 acre farm and she ocassionally runs off chasing squirell's or rabbits. This collar is amazing. After the first use I have a new dog; she'll come to me regardless of the distraction. I love the tone feature; 99% of the time that's all I need. I tested the collar against my leg (didn't want to be mean to the dog). Really not a big deal or painful thing but definitely an attention getter. Only thing I would like to see as an enhancement is a backlight on the LED screen. Kinda hard to see what level your at once the sun goes down. Otherwise the range is fantastic!!!! One reviewer mentioned that the warranty applies only if purchased via an authorized dealer. I checked with the company and Amazon is now an authorized dealer so no warranty issues. (12/2010),dogs,3
"I've been using this on my dog for almost 5 years. She never has fleas or ticks. The only drawback is that it looks kind of bad for a few days after applying. Even though I get it down under her fur onto her skin, (she's a lab/boxer mix) there seems to be a film on her back fur that picks up dust and dirt. It also smells. And you have to wait a few days before bathing your dog. But it's worth it to not have any fleas! And never any side effects on my dog. I'm sticking with this product.",dogs,3
"I originally got this to supplement my HOB filter for my 75 gallon tank, but the flow of both filters combined was too strong for my guppies. When trying to decide which filter to keep on the tank, it was no contest. This filter is near silent (especially compared to my noisy HOB) and has way more filtration capacity than my poor little HOB filter could ever hope to have. It was a little tricky to prime initially, but once I re-read the directions I caught my mistake and it worked perfectly. The media baskets are big and allow for a lot of customization, and are easy to yank out and clean as needed. The only annoyance I have is that the grated dividers that you can use to separate parts of a basket are very buoyant, so the top divider of the middle basket can sometimes float up and block the top basket from setting down correctly. I got around this by not using that divider and it works fine. Depending on the media you use, how much you feed, whether you have live plants or not, etc, you will need to clean and/or swap out media every 2-4+ weeks to keep things flowing well, but this is true of any filter. Just keep an eye on how much flow is coming out of the filter and clean or replace the polishing pads when it slows down.",fish aquatic pets,4
"AquaClear is a great brand. The foam I got did seem a little cheaper quality than the foam that came with the filter. Since it came in a 3 pack, I used only one since they last forever and decided to cut up the others to fit my smaller filters.Out of this 3 pack and after cutting some up I ended up getting:1 for my 702 for my 502 for my 30and a home made slip for the tube so the fry don't get sucked up into the filter.UPDATED 10/4/2012I have 3 Aquaclear 70 filters and I have gone through about 3 boxes not even in one year. The replacements continue to fall apart just after 2 months. The last time I bought was the worst quality yet. I'll be looking into something else for now.*The original foam that came with the filter is still excellent and still using it, it's just the replacements that are crap*",fish aquatic pets,4
These bags are great!! We've been using these for years. I like that they are dark colored (either green or brown). Everyone knows what it is but who wants to see it.

We turn our back and she moves the chairs around to get on top the table to snack on whatever could be left. After trying a number of things, we finally bought this collar. We set it pretty low and tested it...nothing. We put in on 5, watched out dog try to get on the table and ZAP! she jumped right off. We have kept the collar on her and use it when she nears the table. We use the sound feature for other training, like barking, and it works well.My suggestion is to buy extra batteries as they run low quickly. Also be sure to buy the collar size closest to your dog size. The small one we bought was still really big.It works!",dogs,3

The extra links added to the cost of the collar and I had to buy it from a third party vendor.For the PETA members",dogs,3
"This didn't work for us at all. First, I think there's a good chance that the product I received is broken. The plunger sticks and is very hard to move even a little bit. Once I finally got it to move to put the pill in, it didn't pop the pill out when I depressed the plunger. The second problem is that the tip is the wrong size for two out of three different pills my cat has to take. The largest is to big, and the smallest is too small. One pill fit, but as I mentioned before, once I placed it in the tip, I couldn't get the piller to pop it out (the rod was too short to push the pill out). This item was an epic fail for me, and its now in the trash. I suggest trying another style of pet piller (even though they're more expensive, the right one really can help!)",cats,2

"I have owned one of these for three years now, and it is the single best investment I have made for my two cats and one dog. All of them love the water flowing down the ramp, especially the cats. Very quiet and low maintenance item. Yes, I do go in and clean off the pump intake once a week (have a long haired cat). About a year ago, the pump stopped working. I went online and found simple directions as to how to get it going again. Worked like a charm, and no problems since. I do take it apart once every few months for a check and cleaning if need be.My model (just like the one pictured on Amazon) does an amazing job of ""sucking up"" all the smaller bits of grass, hair, and gunk that get into the bowl on occasion. No pump this size will keep the bowl totally pristine, so I do keep an eye on it, and pick out larger ""stuff"" (bugs, blades of grass, etc...)All I can say is",cats,2

Keeps them stimulated and exercising and gives me a little reprieve to do other things - however, i find myself watching them play with it instead.",dogs,3
I moved into a new apartment and got brand new furniture. At our old place we always allowed the cat to come up on the couches and he had a bad habit of scratching all of our furniture. So when we moved into our new place we thought we would try these out while we trained him to use a post. They were easy to put on (with a little patience). I basically had to follow my cat around the house for about 45 minutes to put them on one at a time while keeping him interested in being around me by using his favourite toy.7 weeks later they are still on. I got my cat theSmartCat Ultimate Scratching Postand trained him on it using treats which I tucked away in the seams of the post. He now only uses the scratching post and we no longer need the soft claws. We have actually been waiting for them to fall off and they still haven't. They really worked well as a damage control device for that transitional period during which we were training our cat to use the post and not the furniture. I would recommend these as a temporary fix to protect your furniture while you train your cat.Update,cats,2

She rolls on it and rubs her back on it daily to get her scent on it and seldom let's it out of her sight or reach when outside. She used to tear up the round ones but not this one. Last night it was seemingly carried off by an intruder and she was beside herself looking for it today.

"My dog used to pull all the time. Walking always seemed to make my arms/shoulders really sore. We first attempted teh Gentle Leader head collar... but my dog absolutely hated it. With the Easy Walk harness, my dog really doesn't pull at all. It's almost impossible to pull! My dog seems really happy with it too. You can tell that he's now trying really hard to walk with me & not pull. The only downside is that we need to replace the harness about once a year. We get a LOT of walks out of it!",dogs,3
"hair I got off my 2 labs. Recieved the FURmanator and put it to work right away. Works as advertised. I was able to get off a lot of the deep coat from my labs (1 female 4 yr/10mo, 1 male 3 yr/6 mo). It sure has cut down on all the loose hair that they generate during a day. I can actuallly see most of my carpet now!One reminder is to take it easy on the dogs when 1st using the FURManator. My female didn't care as she loves to be groomed, but the male is still having a hard time with this brushing idea...It truns into fun time inside or outside.I'd recommend that you have an area where you groom your pets with this item, and have a collection recepticle close by, as you will get a ""Ton"" of loose hair off your pet.",cats,2
"Although I read some reviews that were iffy, I decided to try this product. One of my cats (a rescued feral that we have had for 10 years) had taken up urinating in inappropriate places-- most recently into floor registers. Ugh! Cleanup has been a huge problem. So Hercules was going to the vet for the Big Sleep unless we could solve the behavior problem.The long and short of it that this has done a great job in stopping that behavior. I am using three dispensers near the three locations that he had targeted. Now I find him sleeping just opposite one of the dispensers, a sure sign that this comforts him.This is my second cycle with this product. The bottles have actually lasted somewhat longer than the company states. It is worth every penny to keep our household sane.",cats,2

"We have a Bernese Mountain Dog Puppy. Need I say more. They are a double coated long hair breed, and even though I would brush her several times a week with any of the assorted dog brushes we have acquired over the years we ALWAYS had dog hair in the house. Our Vet. recommended the FURminator on our first visit but I didn't want to pay the $59.99 that he was selling them for. Thank goodness for amazon.com! I got a new one for less than $22.00, and it came in 3 days without special shipping. The FURminator is Amazing! It really goes beyond being a brush and is a deShedding Tool like they advertise. It was especially beneficial when she was shedding her puppy coat and getting her adult coat. My only recommendation is brush your dog outside in clothes you don't mind getting covered in dog hair because you will get covered in dog hair. Our dog's coat has never looked healthier, or as shiney. This is hands down a GREAT PRODUCT!",cats,2

"My dog, a 2 year old 12 pound westie, received the ""LARGE"" version for Christmas. While it's a ""little"" big for her, she absolutely loves it. She runs around the entire house squeeking one end, and then the other end. I did not see that it had a double squeaker until she got a hold of it.She loves terrorizing the squirrels in the back yard but has never been able to catch one. Now she gets to terrorize this stuffed animal and practice, waiting for the real thing to make a mistake and fall into her jaws. She ignores ALL of her other toys now, and we play rough with this. Tug of war, throwing, dragging across the house and there is not one sign of a loose thread or a tear or anything with this toy.A++My only hope is this toy teaches her to run faster in the back yard and finally catch one of those tree rats to make an example for the others as she tosses its furry corpse into the air, squeezing every inch of it looking for the refreshing ""SQUEAK SQUEAK"" sound.",dogs,3

And it's also keeping my small domestic shorthair in tip top shape. 5 stars all around!",cats,2

"I've gotten two of these and they work pretty well once you get them installed up to a point. it's a press fit. after a few weeks the cats continued to knock it out of the screen so I had to drill holes and fit small bolts to hold it in place. no big deal but not what I expected. that lasted for about a year and then the door simply broke off at the hinge. ok, a years worth of service. not bad. bought a replacement. the press fit did not work at all so I installed it from the beginning with bolts - although I had to be careful as the plastic on this one is softer. put the screen back in, flicked the door a few times... and the magnet on the new one is so weak a small breeze will hold it open. so yes, it works, but certainly not what I expected. I have my doubts on how long this replacement will last and next time I'll have to replace the screen and will be trying a different manufacturer.",cats,2
"My Dalmatian mix is about 50 pounds and this is a good size bed for her. She would never lay on her old dog bed as the furniture was more comfy, but she absolutely loves this Donut bed! When I call for her, she just stares at me because she doesn't want to get out of her bed! The sherpa is nice and soft and the bottom of the bed has a sturdy material different than the sides. The only downside to this bed, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a slipcover and it is large, so I won't be able to wash it in the washing machine.",dogs,3

The Spray Sense collars used to be great and last a long time. In the last year I have bought 5 and they either broke after a couple of weeks or didn't work at all out of the box.

They look the same as the ones I returned.,dogs,3
"I used this for the first time in my sister's new apartment. Supposedly, she was renting a pet and smoking free apartment. The unit we looked at was spotless. The one we walked into the day of the move-in, however, smelled horridly of cat pee. They had a so-called professional come in to shampoo the carpets but their efforts did squat for the odor. We took advantage of the apartment still being empty and rented a rug doctor to do all of the carpets ourselves. We used nature's miracle in the shampooer and, holy cow, you would not believe how awesome it works! Honestly, you would have to see the used water we were dumping out of the rug doctor. Anyways, it works like a charm! The apartement no longer stinks and I will be keeping a steady supply of this stuff for the future. It works on everything, not just pet stains!",dogs,3

"I have been purchasing these cookies for years now. They are healthy, large enough for my large dog, they smell delicious, and my dog loves them! Plus they are so reasonably priced, you can't find anything better or cheaper in any store. Wal Mart used to sell them years ago, but they stopped, so I was buying them directly from Blue Dog Bakery. When I found them on Amazon I was thrilled. They're eligible for Amazon Prime, I order them by the case (6 boxes), they arrive in 2 days, and my dog has a big smile on her face when the box arrives!! I Tried many other treats, by many other companies, but Blue Dog Bakery is by far the best!They also come in a variety of flavors, and sizes, I think. Plus they make other types of snacks too. Great company for healthy treats! They smell so good, they're hard to resist!!",dogs,3
"Very sturdy. Quality materials. No problems with assembly. Had to spend two days coaxing our 16 month-old, 55 lb. Leopard Dog onto the bed (she would give me that look asking if I'd lost my mind). Finally convinced her to give it a try when I put her pad on top. Now, she won't sleep anywhere else. She used to get up frequently to change position on her orthopaedic pad - with the Coolaroo she sleeps through the night. Also keeps her pad from scooting across the floor so that the room looks neater (and makes for easier vacuuming - one hand to move the bed instead of dragging her pad back and forth). Would purchase her a replacement in a heartbeat, but can't imagine this one wearing out. Also, the large is the perfect size for her. Lots of stretching-out room, but not oversized.",cats,2
"I was excited to get this litter box, as I have two indoor cats and scoop and bag litter every day to toss in the Dumpster outside my apartment building. I was thrilled with it for days and my cats had no trouble getting used to it. But it doesn't always get everything and it's difficult to get in there to scrape stuff off so it can make it into the drawer. A weekend away will result in a very full drawer, but also a few poops and scoopable litter lumps scattered in the litter. Plus, the latches on the outside of the box are hard to line up. I always end up with one that is almost impossible to get in.It's a great idea and I still like it, but it doesn't feel like the best thing ever anymore. Then again, I don't think there *is* a cat litter solution that is the best thing ever!",cats,2

"My dog got a pair of pink Doggles last winter after I realized the K9 Optix style wasn't going to fit her wide muzzle. At first she dragged her face on the pavement...then pawed at them...then gave in to the notion that if she pulled them off, I would put them back on. She likes to put her head out of the window (what dog doesn't?) on bye bye rides...the Doggles keep her from getting corneal abrasions from minute debris that flies through the air. This year, I got her a pair of the Chrome Doggles so they would match more items in her wardrobe. If you put the Doggles on a little bit at a time, the dog will get used to them.

My cat and the next door neighbours cat enjoy eating this stuff. They were a bit unsure at the start but after a few days they gulp it down with gusto. If they want some fresh meat then they can always eat some hoppers or rodents.

"It is very large (but not so large as to be ridiculous or anything, it fits one cat nicely). Be sure to measure the area you plan to use for the catbox and make sure this cat box will fit in that space or you'll be wandering your house looking for a new catbox location. That is it's only drawback, is if you have limited area for the catbox and this one won't quite fit. If you have the area it will fit in, though I highly recommend this one over smaller boxes. It has the top beige edge that catches almost all flying litter which is a problem with lower edged catboxes. I just line it with the jumbo liners provided and buy a wonderbox (I highly recommend the wonderbox, it'll change your catbox upkeep experience like you wouldn't believe) to place on top of the liner, put the litter inside the wonderbox and there is just no fuss and no muss. The petfood dish set that comes with the box is a nice bonus. It's rather large I thought for a cat but actually it's not too large. My cat likes the larger dish to move her head in to pick up her food I've noticed. I would absolutely recommend this catbox and dish set.",dogs,3
"I picked this up on impulse hoping that my 8-month-old kitten would use the scratching pad in the center. (She loves to scratch in the ""horizontal"" plane rather than the vertical scratching pads we have, and she was tempted by carpets in the house.)When it arrived, all 3 cats were intrigued by the catnip. The kitten, however, went for the ball in the circular track, and promptly popped it out and chased it around. I replaced it, but this pattern continued for several days.The kitten does love to scratch the center cardboard, and it has become quite worn in the past month. I am pleased to see that the refills are not extraordinarily expensive, as I will surely be needing some soon.Our middle cat can occupy himself for quite some time with the ball in the track...he loves to pounce, lay on it, bat the ball back and forth.And the oldest cat (at just 4 years) couldn't really care less, as you cannot eat any part of the toy!So...all in all, at 2 of 3 cats approved, not a bad purchase...and the kitten has decided that the toy is more fun if she leaves the ball in the track, so we're not hunting for it anymore..",cats,2

I guess you get what you pay for. The gate was cheap in every way. It does not lock securely into the door frame. If the plastic pieces on the end were made from rubber instead of plastic it might grip better but I can pull it out of the door frame pretty easily. When my dog gets bigger I'm sure she'll be able to knock it down with no problem. Also the little pet door is HUGE and had to be modified so the dog couldn't squeeze through. I should have just gotten a baby gate and modified it so my cats can fit through.,dogs,3

"We wanted a pump for the quart sized Listerine bottles we use. It was a pain to try pouring from that bulky bottle, I figured I'd try these. THEY WORK FAIRLY WELL. Without modification, they &#34;kind of&#34; screw onto the top (the threads are NOT identical, but close enough to work). The intake tube reaches all the way to the bottom of the bottle. The body of the pump that goes into the bottle/container is big, so we had to empty some of the contents to allow for that. The spout drips after pumping, but I found that if I &#34;flick&#34; the spout with my finger, it knocks out the few drops remaining in the tip and it won't drip. JUST BE ADVISED .... The pump when unlocked sits about 5 inches above the top of the bottle. So unless you have an open counter or shelf, this pump, if left on the container, will add at least 5 inches to the height.",cats,2

After 4 years of regular use it still looks new (weekly cleaned).I don't see any flaw in this product.",cats,2
"My two cats love this scratching post. They use it for scratching in preference to all their other scratching items / toys, and they also like to climb on it while playing. The height allows the kitties to stretch as they scratch, which seems to make them happier.Best of all, this scratching post is attractive and fits in with a modern, leather/chrome/beechwood decor. Much better than the carpeted alternative.My only complaint is that the post slides around when the cats jump onto it, despite the larger base.",cats,2
"I bought this in desparation, hoping this would keep my cat out of a room that she had urinated in. No luck. Half the time it wouldn't give off any charge at all. I even had the power adaptor, so it was plugged in the wall. Regardless of what power level I put it on, it still sporatically worked. Then the one time it did shock the cat, she jumped straight into the air and onto the other side of the mat (in the bedroom) and was too afraid to come back out of the room.",dogs,3
"Purchased this for my ball/toy obsessed Border Collie. We ration it, as it is definitely his favorite toy, and produce this anytime he steals a toy from another dog, and need him to give it up.",dogs,3
Hands down the best investment I've made since venturing into the fish keeping hobby. I was hesitant to get a bigger tank than the 55 gallon I already had because I wasn't interested in the amount of work it would be to do water changes. After buying the python I quickly upgraded to not only a 75 gallon but also a 125 gallon as well. Literally makes water changes effortless. I would give it six stars if possible.,fish aquatic pets,4
"We were having issues where our little girl was being quite unladylike and trying to get into the toilet. I thought maybe it had to do with her water dish. I was a little hesitant to dish out this much money for a cat water bowl, but boy am I glad I bought this item.The instruction book warns that it might take a little while for kitty to gt used to the motor sound and drink from the fountain. Yeah, like 10 seconds! We've had it for about 2 weeks and we have not caught little miss lingering in the bathroom or trying to drink from the toilet!We haven't had to clean the fountain yet, but we ordered the brush kit so we'll be ready. I concur that this is an item that would be hard to clean without the brush kit so just buy it all at once and save on the shipping later. We also ordered extra filters.Not only does our cat like to drink from this item, but our ferret has gotten past splashing in it and will take a sip every so often as well. I agree with keeping the food bowl a slight distance as the food will clog the water intake.Our only complaint is that the constant sound of the water will make YOU need to go potty more often!LOVE THIS CAT FOUNTAIN!",cats,2
"I read all the reviews and followed the advice of one which stated to buy the product where it is listed as ""sold from Amazon"". If you are concerned about an inferior product, just be sure to read the descriptions from each seller carefully before your purchase. This item worked as effectively as Frontline purchased through my vet, plus I saved about $20. I applied roughly 3 weeks ago and not a single sign of fleas on all 4 dogs.",dogs,3
"I have used these before and simply needed a new one in black. The item came in a timely fashion and was new in its package.Gentle leaders really do work. If your dog pulls or acts aggressively buy one of these.Sizing can be a little confusing. We have a normal size American Cocker Spaniel and the small just fits him with a small amount of room to spare. The small also fits our smallish Beagle with a more slender nose, do not get to caught up in worrying about size as these have some good adjustment room to them.",dogs,3
"Works well, easy to set up, very convenient. The cat took to it well; was fascinated when the rake starts moving. The only downside I can think of is the price. Otherwise, there's really nothing to complain.",cats,2
"The pen arrive promptly, and was easy to assemble. We have it in the octagon pattern which allows the most romp area for our 2 mischievious little pups. There is also room for a medium a bed, large pee pad and water dish. The set up is stable, our puppies are between 10 and 15 lbs, and have yet to knock it over... and they have tried. My only complant is that a few of the edges were quite sharp and had to be filed down.",dogs,3
"Besides the Kong, that is! If you have a dog that loves to play fetch, buy this! Everytime it comes out of the closet my dog goes nuts and she can't stop fetching until I make her and put it up high and away! Cannot beat the exercise you give your dog with this, either.",dogs,3
"It is a happy accident, but we have most of the Kong toys that are similar to this, we have this bear, the medium frog, and the (now retired) duck. They last a while for our two 9 lb. Pomeranian/Chihuahua mix dogs. We found out that Moxie likes to eat the faces off of toys because of this bear (that we got as a ""welcome home"" present when we picked her up from the rescue). My husband and I think it's hilarious. She didn't tear the face off in one day, but we rotate toys twice a week to prevent boredom. Moxie is the BIG chewer. It's quite impressive actually, but not when I find out there's holes in my shirt. I recommend, especially because there is almost no stuffing, so there isn't really any hunting for Mr. Bear's insides. I feel the toy lasted long enough, and I plan on getting them a new one.",dogs,3

"Short of handstripping, this thing does an amazing job! Better on my wrist then my Mars stripping blade.I dont understand how people claim this thing ""cuts"" the hair? (Which is true with a new Mars blade if not used correctly.) I was afraid after reading numerous reviews of this... so what better way to test it then on my own hair??? ha ha ha I have very thick, brittle, chemically abused mid back hair, and this thing didnt break a SINGLE strand! Amazed, I tackled down the nearest male to see if this will hold true for a ""shorter"" participant, my 63 year old father with short, thinning, fine hair, and again, not a strand.I've kept sessions really short (about 5 min every 3-4 days) as my Westie hates getting brushed to begin with, and already what a remarkable difference! (Best to get them after a good long walk when theyre all pooped out.) The only hair that is removed is the hair ready to be shed anyways. Already she looks much more kempt and looks as though she lost 10lbs! I will never submit to clipping again as I want to keep a nice hard wiry coat on her! (Keeps her dirt free and nice and dry since I have a water baby who likes the pouring rain and likes to roll in bird poop....AND she's an all white dog! I've also been ""experimenting"" on how long I can go without bathing her before someone in my household complains.... I have a very weak sense of smell...So I guess I'm lucky, but my mom and siblings have allergies and are very sensitive to smell, and they will NOT hesitate to raise heck since she's MY dog...but I've gone literally 6 months and no complaint yet...AND she's still white looking.... lol)",cats,2
"I have three dogs, this works on one of them, doesn't seem to do a thing for the other two. One thing to check is push the test button on the unit. You'll get a red light but you should also barely hear a whirling sound as the unit spins up. I've had these where the light came on and no mechanism activating inside after a few weeks of use- that's a sign to return it for a new one. It advertised as inaudible to humans so you'll only hear it when within a few inches.",dogs,3
The seed germinated in about 10 days and my cat eats some daily. I have kept him monitored to make sure he doesn't overdue it. My little guy is on a prescription diet for the rest of his life but the grass hasn't harmed him. I am very pleased with my purchase.,cats,2
"Had problems getting it from supplier. Does not get rid of the fleas as well as advertised. Make sure you wear gloves and spray outside. If dog is infested, make sure you give flea bath first to get rid of initial fleas. I spray before we go on a walk but dogs still come home with fleas.",cats,2
"Our beagle has been yellowing our lawn with her urine, which has been resulting in the grass eventually dying and us being left with patches we need to repair. We've been using this for about 3 months (including the liquid version over this last month) and it has not improved anything - we simply have new yellow spots to worry about. I've heard it works for some dogs - might be worth trying out for yours....I don't know if it's the dog or the lawn, but we unfortunately have not seen a difference.",dogs,3

"There were no directions included with the cage, but if you look at all the peices and open them up, its pretty easy.Our kids (4 and 7yrs) are quite happy with the new cage, and so are the rats. The bar spacing is to far apart for mice or dwarf hamsters, but anything bigger should do quite well.The bottom tray snaps out for easy cleaning, which is a big plus over the other cage design we have that requires the whole cage be torn apart each time you want to change the bedding.Check all plastic for chew damage. Some hamsters, mice, rats will chew on plastic and find a way out.",small animals,5
"I researched this stand online, and it got very poor reviews on other sites. But after ordering one myself, I am very happy to say that this stand is great!

"Our outdoor cat loves this bed warmer. I wrapped it in a piece of polar fleece and tucked it into her $10 cat bed on the shelf of our outdoor (mostly unheated) shed, and ever since she then, she LOVES the shed. Before, she would only go in there when she absolutely had to, for food and water. Now she spends all night and a good part of the day in there as well, especially when it's below freezing. The only complaint I have about this product is that the cord is pretty short (about 3ft), so make sure you have an extension cord on hand. As for longevity, we've only been using it for about a month so I can't comment on that yet (will update).",dogs,3

All my pets (2 beagles and an old lady tabby cat) are happy to be brushed with it, and they lean into it once I get started.

"It is weird that ""Pet-Tinic "" is under fire. I have been giving my Sheltie this product all of her life for 8 years. She gets only 1/8th of a teaspoon in the morning mixed with about let's say an inch of bannana mashed in her food thouroughly for potassium.She loves it and jumps off my bed to get it in the morning. This helps bone structure, especially in a dogs senior years. Arthrtitis is something I am going all out to avoid. Just the other day she went in for her annual bloodwork and is fine and she is in perfect health. Just don't over do it. Once a day according to weight. Seems people might not be following directions. And as for corn syrup and other addivites like lead, What are we eating and drinking? It goes both ways and I back this product 100%Here is a tip...Try introducing vegetables and fruits to your pets diet as a snack. Avoid acid related one's.Carrots, Watermeleon, (The red one) Apples and especially Bannana are great nutrients. Use a Brita water system for fresh water.Never give them chocolate, grapes or onions. They are highly toxic!",cats,2
"We have four cats - they're all very different. Every one loves this toy! It's a long piece of doubled over felt securely attached to a sturdy plastic wand. The felt flows very well and is a great air toy as well as a great ground toy (think very active snake). My cats who love to jump love the toy and they get high jumps out of it. When four very different cats love it, it's a winner in my book.",cats,2

"Like other reviewers, I found this feeder to be unnecessarily complicated to program. The three-button design makes for a very clean and simple-looking control panel, but this comes at the expense of ease-of-use. Thankfully the instructions that come with it are fairly detailed, and once you set the machine it doesn't need any further programming until the battery dies (and with a reported battery life of a year, this isn't very often.) Despite these shortcomings in programming, the price can't be beat for convenience (especially for those of us with animals who think 4 am is breakfast time!)The construction is solid, and the hopper and lid screw on very tightly, so other reviewers who had a problem with this probably did not assemble it properly. Further, the gear mechanism which dispenses the food is set several inches back in a small channel, so it would take a very cunning animal to get a paw in there and release even a single extra nugget of food.However, the most important thing to remember is that this is meant to be an accessory to you giving your pet attention, not a substitute. It's important that you still play with them, monitor their behavior, and keep an eye on their eating habits. Don't leave it to machines to do everything for them or you'll end up with a very maladjusted and anti-social animal.",cats,2
The product itself is fine. Just open the carrot and pour in the catnip. My cats liked it at first but hardly touch them now. I guess they aren't that interested in catnip.,cats,2

BUUUUT if your dog is driving you crazy barking buy this and see if it works for you because if it did I would LOVE it, my dog is just too dumb unfortunatly.",dogs,3

If applied right at onset it goes away fairly quickly. A little goes a long way! I highly recommend! A++",cats,2

I just tell them they have to get their ""Big Girl Panties"" on when they come in and they just stand there and wait for their treat :) I use regular human maxi pads with wings to put inside. Will buy several pairs this time just in case they ever stop making them. Highly recommend. BevSanitary Pants, X-Large - Black",dogs,3
"Yes, I saw the video of the Golden Retriever being groomed and yes, I went to the product website to confirm that the Furminator was recommended for use on my two Boxer dogs. Moreover, I was impressed with the volume of positive reviews on Amazon.So I decided to give it a try on my dogs.Unfortunately, their short, coarse hair doesn't remove well with this tool. The fine teeth in the blade can't get a grip on their thicker hair. The result is a lot of brushing and very few hairs removed. A saw tooth shedding blade removes about ten times more hair on this type of coat than does the Furminator, so I use one of those now.This is a fairly costly item for what it does. I don't believe that this product should have been recommended for Boxers as it does poorly with thicker, wiry hair.It is effective however, with thinner, softer types of hair as evidenced by the Amazon video. It also did an admirable job of grooming my girlfriend's cat, so I gave the Furminator to her. But I feel somewhat deceived by the manufacturer. It may be an amazing tool in some applications but in others it's not at all.Potential buyers should investigate carefully whether this tool will work well in their application or they may be disappointed.",cats,2

"We got this to keep my mini daschund out of the kitchen. Unfortunately we have an open kitchen the range doesn't quite reach both ends. The range is also very sketchy. Sometimes it won't beep and you're right next to it, other times it works out to the 6 feet (this is when it's on the same range setting). Fortunately for me Hershey is an extremely neurotic dog. He got zapped one time and now he stays away from the entire area as soon as we put the collar on. He has figured out though that if the collar isn't on he can go in and be safe. I would love to not have to put the collar on all the time as it looks rather uncomfortable for him to wear. But every animal is different. Daschunds are incredibly stubborn and too smart for their own good so I'm happy that it works at all!For those of you worried about a small animal (cat or dog) Hershey is 10 pounds and it has had no ill effects on him.",dogs,3

This brush doesnt work on furniture at all. My hand does a better job at gathering hair on the couch. I dont recommend this brush for anyone.

I purchased these from a vendor who had them priced half what the local pet store wanted. These are pricey -- but worth it. My kitty needs three pills a day.

I will continue to buy these as long as he is satisfied.,cats,2
"OK so got these not sure what they were like. I'm used to gettting pig ears which are more crunchy. I have two dogs. One just loved these the other wont do much with them. Personally, I dont think I would order them again, but would instead go back to the ears or something a little more crunchy. These are basically like 1/4"" to 1/2"" pieces of skin that have been smoked until cured. Though they are a little crunchy they are more like ummm think of a styrofoam texture.The product was well packaged and I would order from the company again, just would get something different.",dogs,3

My 50 pound mutt easily broke the plastic loop when she was at my friend's house. She had to be tied up for safety while visiting because he doesn't have a fence-- when a bunny showed up she busted through the loop instantly. Thank goodness she came right back but it could have been a tragedy. Don't let this happen to your beloved pet. Get a collar with a metal loop for the lead. You never know.On the plus side, Amazon was great with everything about the return, including funding return shipping.",dogs,3
"This thing is awesome. I could use at least 2 more!I have the Ultrasmart fencing system and bought the disk as an add on. it works with the same rechargeable collars that the fence uses and allows me to keep my 3 rowdy mutts out of our game room without the burden of installing a gate.I've seen negative reviews on this system and the only reason I can think of for this is because they don't realize it is an EXTRA zone disk, you have to have a system with a compatible innotek collar or its just a piece of plastic.",dogs,3
"I have four male rats who simply love this hut. It is their ""base of operations"", where they most often sleep and eat, despite their cage being full of other hammocks, hideaways, and igloos. All four pile into it and fit ""comfortably"" (who knows how comfortable rats really are when they pile together? But they do it enough!). My only complaint is that it is not easy to clean. I just ordered my second one because anyone with rats knows they pee on EVERYTHING, and since wood is porous it soaks in and can't ever be fully cleaned out (however, the first hut lasted nine months). It'd be perfect if there was some non-toxic lacquer over it to make it easy to just wipe off! Otherwise, great product; very sturdy and durable.",bunny rabbit central,1

I do have to say that it works much better, and gets much more hair off of our lab with the thicker and longer hair.

I have a Wheaten Terrier and a cheap pair of human clippers work better on her than these. I bought these due to the fast blade change feature which is great. The blades get very hot and are extremely loud - which is protested when trying to trim near the ears. I have to very slowly to get them to cut. The blades make an aweful racket when in use - almost like they are not inserted correctly and are loose. I missed the window for returns or I would have sent them back.,dogs,3

I ordered one of these to try out, before spending money on 2, if it didn't work, and let me tell you, this thing is AWESOME!! It works amazingly on BOTH of our dogs (one boy, one girl), and makes it so I can walk them BOTH by myself now! (I ended up ordering a second after I realized how amazing the first one was!)

I spray it in the area where she is lying on her dog bed about 30 minutes before her grooming appointment.

"1. The bottle dispenses only a VERY small amount of water and a VERY slow rate. Even when you squeeze it with force nothing comes out!2. In order to have the water dispense into the tray, you have to unlock the bottle, turn it upright and lock into place. Once the water container is in place it is useless (see comment 1)3. When locked into place (not dispensing water) it is supposed to be leak proof. Not at all. It leaks. So when I put in it my backpack, everything was wet. I honestly believe that the thing dispenses more water when it's NOT supposed to than when it is supposed to.4. You can't really set it down to have your dog drink out of it because it falls over. Wouldn't be a big deal if it actually dispensed water.So, keeping all of these points in mind, what I did on my day at the park is the following:I tied this thing to my bike's handle bars with the included rope (which is waaaaay to long...I had to wrap it around my bars about 10 times) so it wouldn't leak on me. Instead it kept hitting me in the knee as I rode along to the dog park. When my dog got thirsty, I then spent 5 minutes untying my knot. I grabbed the water bottle, took the top off and poured it into my dogs mouth. Messing with the tray is a joke. Honestly, once again, it doesn't work.It's basically a water bottle. So get a safe plastic water bottle at someplace cheap like Walmart for $2 and just pour it down your dogs mouth....or if you want something that is ""clever and useful"" for a day with your dog, stay away from this thing.",dogs,3

"This is my second littermaid. We purchased this one because we adopted a kitten and did not think our cat would want to share or if it was being used the kitten may not be able to wait and go outside the litterbox. We have the littermaids side by side in the room. This model littermaid is large enough for our 19.12 lb cat (maine coon)to use and he and the kitten love that it is covered (so do I). We reuse the plastic bins as much as possible by emptying the bin into plastic shopping bags (you could probably line the bin with the plastic bag and just pull it out to empty it replacing with a new one so the bin stays clean). I did have a problem emptying the container out as the tent didn't allow the lid to open all the way for emptying so I took a razor blade and cut across the front part of the tent a little so it would open wider and used Scotch fastener strips(like double side tape that fastens) to hold the sides back. The littermaid has no problem scooping up the clumps and putting them into the container. I have a large storage bin that I put a 50/50 mix of Worlds Best Cat Litter multi-cat (even when I only had one cat)and Natures Miracle Cat litter (it is pine scented)and mix together. I found that this combo works great for clumping,minimizing any possible smell and the littermaid works great and smoothly with it. I have also tried the elite mega littermaid but find the air ionizer/filter takes up too much inner litterbox area. I read some comments about noise when it scoops the litter but it is not anywhere as noisy as when your ice tray in the freezer drops ice and don't we all still have our automatic icemakers hooked up? The littermaid is only on for maybe 15-30 seconds to scoop so it is not bothersome at all & ours is on 24/7. There is a little litter that accumulates outside the box but inside the tent but that may be my cat being over zealous with burial, at least the litter is contained inside the tent and not all over the floor. I would buy product again.",cats,2

"Just bought another of these as a backup for our first; what's left of that is finally on its way out after nearly three years. The rope literally didn't last 24 hours in our house, but that ball is still going strong.To be fair, we have a Belgian Malinois that has even killed Kong and Orbee toys; the rope on this was shredded quickly. If you have a moderate to tough chewer, the rope is still pretty sturdy--on the order of the fire hose-type material toys.On the other hand, the ball that you're left with if your dog also murders the tug--though it will have the hole in the center that accomodated the rope-- is dense, tough and darned near indestructible. Ours still has a ton of bounce after nearly three years of constant rough play, and the small rubber ""fingers"" incorporated in its ridges are also well-made. Our dog is just now beginning to pick them out, but it's had more than excessive wear and has stood up much, much longer than we ever anticipated.Another plus to the ball is that the ridged/finger design also seems to help satisfy tendencies to chew and assists in getting gunk off the teeth; we place it high up there ( among other things we try to do) in making our vet dental bills ZERO.Really good product.",dogs,3
"My name is Jewel, I'm an 11 year old African Gray.

Arrived quickly but after using them I have decided they are too small for a lab...even a small lab so will be getting a larger set.I think this would work for a smaller dog fineThe product does work though the rubber was off one of the units when it arrive so I had some fun getting it back on.,dogs,3

So easy to have it at my bedside, with puppy safely inside and reach down periodically to reassure her she isn't alone. I'm convinced this feature is why she was able to settle in on her first night home and, with just 5 minutes of protest, sleep for the next 7 hours with not a peep! (And, being on call for an Emergency room, I'm a very light sleeper and would have woken up if she'd cried!)I have a standard poodle puppy, only 13 lbs now but will get to be 40-45 lbs, and this one will fit her perfectly... at least my older SP (42 lbs) thinks so...

"Unfortunately, it didn't work for us. We have a barking dachsund and he doesn't stop. This item didn't change that.

I sold it in our garage sale a week later.",dogs,3
I actually ordered a size that was too big and had to send them back unopened (so keep that in mind as you read) but they seemed to be the same fabric as a pair I had purchased for $10 at Petsmart. The ones from Petsmart completely wore through after a few times of light wear and one time of harder use. I considered sending these back for the correct size but decided to get a more high-quality pair instead.These might be better for an older dog who isn't super active and doesn't need extremely durable booties.Fast shipping by the company though!,dogs,3
"I bought 2 of these crates for a 60 lb border collie mix, and a 50 lb pitbull/lab mix. They are extremely easy to set up, and roomy enough for both dogs to stretch out. The crates are properly assembled according to the instructions, but both dogs have figured out how to break out without opening the front door, which I'm guessing is why they're so much cheaper than similar crates.The border collie will put all her weight on the top rear corner, and because of the collapsible design and the hinged walls, the stress pops a couple latches loose, detaching one corner of the back panel from the rest of the frame. She has this down to a science, and will break out within minutes of me leaving the room. It looks like the other dog just pushed on the front panel until it warped and popped right off (the metal is very bendable). It's warped to the point where the latches don't even line up now.I was really pleased with the crates for the first week or so, and the dogs love them while I'm here, but I wouldn't recommend this particular crate for clever and/or stronger dogs with separation anxiety.",dogs,3

"This treat ball works great. I use it for my lab's regular feedings. I simply fill the ball with her dog food and let her push it around until she's gotten out all she can. It only took her a few minutes to figure out how it worked when I first got it. Now she's a pro at pushing it around, picking it up, and dropping it to get her food.Each feeding takes about 2 refills to go through her usual dog food amount. When she first started, it would take about 45 minutes for her meal. She's gotten a lot better at it and can finish in about 30. That's better than the roughly 2 minutes it would take to eat her dog food straight from a bowl. I'm no vet, but my understanding is it's much better for them to eat slowly rather than wolf down their food and risk getting too much air in their stomachs.It's also nice because it gives me more time to get ready in the morning without having to worry about her getting into trouble. As long as food keeps popping out of the treat ball, it has her undivided attention.One warning for owners with ""power chewers."" You should not leave the ball with the dog once they have gotten all of the food/treats from it. Mine has already chewed small pieces off, and given enough time with it, could probably chew it in half. As soon as your dog is done, take it away and give them something safer to chew on.All in all, this is a great product that keeps my dog's attention and has completely replaced feeding her from a bowl.",dogs,3

"Every year at the vet office, we would be told that one of our cats had a problem with dental plaque. After going through the trouble to have her teeth cleaned, we figured these would be worth a try even though they are expensive. The cats love them! The only problem is that they are too big for either cat to eat so I cut them in half. The treats have an outer casing though, which is important in helping clean the teeth and is unfortunately very fragile and likely to tear. To slice the treats, I very carefully poke through the casing and the treat all the way around with a knife until it comes apart - a regular slicing motion would tear the casing and reduce the effectiveness of the treat. This is quite time consuming when I open a new package (I split all 50 treats at once to make dispensing easier later), but we have been plaque-free and the cats are happy!",cats,2
"update 2/27:1) I've kept betas for years. Some fish are picky and won't eat this when fed. The trick is to put something in the water they do like (e.g., bloodworms) along with the food.

Pale fish will really brighten up.3) I've found that straight bloodworms aren't as healthy as pellets and bloodworms.

"I first found out about Scat mats about 10 years ago. My mother had, literally, a house full of cats. Many were male, and very territorial. She had spent several thousand dollars on her kitchen cabinets and was unhappy with the male cats jumping up on the counters and spraying her new cabinets, so she tried a Scat Mat. We both tested it on all three settings before subjecting any of the cats to it -- even on the highest setting (as most other reviewers have noted), it's no worse than what you might get from walking across a carpeted floor and touching a metal doorknob. It was effective enough that my mother immediately bought enough to cover all her new counters, as well as the top of her computer desk. I borrowed one, and it didn't take long for my cat to stay off my computer desk.I recently moved out of my apartment, and my cat apparently thought that meant the rules had changed. She started using the couch as a path to get onto the dining room table, so I broke out the Scat Mat for the first time in years and draped it across the end of the table closest to the couch. Kitty jumped on the table once, got a reminder that tables are off-limits, and that has been that. A new kitten I've adopted tried the same thing -- crossing the couch to jump on the dining table. One zap convinced her she didn't need to be there. Unfortunately, the older kitty has just decided that the new kitty means the rules have changed, and has started getting on the kitchen counter. Guess I'll be getting a new Scat Mat for the kitchen, since I prefer to leave the old one on the table (removing all of the temptation to jump on the table would mean rearranging two rooms of furniture, and I have everything right where I want it).One thing I feel MUST be noted here, though. The Scat Mat is NOT a substitute for proper training. It is a DETERRENT, and is most effective as an AID to training. If you buy a Scat Mat to stop unwanted behaviors, then you MUST either provide your pet with suitable alternatives (and teach them to use them), or else be prepared to have to leave the thing out (and turned on) all the time.For example, cats like to have places to perch, rather than being on the floor al the time. Also, when crossing a room, most cats will go out of their way to walk or run across a piece of furniture or other elevated surface. Trying to keep them off of EVERYTHING would be futile. Providing your pet with a suitable alternative to the forbidden area, and encouraging them to use it (as well as rewarding them when they do) is just as important as deterring them from the forbidden area. This goes for dogs as well as cats.The Scat Mat is a powerful and effective tool in your training arsenal, since it allows you to be consistent in keeping Fluffy and Fido out of areas where they are not supposed to be. Just remember that it is NOT a replacement for teaching your pet what is acceptable behavior -- its purpose is to teach them what is NOT acceptable. Teaching your pet what IS acceptable is still YOUR job.",dogs,3

It should not be used as a permanent cage for any bird. It has 4 good purposes. 1.) as a transport cage to the vet. 2.) A travel cage for a vacation. 3.)

"This litter helped my cat get back into the litter box reliably after a UTI. They both love it. I still remember the first time I dumped it into the LitterMaid (yes, it works great in there, and smells way better than the LitterMaid brand litter). They both rushed in to check it out even though they didn't need to use the box. I think the people complaining about clumping issues are trying to scoop waste that's either too fresh or too old or they have too much/too little litter in their box. Also, our cats will use their extra litter box on the 3rd floor when it's convenient, and that has a cheap litter in there. So if you have a main box and a secondary box, just using this in the main box may work for you as well.",cats,2
"I have an Australian Cattle Dog mix who is a year and a half old and a very heavy chewer. She DESTROYS most toys. I found this bone on sale at Target and decided to give it a try. She had the Nylabone puppy key teether and enjoyed those. I was surprised how hard this bone is - like a rock - but she LOVES LOVES LOVES it! It sounds awful while she chews it and I constantly worry that she's going to crack or break a tooth while chewing. I know it's supposed to help clean their teeth and gums, but I noticed that it ripped up the roof of her mouth pretty bad after a long chewing session - to the point where parts of the ridges on the top of her mouth were completely gone.I might try to see if I can find slightly softer bones of this nature for her to chew on - just for my own sanity. I'd hate to think she could damage her mouth or ruin her teeth on this toy. She gives this bone 5 stars, I give it 3 - so we're averaging a 4.",dogs,3

"I love this toy, and more importantly my dog does! I have two dogs and one is obsessed with this thing, the other is kind of ehh about it, but he will still play with it. My rott mix is a genious with this thing. He figured it out the second I gave this to him. He started rolling it around, but then he took it up a notch he picks it up and litteraly throws it on the ground with his mouth so it slams down hard. He figured out fast that this equals big pay off!! He has had this thing for probably a good 7 years and still going strong. It has been kept outdoors a majority of that time too. So even with the cold winters it takes a beating. I also have a doberman mix and he only seems interested if he can get instant payoff. But he will still play with it.One thing I have seen a lot is people commenting that this isn't for stong chewers, DUH! It's a PUZZLE/LEARNING toy!! It isn't meant to give to your dog to let them destoy it. My rott mix is an agressive chewer too, but he seems to know what is appropriate to chew and what is a ""fun"" toy. He rips off the arms, legs, and heads to all his stuffed animals along with destuffing them. He likes them when they are down to rags.

"I was a little nervous when I read some reviews other people wrote about their hamsters climbing out of the pen, but I figured that I would only put him in his pen when I wanted to watch him play and run around anyway so I would always be supervising him.

I put some things in the pen so he could crawl around, and his water bottle also attatched right to the pen, and I put treats and food in there. It's been about a month or so that I have owned this pen and he has not tried to escape. He loves it! It's great to give him more space when he is awake. He loves the freedom. The pen is very easy to put up and take down. It comes already assembled and as I mentioned, the wheel and water bottle I have for him attatches right to the pen making it easy to transport. I like to use the pen when I have to clean his cage also. A great buy. Definitely worth the money.

"Unfortunately my vet never stressed flea control for my indoor only cats. After suffering from a horrible infestation when my neighbors downstairs moved out, my problems only just started. Bombing with pesticides, traps, sprays, baths, vacuuming daily, and topical pesticides (Frontline & Advantage) all were ineffective at eliminating the problem. My Vet was at his wits end and I had been evicted from my home by this pestilence of biblical proportions. After six months of trying the aforementioned solutions, I came across Program. For one month I doubled down with Advantage and Program (as per the instructions in the Program package and as approved by my vet). After that month, the change was unbelievable. Now, I use only Program and trust it's protection completely. I love that there is no messy applicator, no needle, chemical smell, or nasty patch of pesticide on my cat's neck that gets on my furniture and prevents me from touching my cat for a couple of days. I would recommend this product to anyone with a house cat the wants simple and easy flea control.",cats,2

"I bought this to help train my 9 month old, 7 lb Cockapoo on a few issues that she was having some difficulties with and it has worked WONDERS! I've only had to actually use the ""shock"" setting a couple of times. Before I used that setting, I always gave her two warning beeps and said ""NO"" first. Now, all it takes is the warning beep or a firm, stern ""NO"" to make her behave. Thanks to this device, she no longer jumps on our neighbors when they come to visit, she no longer digs in the hamper and plays ""chase"" with our dirty clothes (I was running out of socks that didn't have holes, thanks to that ""game"") and she also keeps away from the doors when people are coming and going without running outside and playing keep-away (which was a big issue for me, since I live near a major highway). She now comes when I call her. The different settings are a godsend as well. My pooch never needs a setting higher than 2 (on a scale of 1-10) to get the point across. One thing I would recommend for ALL owners who buy this---USE IT ON YOURSELF FIRST! I know that sounds crazy, but I think that if you know personally how each setting feels (I myself couldn't go past 7) you won't get overzealous with turning that dial and you'll only put it on a setting that you, yourself are comfortable with. I highly recommend this for anyone who is having issues with training their dog. It definitely makes them start paying attention.",dogs,3

"my cat has had problems for almost a year now, and the vet was at the end of her recommendations other than an expensive trip to a university for a complete workup. in desperation, i tried feliway (i was pretty skeptical). within hours, i noticed that he had stopped pacing the house, and now (two weeks later) he has returned to very much like his old self. he's laying in the bed with me and my husband again, and is content to lay around the house, as any normal cat should do, instead of pacing back and forth from litterbox to litterbox.additionally, chase has addison's disease, and the calming effect has reduced his need for long-term steroids. i've been able to wean him off of them completely over the past two weeks. so now here i am, shopping for a refill! i paid $50 in the pet store for a plug-in and one bottle, and they sold the refills for $20, just to give you an idea of what this stuff costs in the ""real world."" i think i'll stick to buying it online. :)good luck with your kitties!",cats,2

Since I purchased it on line and threw away the shipping box, I have no idea how to deal with the manufacturer about a defective product.

"We recently got a new kitten (4 months old) who is always trying to drink water from anywhere BUT his water dish. He's always jumping up to drink out of the bathroom sink, or out of the bath tub, or if some water spills on the floor then he will lick that up too. Anyway, I wished that he was drinking more, but couldn't leave the faucet running all day.He seemed to be a good cat candidate for the drinkwell fountain system since he was into the running water. I bought the drinkwell and the instant that I plugged it in my cat was overjoyed. He was pawing at the stream of water and playing with it. He was drinking straight from the stream, he was drinking from the bowl. Now we have had the drinkwell for five days and he has drank more water than ever before. I had to refill the reservoir this morning because it was getting low! Its amazing, and my cat is no longer jumping into sinks and bath tubs because of it. Sometimes he just sits in front of the drinkwell and watches it like he's wishing he was more thirsty. I swear.I agree with all of the other positive reviews for this product. The sound of the water falling from the fountain is audible but not intrusive or annoying.A tip that I have found about the sound of the motor",cats,2

This makes it effectively useless. I don't know how the engineers on this didn't think to put some sort of guard in place to prevent this.Another problem is that the smallest feeding size is 1/4 a cup. The recommended amount of food for our cat is 1/2 cup per day, so we can only give her 2 feedings per day, not 3. Not a huge issue but not ideal.",cats,2

"This is a superb HOB filter. It moves a lot of water per hour at max and the filter media options are great! The normal 3 stage is very efficient. It has a flow adjustment feature that reduces the rate of intake while it increases filtration. This is great during feedings.HOBs aren't silent to begin with and if the sound of water flowing bothers you, you might want to find a hobby that doesn't involve water openly flowing... Water falling 5"" - 6"" is, wait for it... a waterfall! Water falling only 1/2"" is virtually silent, but many folks buy miniature fountains to get that same effect.The only reason for carbon dust to be ""escaping"" from the filter is that the carbon pouch wasn't rinsed well enough before it was inserted into the filter. Same goes for the ceramic media. If the filter isn't leveled properly, it will vibrate more than it should and be less efficient. If it doesn't fit your tank as designed, send it back. It's not the filter's fault that your tank won't work with it.If silent filtering is what you need, look at canisters not HOBs. This AC70 rules!",fish aquatic pets,4

"I had one of the earliest versions of this years ago. It worked okay, but the motor was weak and jammed easily. It was a nuisance to clean. When it broke within a year I didn't replace it, as my indoor cats had since found a way outside and quit using it.When I recently moved and was able to bring them back indoors (yay!) I saw LitterMaid had made improvements, surely significant ones, and decided to give it another go.Ha.Pros:* They have changed the way the rake tracks so that loose litter doesn't jam it any more.* They've increased the number of tries the rake makes before giving up. Good in theory.* They've made the rake easy to remove and clean.* They've added a function where you can tell it not to run for 10 hours, so you don't have to listen to it while you sleep.* The motor seems to be more powerful.* It's still a larger space so fits my 16 pound cat better than a standard box.Now the bads.* The depth of litter is still shallow, so the cat digs around more than in. This means they frequently make a nice little mountain when they're done. The rake can't get through, even with the extra tries, and it jams.* The shallow means that the urine clump has a lot of surface area to stick to the bottom of the box. The motor is not powerful enough to unstick it, and it jams.* It's still noisy. I can hear it two floors up (I have an open loft). But using the sleep timer means it's often jammed in the mornings from multiple uses during the night.* The idea of the little ramp to catch litter sounds good, but the fact is without a cover (which my cats don't like) there is a mess around the outside.* Taking it apart so you can wash the bottom is still bulky and messy.* You need to use fingernails to get the litter catcher out from under the flanges that seal the gap between the box and the catcher. Yuck. Otherwise, the rake can push clean, loose litter all the way up to the litter catcher, it falls through the gap and you get a pile on the floor underneath. I put a mat under there and just dump the clean litter back in. But I shouldn't have to do this.In other words, I have to manually clean the thing once or twice a day anyway. So much for convenient.I finally bought one of those deep boxes with the built-in sieve and trays that you alternate between, which make it very easy to clean. Tight space for my big boy, by my smaller cat finds is satisfactory and uses it, which means a little less frustration with the LitterMaid. And for about $15 at Target, a good value.I'm sorry I paid $100 to try an ""improved"" version. I wish it would break so I could give up on it without feeling guilty about having spent so much money. I wish I would have returned it while I could, but I hate to return bad products to Amazon when it's not their fault, and it was large and would have been bulky and expensive to mail back.I see that other negative reviews have popped up since I bought mine, and if I'd had those to read I would not have gotten it. When it breaks I'm going to get another sieve one and my big boy is just going to have to deal with it.Do not spend money on this. And if someone offers you there old one for free, think multiple times before investing time in trying it. You're welcome.",cats,2

"I have had my LitterMaid for about six months now with two cats. It didn't take the cats long at all to get used to the LitterMaid (even my skittish cat) and now they kind of enjoy watching the 'scoop' cycle. I liked my LitterMaid so much that I bought my mother one for mothers day (corny, yes, but she has ranted and raved about how wonderful it is).Mechanically I've found that it works very well as long as the following conditions are met:1. Don't let the litter go above or below the full/empty lines.2. Don't put the litter box somewhere that the humidity is too high or the clumping won't happen within 10min and the scoop will become clogged. I've found that anything above 55 or 60% humidity is too high.3. Use high quality scooping cat litter like the manual says. I use ExquisiCat without any problems. The cheaper litter will just lead to a lot of unnecessary cleaning of the scoop.As long as the above conditions are met I just clean out the bin about twice per week and replace all the litter about once a month (although I could probably go much longer without any problems). When I was in my apartment (and within earshot of the litter box) I followed the advise of a post and had the litter box on a timer while I slept to keep it from waking me up. I found that worked very well. As for the replacement containers, I have only used about three of them in six months, they hold up suprisingly well. Also, be careful that you don't put the container in backwards or it won't close fully, leading to unnecessary smells.",cats,2
"Shed-Solution for Dogs, 1 GallonWhat I thought I had ordered and what I got were two different things. I had been ordering and receiving the Shed-Stop which is a great product.

When the product came the picture on the front was brown so I assumed that they just changed the look but the product inside is very different. Once I realized that it was a different product I figured since this bottle said that it controlled shedding it would work the same boy was I wrong and my dogs made up for lost time in shedding. Apparently it does not taste the same either because my dogs do not furiously attack it like they did the Shed-Stop.

"I never would have considered this product except I met a woman at the dog park who uses this item. We have a great hound mix who has been very resistant to training. When he sees a cat, a bird or a rabbit he'll run at top speed for the animal. My wife has been pulled down on the ground while walking him on leash and he's pulled the leash out of my hands. I worried that he would break my hand; he's already sprained it. We're not small or weak either. He has a fierce interest in animals even if they are across main streets and I worry he'll break free and bolt, ending up hit by a car.After receiving this item the first thing I did was try it on myself, on my wrist. The sensation at a low level (15 to 20 in this case) which is what modern ecollar training suggests is like the kind of shock you get after walking across a carpet and then touching metal. It doesn't hurt or cause pain; it startles. It is possible I suppose to cause pain but I've never used a power setting higher than 20 (out of a possible 100) and usually 15 is high enough.I've only been using this for a few days and already our dog gets ""come"" and ""quiet"". The results are impressive. With this product he can play off leash at the dog park and be walked safely. When he sees an animal I hit the vibrate button (like vibrate on a cell phone) and that distracts him enough that he will keep going. Already he get excited when I put the ecollar on because he knows he's going out.If you do use this item do your research. There are some great websites out there. Lou Castle has a lot of good information on his web site. Make sure you use a low setting. Used carefully in educated hands this is a great tool.",dogs,3
This supplement is really good. I decided to use this product after a few friends recommended. So i decided to give it a try and its great. My dogs stool was a little soft and she became a little gassy but after a few days she was fine. Her fur looks great and she has more energy. Great supplement at a good price.,dogs,3
"The Lamb Jerky soft treats are the first product we tried from Zuke's. They were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle's favorite treats.Soft jerky squares (approx 1"") can easily be split into 3-4 pieces. We use them for her training/play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the Zuke's soft lamb jerky.Although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is theZuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats, Peanut Butter n' Blueberryzor the Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken n' Cherry.

"I bought this fountain in December 2010 for my two cats. We had a Petmate fountain but had issues with it and the cats just didn't really seem to like it...in fact, they seemed to prefer drinking out of the toilet to my utter embarrassment. After reading the positive reviews, I decided to splurge and buy the kitties this fountain for Christmas. They LOVE it! I know they are drinking more water which seems to have helped with digestive issues etc. It can be a bit noisy at times, seeming to maybe vibrate, possibly due to the ceramic tile. When I adjust it, it stops. I am considering getting a rubber mat for it to minimize that. The fountain holds a lot of water and the filters work really well. The water stays fresh for a very long time and I can just tell the kitties enjoy it. I highly recommend. Very much worth the price!",cats,2
"We have a Border Collie who has a love/hate relationship with skunks. She loves to surprise them, but hates it when she gets sprayed and then becomes an exclusively outdoor dog for several days because of the smell. ""Skunk Off"" works wonders. On the dry dog, saturate the fur with Skunk Off, concentrating on any areas that were a ""direct hit"". Massage liquid deeply into the fur, all the way to the skin if possible. Allow liquid to dry. Repeat if necessary (sometimes we've had to, other times, not). Works on carpet too (don't ask me how I know...dog doors are great inventions...sometimes!). We keep a bottle in the cupboard as ""insurance"" just for nights like this when the vet is closed and Amazon won't deliver till Tuesday.We HIGHLY recommend Skunk-Off. We also HIGHLY recommend an ""after-dark"" curfew if your dog loves skunks as much as ours does. Our dog is now grounded...she broke curfew and got caught.",cats,2

"After a ton of research I found this is the best premixed substrate for a planted tank. The only thing better is to make your own. I read the other reviews and I heard a lot about pre-rinsing. The package say you dont have to, but I did anyways. Evan after rinsing off the substrate I gently put it in my tank, used a bowl to fill the tank up so the water wouldnt disturbe the substrate and it was still cloudy. I let it sit for 2 days and it was still very murky. I went to the store and picked up some cheap water clarifier and within 30 minutes the tank was crystal clear.. The black dirt really makes the tanks colors pop and I hope it lives up to expectations for plant nutrients.. i give it 4.5 if I could only because of the cloudy water after I was told no need to pre-rinse..

"Purchased the medium ""Original Sherpa Delux"" with high hopes for flying with our 10 month old, 9 lb dog. On my second training run in the car I left the top flap open and my dog bit the open zipper track - which made the zipper inoperable. I shipped the carrier to Sherpa, figuring they would cut me some slack given the item was brand new and I was using it in good faith with a toy dog. I offered to upgrade to a better zipper, if available. Guess what? Not only did they not help me, they emailed me back requesting a Visa card # so they could charge me to ship the damaged item back. ""Satisfaction guaranteed"" is not part of their warranty. As an aside, there is no better zipper available from Sherpa...per the warranty customer representative I spoke with.",dogs,3
I was unsure if these were the correct items for our new litter box. But yes. The difference between the 200 and 300 series is the quantity in the box not the size of the container. Go figure.

"My bird & I are super happy with this cage. The price I purchased it at was $140 less than similar cages at pet stores. The quality is great for the price, it is well designed and nicely finished, the included bowls and perches are top quality. The seller shipped the product very quickly; the cage arrived well before the initially promised delivery date. It was very well packaged & protected for shipping and arrived undamaged despite UPS beating the heck out of the box. All parts were included, along with some spares, and there was even a small bottle of touch-up paint in the event any rubbing occurred during shipping. Assembly was straight forward and easy, although the directions were a little outdated (some screws shown were replaced with hex bolts instead). The only issue with the cage were the rubber balls on the casters. They were evidently recently produced and producing VERY strong-smelling fumes - not good for your birdie's delicate respiratory system. I set them aside to air out for the time being. A small & easy to fix issue on an overall great purchase. Highly recommend.",birds,0
The CatStop has been most effective in our garden for deterring cats from preying on the birds at our bird feeder. Moving the CatStop around seems to work at keeping not only cats away but also raccoons. From not having any quail to having 21 scratching on the ground around the feeder since we've had our 2 Ultrasonic Cat Deterrents is real proof that it works. I highly recommend this device for people who like to feed birds and live in a city where there are lots of cats wandering around hunting anything they can find.,cats,2

"I bought these thinking they were cheaper than the ""Soft Paws"" offered on [...]. They also have a CLS design on their site. Well.....I have a very docile 12 year old cat. She's been wearing the authentic Soft Paws from softpaws.com since I adopted her as a 1 year old. I have never had to have anyone hold her down to put the covers on. She's so laid back she's practically horizontal. Let me tell you, these covers from Amazon are NOT the same thing! Yes they have the CLS design, but the oblong shape to them as opposed to the actual curved claw shape of the authentic Soft Paws makes these covers extremely difficult to put on. I ordered one batch of Amazon covers and I just started using them. I went to replace 2 covers tonight and again got glue all over myself. I was trying to hold the opening to the claw cover open enough to slip it on her claw but she cried cause it wouldn't go on easy. Then the cover fell off and got stuck to her hair. I had to cut it out! Amazon does not give a very good view of the covers before purchase. It would be very easy to mistake them for the same shape as the more authentic covers. The price is attractive, but that's where it stops. They are not worth it. Save your money and order the REAL deal.",cats,2

"I agree with those who like the fountain. I use it for two cats, who used to bug me all day long to run water form the faucet. My large lab uses it, and two other large dogs sometimes use it, but I like them to use another regular water bowl because on of them does slobber in the water. I have used this constantly for several months now. My cats love it. I don't have to fill it as often as I would a large bowl of water. And my dog doesn't empty it as quickly either. I am glad I have it, but it has some problems. It is not as easy to clean as some have said. First of all it has a lot of corners that don't clean easy. I use a sharp wooden stick like those for cookies food on a spit to scrap the corners. Using a small scrubber does not do it. The filter was not that useful... I am doing well without any filter. But in the part where the filter was, there are a couple deep holes that are very difficult to get clean. The motor, is generally a real grind to get out for cleaning, which is why I don't clean it as often as I should. I don't find that the motor is noisy. It's rather quiet in fact. It just doesn't turn easily to get out. I use forks, spoons, knives, whatever I can find that will fit in the tight space where the motor is to turn it to get it out. My fingers or thumb just does not have the strength to move it. I didn't get it back quite right once and it leaked all over my floor and ruined some of the wood. I only used filtered water which comes from my Brita filter on my sink. So yes I like it because the animals like it. The only think I don't like is the cleaning part, which is more annoying than bothersome. I do stick it in the dishwasher now and then, but that doesn't get all the scum out; it still needs to be hand cleaned first.",dogs,3
I saw the good reviews on this and decided to pick this up at my local pet store. The product smells pretty good but it certainly doesn't stop itching.

"I have 3 cats and have a problem with them spraying even though all are female, and all are neutered. One is part Siamese, rather high strung, and a possible suspect! These plug in diffusers seems to keep them a calmer and minimize the problem with them spraying. It's not perfect - but I think it helps. I've also used the feliway spray which does seem to keep them from re-spraying on a particular site. For cleanup, especially walls - 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 water works the best. Only trouble with the diffusers is a tendency for them to be to heavy and to slowly work themselves out of the wall plug.",cats,2

"This is a perfect pet frame for a small dog or puppy for housetraining. You just push the corners of the pad into the frame.

I washed them several times hoping that they would stop shedding. My dogs always had fuzz on them and it was all over the house. After a few weeks of washing them thinking they would stop shedding, there were some bare spots. This was the worst product I ever bought. I was so disappointed in this product.

"I've never had a cat before. So I wasn't prepared when Felicia tripled in size at 3 months and started leaping squirrel-like from dresser to desk to the lamp next to the bed. Next, she'd be bouncing off the walls. I knew I just had to get her something for entertainment.Since I can't bear the thought of making the wrong purchase decision, I researched everything. This toy got some top ratings on Amazon, so it got my order. What a terrific little contraption it's turning out to be.From another room, I can hear the sound of the little ping-pong size ball rolling around the disc as Felicia swats it with her paw. It comes with a little pouch of catnip flakes, but I haven't used them; the cat is having such a blast without it. Why is this fun? Why does Felicia sit there batting it around and trying to catch it for 5 or 10 minutes at a time? What craving does this satisfy?Who cares. A month ago I would not have been able to type on the computer, as I'm doing now; Felicia would have been all over the keyboard, swatting at the screen, hurling herself compulsively around the room knocking over lamps and pencil cups. But today, the cat is a busy little bee. I can hear her in the kitchen attacking the pingpong ball. Because you cannot plunk your cat in front of the TV like you can a 2 year old, this totally works for me.",cats,2

"I have been using one of these for almost a year now. I had major issues with good flow within areas of the tank, this would of course cause buildup of detritus and creat dead flow areas and all of the issues that come with that. One solution was to try a small circ pump but that turned out to be far to big for the tank, even the smallest one i could find, and was to strong for the corals and fish.This little device does a nice job creating alternation in the waterflow from the feed pump. It does stop spinning from time to time but I have found that a quick rinse out generaly will do the trick to unclog the cog inside. It requires regular maint. Take it off with your weekly water change, pop the houseing off (this is done easily by pushing on the white tab in the front of the device, rinse out the gears and put it back in place.All in all, yes it takes a little bit of attention to maintain but well worth it.",fish aquatic pets,4

"My aging cat, like many others, needs to be encouraged to drink as much as possible. I read lots of reviews for cat fountains, and decided on this one (there are basically two other options that I know about.)I have a pergo floor that isn't impervious to water, so I varnished a thin 2'x2' piece of plywood to set the fountain on, to catch any random splashes.Maisie wasn't sure about the thing at first, though maybe the smell of the varnish was putting her off. After a few days she has taken to it fine. I don't know if she LOVEs it, as other owners have claimed, but she does use it, which is all I could reasonably expect.Good:- It is quiet. The motor is virtually inaudible. I don't know why some other people complain about the humming or buzzing noise. I don't hear a thing, and mine is sitting on a hard floor (on top of a sheet of 1/16"" plywood.) It can make a trickling watery sound at the high setting, but apparently some people like the sound, and anyway turning down the flow almost eliminates it.- It holds a fair amount of water. I don't have to worry about it going dry every few days as I did with the old water bowl. So Maisie always has water to drink.- Doesn't splash water everywhere. In fact it doesn't splash at all. The water has a landing ramp that lets it down easy.- Stable, not easy to tip over.Not so good:- It does need to be refilled every few days, not because it will run out of water, but because the impeller pump sits a fair distance above the bottom of the drinking bowl, so there has to be a fair amount of water in the bowl so the impeller (like a little paddle wheel) isn't spinning in air. The pump will complain then, making a sucking, thrumming sound. If the water level falls too low, the pump will run dry and possibly burn out, even if there is still water in the bowl.- It isn't that easy to clean. I clean mine every week or so, which seems to be often enough. It doesn't take me 30 minutes as it does another reviewer, more like 10. I don't have the problem with cat hair (I brush Maisie twice a day) but I do get a bit of brown or pink slime (just as I did with an ordinary water bowl.) That is anaerobic bacteria, just like you get on the lower edge of your shower curtain, and it isn't dangerous to your cat. But it is icky.The fountain was designed with absolutely no thought to making it easy to clean. There are several nooks and crannies that are hard to reach and would have been easy to eliminate. For example, in the water reservoir there is a deep, round cavity about 1/2"" in diameter and about 4"" deep, closed at the bottom. It serves no purpose other than to align the reservoir assembly with the base, and it is continuously filled with water. To clean it well requires something like a test tube brush (long thin round brush with bristles on the end.)So instead of cleaning it with a brush, I am experimenting with simply rinsing it with white vinegar, which should kill most of the bacteria, and unlike dishwasher detergent or spray cleaners, it leaves no residue and especially, no odor (once it is rinsed away.)Or I may just use the dishwasher. The fountain is top-shelf safe, but a different plastic would have made it anywhere-safe. Also, it would be hard to position it so that it won't collect dishwasher water (with little bits of coffe grounds, etc.) somewhere inside.For those reasons, I give it four stars. The water filter is nice by the way, but it is quite thin and I don't know that it does very much. Nor do I know if it is really necessary. It is supposed to remove tastes and odors, but there wouldn't be much in tap water, and Maisie certainly doesn't mind when she drinks from the faucet. Also, it filters water that has already passed through the pump. It would have made more sense to put a screen or filter in the water flow in front of the pump where it can keep hair out of the impeller.",cats,2
"This was the best battery-powered air pump I could find and it works well for traveling, which is why I bought it. But it is very loud and moves almost violently. For some reason the one I have will only work with the battery power. The electric cord just won't work. Again, I'll stress how loud it is. I would only recommend it because of the price and it works for traveling in a car if you wrap it in towels to smother the noise.",fish aquatic pets,4
I want to put a plug in for ScoopFree. I have used this box for approximately 4 years. When I moved t bought a new ScoopFeee. They have amde the motor sound like a mere whisper. Both of my boxes work perfectly. My cats have always used it with no problems. Maybe you spend more on the litter trays. But each time you changed litter you have a new clean tray to hold the litter. This machine holds up. It is definitely the best on the market in my opinion. scoopFree will deliver your litter trays on a regular schedule and their people are super nice to order from.,cats,2
"The price was right for me, which is why I went with this cage. I have two parakeets that have plenty of room for themselves, a few toys, and a nesting box(in addition to the food/water). My only real complaints are1) The base is only supported by the droppings tray. So you have to support the cage to remove the tray, and it sags while it's out being cleaned.2) A few of the hooks for the doors and frame were open, so was not staying connected. I had to take plyers to close them tighter to hold in place.Beyond this, the cage has been great for my needs. Now I just need a bigger base to set it on.",birds,0

"We had priviously had the old fountain, so this was an upgrade for us. Our two cats seem to really enjoy it. The reservoir is larger, but only slight bad feature is it is a bit more difficult to position....I always seem to drip more water with this new reservoir.....but once it is in place, it is great!! LOVE the new feature that regular water may be used. Saves lots on bottled water I used to use. The addition of the new filter is the reason reg. water may be used. We notice our cats almost always ""play"" in the water as they are drinking...but drink plenty, and that is the idea!! LOVE this fountain!! It was a one-stop procedure to order from Amazon and was quickly and efficiently shipped to me....GOOD service!",cats,2
"Both of my cats love to get on my bed and burrow under the covers, and they love to curl up in their own beds, so I figured this was a no-brainer. A bed and a snuggle-under-the-covers all in one!Unfortunately, my cats did not agree. They sniffed around it and walked away. I left it in various spots for a couple of months and they just were not interested. The only time one of them got in it was when I sprinkled some catnip inside - but once that was gone it was ignored again.I really have no idea why they rejected this delightful snuggly bed, but since they ARE cats there is no point in trying to figure it out. I gave it to my daughter-in-law who said her cat loves it.",dogs,3

"So my cat likes when I use this on him (which is surprising) but my only issue is that I have to brush his fur backwards to really get the fur loose enough to where it will stick to the brush. Just brushing the cat like I pet him doesn't create enough ""pull"" on the fur to do much. Once you get the fur worked up and loose, the brush traps it all fairly nice and makes for easy cleanup. I wish the ""teeth"" were closer together so it would create more pull, but I can't complain too much considering how much I paid for it. I will use it every now and again, but I will keep looking.EDIT",cats,2

They also seemed to have learned that it is not okay the spray the house since they have not done it anywhere else either.,cats,2

"Up until recently, I had been using his food exclusively, but after several disturbing incidents I have switched brands. In the last few months have found cardboard, hair, and a bug in three separate varieties of Merrick dog and cat food. When I found the cardboard, I contacted the company with my findings and they apologized and mailed me a coupon. Since then, I have found hair in two varieties of dog food and the final straw last week was opening a can of cat food to find a dead fly right on the top of the food. There is no way that this food is being produced in a human facility. The quality is appalling -- especially at these prices.

It assembles easily, is sturdy, the door swings both ways without a problem, and so far has not pinched my dog (as a metal cage sometimes can). Please note, however, that my dog is NOT a chewer - a determined dog could chew through this crate, but then any determined dog can escape ANY crate. I am so pleased with this one that I may order another for the living room (my dog likes crates). With the addition of a sturdy top, it would make a nice end table.",dogs,3

"My German Shepherd used to go completely berzerk in the car if she saw another dog on the street, or a rabbit, or a jogger, or a school bus, or a bicycle, or a .... you get the idea. She's a tad high strung. In the last few months, her influence on my German pointer was such that taking them anywhere was potentially an earsplitting nightmare, garnering angry looks from others and a very unpleasant experience for me. The calming cap, in one fell swoop, changed all of that. I expect motorcycles will still be a problem, but she truly sits quietly now as we blissfully travel along in SILENCE. Unbelievable! I've tried a zillion different things, but this actually worked, painlessly, and does not require me to have 10 arms, lightening quick reflexes or the patience of Job. i put on the cap, we go take a ride. That's it. HEAVEN ON EARTH. Thank you to the Marin, CA Humane Society worker whose brainstorm this was. My relationship with my dogs, and their ability to go places, has been restored.",dogs,3
"It took my cats about 5 minutes to figure out how to ""cheat"" the timer on this feeder. They can just stick their paws into the tube where the food comes out, and get food whenever they want.

"We have tried the ScoopFree LB2 Ultra Self-Cleaning Litter Box with limited success. The cartridges just don't last very long as our cat drinks a lot and the urine is just not absorbed well enough by the pearl cat litter making this unit very costly to operate.The Litter Robot II keeps the litter very clean and because it uses regular clumping clay litter, it's extremely cheap to operate (we just add a few cups of litter every couple days). In fact it's so clean, that my other cat has started using it and she's extremely picky. So we've actually purchased a second Litter Robot for her! LR sells a guard for the lip which helps prevent the litter from being flung out the front of the unit which I highly recommend if your cat ends up shooting litter out the front like our girl kitty does. Other than the litter flinging, the unit has performed as described. It's not really noisier than the ScoopFree automated litter box. And the litter flinging out the front is more a product of our cat's behavior than anything else (one's a flinger, the other one isn't).I did have to adjust the sensor on the front to make it less sensitive, which wasn't a problem because both our cats are over 10 lbs, so they trip the self cleaning pressure switch quite easily. It's a lot taller than our last litter box, but sticks out much less which actually makes it more convenient for the location we have it in.As I've mentioned, the cats love it so much that we bought a second unit. It is easy to clean and we simply use the same 14 gal. trash bags that we use for our kitchen receptical, so no special bags to buy. One could use 8 gal. bags as well.",cats,2
"I normally do not write reviews, but this item is so much more than I expected! I have a large lab so scooping is a daily chore.

Within a couple of months on Vibrant Pets she looked like a new dog. Her fur was growing in like crazy, the allergies lessened and even her eyes were clearer. We have three Shelties and they take Vibrant Pets every day. One of our girls with a sensitive stomach doesn't have problems anymore. The money saved in vet bills is well worth the price of this product. In addition, the 48 oz container lasts us several months, even with three dogs having it twice per day.",dogs,3

"My barn cat ""Miss Kitty"" is quite the hunter, and was leaving partially devoured carcasses on the front porch of my next door neighbor. They were mostly quail remains, but included everything from mice to ground squirrels, to cotton tails. I therefore had a mess to clean up about every other day. We tried other deterrents, at considerable cost, to no avail. I received my Contech StayAway Motion-Activated Pet Deterrent promptly through Amazon.com. It was easy to assemble and worked like a charm. I started with the setting for both alarm and air spray for a couple of days, then switched to alarm only to conserve the compressed air. My neighbor hasn't had a single incident since in several weeks.Contech StayAway Motion-Activated Pet Deterrent",cats,2
"Out of desperation, I purchased both this Vet*Best Travel Calm and Pet Naturals Calming chews. I tried the PN product first and found it amazingly effective (separate review). I did not expect the VB to match the performance of the PN product but was happily surprised. I would judge their effectiveness to be about equal. All four of our pets accept VB without any trickery or disguise and the calming effect lasts equally long (at least 8 hours). The flavor/aroma of PN, however, is much stronger and our pets can go bonkers if they detect it ahead of being served. Strangely, the PN flavor/aroma gets muted when mixed in food (even dry nibbles) or water or when chilled. I had hoped to use the PN (especially the liquid formula) as a flavor enhancer for one of our pets who is losing her appetite prematurely. I am still looking for a super-good flavor enhancer or appetite booster. (UPDATE",dogs,3

"I read all of the reviews and this product sounded great, but my dog (100% mutt) has short/medium, wiry hair so I was skeptical... I had tried lots of other brushes on her, including a plain old men's comb. The other brushes just seemed to rearrange her hair, but they never pulled anything out. But if I wore a pair of black tights, you can bet their were little blond doggie hairs on them as soon as I got anywhere near her. The house was full of fur...Anyway, I bought this brush and it pulled HANDFULS of fur off of her. She didn't mind at all, so it must not hurt. I'm not sure how it worked, but it worked!",cats,2
"My cats shed quite a lot, and one of them bathes both so he ends up with hairball issues. Not any more! I've used one of these brushes before and they're fantastic at thinning out the undercoat and making my cats look and feel better. They're always so much happier after a good coat-thinning, especially here in southern California in the summer months. I typcally brush them every other week or so and usually get enough to fill a shoebox! They squirm at first but after a few strokes they settle in and relax while I brush them for 10-15 minutes. They're happy, I'm happy, and they're healthier as a result. Best of all, it cost me less than $10 instead of the almost $50 they go for at retail.",cats,2

We love frontline plus! Our dog had a bad case of fleas d/t our move out to WA. We are renting a place that was seriously infested. She is slowly improving. The vet suggested that we apply it every 2 weeks until the problem is resolved and to keep her out of the water eventhough it states that it is waterproof. The vet also suggested that we avoid toughing her because it interfers with the action of the product. All of this info helped us and maybe can help others with a flea problem. This was the best deal we found!,dogs,3
"I got this to keep the cats out of the bedroom. The good is that it has both an alarm and spray. You can choose between alarm only or alarm and spray. The bad is that it only works sometimes, which has one of my cats still trying to get into the bedroom. I've tried changing the batteries to lithium and the sensor still only works intermittedly. At night I've tried leaving the light on in the hallway, which means I still have to close the door which defeats the purpose. If the sensor was able to detect the cat's on a more consistent basis, I would highly recommend this product. As it only works sometimes it hasn't done much to keep the cats out.",cats,2

I bought this for my girlfriend's cat to try to get it used to a scratching post. Her cat could care less about the catnip. I placed the whole tin near him and he just ignored it after briefly sniffing at it. Oh well. I wound up giving the catnip to another friend and her cat went completely bonkers when it smelled the catnip. If you buy this it might or might not work. Still it seems like plenty of catnip for the price and I'm ultimately happy with it since it worked out fine for my friend's cat.,cats,2

She has had fun pulling the little squirrels out but I don't expect her to be able to play with it longer than maybe another hour or two (and again, under supervision).

This stuff is great. I don't consider it a treatment as in only use when your fish is infected. I use this more as a preventive. Meaning I use this all of the time with my fish. Granted I usually keep Cichlid fish that are more hardy than most fish. I feed my fish lots of live food so keeping my fish free from parasites is a must. Coppersafe is pretty safe on fish that aren't sensitive or delicate. Yes if your water supply is heavy on copper you do need to watch out. The below user who rated this at 2 stars may live in an area where his local water supply is polluted with copper. I usually use 75% of the recommended dose as to keep from overdosing. Testing your water for copper is recommend wether or not your using Copper Safe.

"I think this may be a great product, and is why I bought it. However, mine NEVER worked (and hence was never actually used, it was just taken out of the box!)The remote would beep the collar but not spray. Seller did have manufacturer send new batteries (which further delayed my getting a good response to this situation). New batteries arrived, item still didn't spray, but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer, to get a replacement, even though I responded within their advertised 30 day return policy. Please read seller information and return policies CAREFULLY! Even if you get them to take something back (only if never opened...if opened and doesn't work, they toss you to the manufacturer), there is a 25% RESTOCKING FEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pretty exorbitant and not Amazon type service I have come to expect over many years of buying from Amazon! Be very careful of sellers that are not Amazon...sometimes it isn't very clear it is not Amazon. My feedback on Seller is on feedback page and seller responded, but I don't get a chance to respond to their feedback, which gives the misconception that I actually used this product! I couldn't have used it as it didn't work! If you want to buy this, I'd recommend a reputable pet store such as Pet Smart where you can easily take an item back if it doesn't work and get a refund. Even if they are willing to replace something, you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two and would want a refund, which most stores have no problem with doing for you. Next time I go the established pet stores.",dogs,3
The sport dog field trainer has been a great tool for continued training for our 2.5 year old Weimaraner Gunnar. I definitely recommend this product for anyone with a Sporting Breed that wants to take training to the next level.,dogs,3

"I have two kittens (brother and sister), and I tried this food because of the excellent quality. The boy kitten can not tolerate this food--it gives him diarrhea badly. It took me forever to figure out that it was this food. The other kitten does very well with it. And they both seem to love it. Instead, I give the intolerant kitten a simple duck or venison and pea formula from Natural Balance and this has helped A LOT. Plus, that is cheaper as well.",cats,2

"I bought two of these medium pet carriers 20 months ago for two cats, one is 10 lbs, one is 13.5 lbs. I just bought another one for a 11.5 lb stray cat who adopted me. The top door is great for putting cats in carriers who do not want to be in carriers. I have pet beds inside, unfortunately, finding beds/pads made for this size is not easy. The 13.5 cat tried to bust out of the carrier, making it necessary to secure the carrier with zip ties so that the carrier didn't come apart. I also covered the carrier handles with bicycle handle tape to make them more comfortable to carry. They are the perfect size for each of the cats. With the zip ties and handle bar tape, they are sturdy and ideal for transporting pets. They make trips to vet tolerable for me and the cats.",dogs,3
"Even in northern Florida, winter nights can get cold. The first winter after we took in a six-month old feral kitten, it was like having a baby. She wouldn't hear of staying inside, but with temperatures sometimes in the 30s, 20s or even teens, we had to wake ourselves up repeatedly to let her back in so she didn't freeze. When the second winter rolled around, I had vowed to find a better way that let her humans get some sleep. Google led me to the Snuggle Safe and Tick 'n Thistle's outdoor cat bungalow, and winters now are no problem. After a few minutes in the microwave, we pop the Snuggle Safe into her little house, and she is set for the night anytime she doesn't want to sleep inside the big house. I've also recommended the Snuggle Safe to several friends who care for outdoor cats, and they tell me their cats would send thank-you notes if they could write.",cats,2

"When I got home from work today I opened the box and the jar had no seal on it, and there was no scoop inside the jar. I would have had to ship it back today to get a replacement and UPS was already closed (I work until 9pm) so I just opted for a refund. Im not sure why Amazon insisted that I return the item the same day it arrived. Since the product wasn't sealed, I don't want to give it to my pets - plus the dosing instructions are by scoop, and without a scoop I have no idea how much to give anyway.",dogs,3
"The pouch works great and keeps you from having a pocket full of crumbs from carrying treats in your jacket pocket. It's got a hinged top which you can open or close with one hand. We wore out our old one and ordered two of these, one for each human in the family. It's got a better design now - the front pocket can now hold even a bulky cell phone and the back zippered pocket is bigger as well. I like that it holds everything I need since many womens' clothes don't have pockets. You can carry treats, phone, tissues, key and cash in the pouch.",dogs,3
"I got this for my 22 lb shih tzu who is pretty good at figuring things out. He is totally disinterested in this toy (which I bought at retail for $20). He doesn't find the treat at all appealing and because the flaps seem rather stiff, his kibble doesn't come out. He has a cube that I fill with kibble that he rolls all over the house and he just loves that--but this doesn't do it for him.$20 would have paid for a lot of treats!!",dogs,3

They're not the hardiest of toys, and my dogs destroyed 2 of them right away, but they loved the 2 squeakers and seem very attached to the remaining toys even now.

"First let me say that I bought my Panic Mouse at PetSmart not Amazon but it's the same toy. I'm giving Panic Mouse 3 stars because my cat would give it 5 stars for fun but I only give it 1 star for durability. The problem, which I discovered after taking it apart when it would no longer work properly, is that the internal mechanism is made of cheap plastic gears. If your cat does anything to really tug on the ""mouse"", the gears become damaged. I did buy a second one but this time I made the end of the wand attachment a little bigger so that it comes off when Diz tries to take his prize with him. He also only gets to use it if I'm busy around the house and don't have time to play with him with his favorite toy that costs about $3 to make. Get a 4 foot, 1/4 inch diameter wood dowel, thin black cord elastic and a cheap feather duster. Tie about a 5-6 foot length of the elastic around one end of the dowel and secure it with duct tape and then tape a few feathers to the other end. Since you have the whole duster to get feathers from you can replace them as needed without further cost. Life is short, play with your pets.",cats,2
"I have 2 siamese cats of different ages. The male, younger cat (7yo) can be aggressive towards the older female (13 yo). I tried everything to make him less aggressive towards her but nothing worked like Feliway plug ins. I LOVE this product and it totally works for my 2 cats. They are both very content when I use it. I can even tell when the plug in runs dry as their bad behavior starts up again. Definitely recommend it. As an FYI - 1 plug in will not work for the whole house. I have one in a large den where they spend most of their time playing, sleeping and hanging out with us. Another in the kitchen (adjacent to den) where their food is. These 2 are enough for calming the cats.",cats,2
"We bought this for our dogs to stay in our large back yard without a fence. They are older dogs, and were starting to wander into the neighbours' yard. The product worked okay, but must really be followed exactly. WE have about an acre of land, and it is a complete pain in the ass to bury the wire. You have to dig up a small trench all around the area you'd like to set up as the boundary. Then, you end the wire at a power source. We ran ours in through a basement window. We tried to take a short cut with the training aspects by leaving the flags up and hoping the dogs got the idea that if you get close enough to the flags, you get zapped. They didnt. My one poor dog thought the grass was getting him. He peed off the deck for a week! We ended up waiting a while so things could go back to normal, and then we'd train them properly. My boyfriend ended up hitting the window wire accidently with the weed whacker, and we never got around to digging up the wire to splice it and repair it.The actual product worked well and gives all the information one needs to set up their yard and dogs properly. It just takes a lot of work, and we were obviously too lazy.",dogs,3

We also have a cord chewing problem...We save money on litter. We clean our litter box everyday, making sure that it doesn't get too disgusting and gross. Because of this, we are able to not have to change the entirety of the little box out as often as we used to. The inside of the box stays clean longer, and saves us yet even more time.We have two cats. They both use this box. Yes, I know we need more than one box, but I am not joking when I say that this is the only box they use now (Haven't had to clean the other box in a month, and I have checked it for buried treasure!).We have had this box now for a few months, and after doing some math, it is paid for itself back by 50% (Paid $50 for the litter box in full and shipped, have saved approx. $25 in litter cost).As long as you can lift 5 pounds, you can clean this box.

"This ""Improved"" Filter is a BIG loser! If you have a power failure it will not consistantly restart! I bought 5 Penguin 150's and 4 are in service. When power fails sometimes one will not restart, and one time none of the four would restart! I turn them off to feed the fish and 95% of the time one or more of them will NOT restart. I have to pour a little water into the impeller area to get a prime going. Think about when you go on vacation and you have a power failure just after you depart. Dead fish!This is a failure of engineering and failure of quality control.When I called the United Pet Group (the owners of MarineLand)I got a runaround. They asked if I had sand in it, If I had cleaned it, if I had an air leak in the intake tube (all four of them new?!) and a bunch of questions to NOT answer the question of what is wrong with this ""New"" series of Penguin Filters. You better believe they know what the problem is and why it is a problem but it will be to expensive to recall all the filters out there. So us suckers will buy a failed product.

No more chewed through strings close to the toy.",cats,2

Nobody wanted to use the stimulation collar as they wanted something ""more humane"". I have to say that one time with this collar really did the trick.

This product was a lifesaver in my home.",dogs,3
"I had a previous fountain that was significantly smaller. I had to get rid of it due to it being impossible to clean.While I only have 1 indoor cat and no outdoor ones, this fountain did solve a lot of my problems with the previous one. Allow me to explain.This fountain comes apart in pieces easily so it can be cleaned. It also has a little gate that catches cat hair and other stuff from getting recirculated with the rest of the water. It also runs practically silent.What I will say is for new owners, once you plug it in and are setting up, give it a solid hour to get the water running through the system before you expect it to be quiet. My initial tiff with this thing was that it wasn't quiet when it started working. About an hour later, it was so silent I could barely hear it.I have owned this a week and so far, no complaints short of the spare filters being slightly over priced.What I will say is to make sure you take it apart and clean it out once a week. If you do this, this fountain should last you as long as the motor does, which should be a few years.***************Update 7/10/12I continue to use this fountain and enjoy it. As long as you take it apart and clean it every 2-weeks or so, it functions flawlessly. The pump still works fine as well.The only annoyance is cleaning the tube shaft the fountain pulls the water through from the base. For this I use a scrubber intended for a baby bottle, aka a baby bottle brush.At this point, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this item to anyone who has a picky cat who wants to drink from a running water source. I had a cheap fountain before this one and it failed on me. This one is still working and outside of the one cleaning irk, it is worth its weight in gold.",cats,2
"Maggie will be 15 years old in June, and had taken to peeing on the carpet during the night at least once a week. I got really tired of carpet-cleaning, and one night she slept right next to our bed - when she got up, the wet spot was spread out, so I thought she had leaked without even getting up. We tried different things that worked for awhile, like pulling her water before 7 pm and encouraging her to wake me up to go outside - but the latter was too much torture for me. So I ordered these pants, and took the advice about using Poise pads for humans in them. I went to Rite-Aid, where I never shop, lest someone think the pads were for me. LOL. Anyway, they had both Poise pads and their own cheaper brand version of them. I asked myself if Maggie would care if I didn't get the brand name, and decided she wouldn't. They fit perfectly in the garment, and the pants fit the dog perfectly. She weighs around 35 pounds and there was only one size to choose from, Medium. We thought she might chew the pants off or be uncomfortable, but she just walked funny for about 3 minutes and then was perfectly happy. She gnaws on her leg or toenails, but leaves the pants alone. She has no problem moving or curling up in her bed. The pants are easy to get on by putting the tail in the hole first. The straps come up in front of the back legs on the belly, and they velcro on to the top on her back end. She has not peed in the pants, so I can't say how that would be, but I am thrilled that I don't have to clean the carpet. She's been wearing them every night for a couple of weeks. We still pull the water by 7:30 pm, but if we should forget, we are safe. I intend to order another pair when they are back in stock. They are a genius invention and also look pretty cool. :)",dogs,3
"I have been using the Gentle Leader head collar for about a month now and it has greatly improved the quality of our walks over both a standard collar and even the easy walk harness.We adopted an adult dog who is leash reactive around larger dogs. He lunges and growls agressively, and being about 50lbs of muscle, can be difficult to handle for my wife. A standard collar was ruled out immediately, and at first we tried the easy walk harness. The harness did stop him from pulling/leading while on the walk, however it did nothing to prevent the lunging and aggressive behavior. I tried some of the techniques in Feisty Fido to little or no avail. It got to the point that we adjusted our walks to avoid other dogs as much as possible, making it much less enjoyable.When we tried the gentle leader collar, within about two days, the lunging had almost completely stopped and my wife no longer had any trouble keeping him under control on a walk around other dogs.There are two small negatives that I have found with this product:1. I have to re-tighten the collar at almost every walk as it loosens up slightly each time.2. It takes a while for the dog to get used to the collar (though this is mentioned in the product information). Even after a month of use, the collar still makes our dogs neck and cheeks very itchy - and he still tries to rub and scratch his face at any opportunity.Overall, this is a great product, and we are very happy with the purchase and subsequent results.",dogs,3
"I now have 3 cats, thanks to finding a 4 week old flee infested kitten stumbling around in our yard a few months back. Things were great with just 2 cats. But, with 3 cats, the litter box was just getting out of control. Cleaning it by hand, 3-4 times a day was getting to be too much. I saw this brilliant looking box and thought I'd give it a try. I was skeptical, but thought at least I could use it as a very large box, by taking the screen out, if it didn't work. But, I'm just floored. This thing really works...and it works well. I'm not sure what problems anyone can be having with it, except maybe they put the screen in backwards, or they aren't using finely grained, clumping litter, which is usually much less expensive. Anyway, I don't normally write reviews on products that I buy, unless they just work amazingly well. I wasn't expecting much, the first time I rolled this thing over...but my jaw just dropped when I pulled the pan out, and all the dirty litter was right there, waiting to be dumped. This thing has made my life alot better around here. The house doesn't stink up whenever the cats use the box, thanks to the cover. I don't get litter dust in my sinuses anymore, from manually cleaning the box....I hated that. Litter doesn't get flung all over the place as badly anymore, by the cats.That's about all I have to say about this box. It's a life saver.",cats,2

They hold up well in the fridge, and are fairly easy to put on and take off. The only thing that threw me at first was the double rim on them, where the outer rim lies down and out from the can. The reason they are built like this is because it allows both large and small cans to be sealed. Once I got used to it, they seem normal. Again, it could be because I am used to the older platic ones that ""snapped"" on. I like these much better. Great design.",cats,2

"I fell in love with this dog house when I saw it. It is beautiful! But...1. One of the steps arrived with a crack across it.2. It was very leaky and I had to caulk it. Lots of gaps for wind and rain to seep through!3. When the temps dipped low, factory glue started to expand and leak out from the lattice work and other areas.4. Poor construction (mostly glue and staples, other than the screws they give you for the final assembly).5. The cedar slats are thin and not very durable overall.This just won't work for the stray cat that has adopted us and remains outdoors. I wanted something that would protect her from the Upper Midwest winters (I also purchased an outdoor heated bed which I LOVE); but this is NOT it.Amazon has been gracious about taking it back, although I'm disappointed that a CSR told me that UPS would pick it up from my door assembled, as long as I provided them with my return slip. I should have known that UPS wouldn't take it. Now I have to break it back down, try to get it to fit back in the box (good thing I kept it!) and see if they'll accept it tomorrow.I'm buying the Petmate Indigo dog house instead.

"My 11.2 pound chihuahua/terrier mix LOVES the 3.5 inch version of this ball! She has a small mouth with a jaw that doesn't open very wide, so solid, round balls were difficult for her to hold. She loves this one because she can just clamp her teeth down on a little piece of it and hold it firmly in her mouth. She also loves how well it bounces and often plays with it on her own by throwing it in the air herself. When I throw it for her and she brings it back to me she also likes to play tug of war with it before letting go. It has survived all our tug of warring with no problems. This ball collapses so I can stuff it in my pocket when we go to the dog park. My dog is not a chewer so we haven't had any problems on that end, but once a Welsh Terrier at the dog park ""stole"" this ball from her and had chewed it to pieces in about three minutes.

We go through about one bottle a month, so we order it at the same time as our filters, and they come together with our Amazon Prime free 2-day shipping.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Filter floss seems to be more effective than standard foam, so I bought this bag. Only complaint is that I wish it used ziptie design as the strings are a bit of a pain to tie. MADE IN CHINA",fish aquatic pets,4
"I think this is one of those devices you have to be crafty with. Let's be honest, cats will figure out how to beat this thing if they can. I tried this in several different areas of my kitchen because I wanted to keep my cats off the counter. Don't get me wrong, they are afraid of it...when it works! The sensor takes a second to register and by the time it does the cat has already eaten whatever it came to feast on! My kitty Logan has now gotten to the point where he does make a scrunched up face at the product and runs away when I point it at him but that defeats the purpose. The sensor doesn't seem to cover a wide area either. So you have to be crafty with placement. It isn't one of those products you can just place on your counter and it will work without any effort or thought. The spray always seems to go off at the wrong time as well. It smells odd and often times I find myself saying I spent 50 bucks on a can of spray! When the battery starts to deplete it's even worse! I wouldn't buy this product for the price it is now. Maybe if it were 20 or 15 it may be worth it. Then you could maybe get a couple and come up with a better plan of attack so to speak lol. But for a poor college student 50 bucks is a little bit much for a defective can of spray.",cats,2

"I recently moved from Cambridge, MA, to the Seattle area, Washington State. I drove here -- with two cats (they have heart problems, and can't fly). It took eight days.I needed a serious litter solution.These made my life so much easier. I bought a single bag of Nature's Miracle litter (great stuff, btw) and 9 WonderBoxes, then dispensed a bit of litter into one each night, tucking it into a kitchen-sized garbage bag in the morning before I left (and leaving a tip for the maid, of course!). The cats were happy to have fresh litter, I was happy not to have used litter in the car.I don't know how well they'd hold up for more extended use, though they are quite sturdy. My maine coons have claws, and did a pretty good job of shredding the edges of these even over the course of one night. They didn't come remotely close to compromising the structural integrity of the box, but if used for a longer period of time, they probably could.",cats,2
"The other reviews have talked about how great this toy held up, but my dog made pretty quick work of this. Granted my dog absolutely loved it, but was a little disappointed with how long it lasted. My dog is a great dane, and anyone who knows the breed knows how laid back they actually are, his activity level is very low and this just simply didn't hold up.",dogs,3
"This is an excellent product to have around the house and on walks. I am buying a spare can today because it just saved the life of a squirrel that wasn't able to run away from my dog in time. My dog had caught the squirrel and I grabbed the can, shaking it as I ran out the back door. I sprayed my dog in the face and grabbed her collar - she dropped the squirrel who quickly ran off up a nearby tree - with a few pieces of tail fur missing - but alive. I then proceeded to wash off my dog's head with cool water and towel her dry. She's none the worse for wear and hopefully the squirrel is alright too. You never know when you'll need it and it's great to have around.",dogs,3
"These are wonderful dog frisbees, durable and easy to throw and easy on their mouths. Only one problem with ordering online through Amazon - you cannot pick the color. All four of mine came in purple, which is the hardest to spot when the dog drops it in the creek or on the grass. Prefer yellow, no way to tell the seller that . . .",dogs,3

"I have 3 cats, currently aged 11, 7 and 8 months. Innova cat & kitten food takes care of all three with canned food that is high in protein, lower in fat and carbs, and has a taste all 3 cats love. I do not buy from Amazon as I've found a better deal from a website that starts with C and sounds like the nickname for Chewbaca. I've compared this toWellness Grain-Free Canned Cat Food, CORE Chicken/Turkey/Chicken Liver Recipe, 24-Pack of 5-1/2-Ounce Cans(which I still have in rotation once in a while), and the stats were almost identical. Personally I think Wellness smells a little better to me, but the cats love that funkier aroma of Innova. I could care less about chunks of carrots - I know they're useless as-is to cats, so I just see that as little pieces of fiber. I'm more interested in the protein, fat, carbs and moisture content, and the stats match up almost exactly to Wellness Core, and for quite a bit less. I get a case for $19.99 with free shipping from the *other* website I buy from for pet food. I compared the cat/kitten food to the indoor cat food and somehow the indoor/weight formula has almost the same calories with less protein and more fat... so I'll be sticking to the regular formula and working on more exercise for the cats.All in all, I highly recommend Innova Cat & Kitten formula!",cats,2
"Before getting the mat I was a little scared of what other students at my vet school were going to think. But my wife and I were losing sleep every night because our cats decided that there new favorite thing to do was bang on the knobs of our doors at night. Needless to say, this was keeping us awake. We have had this mat for a little over a week now and the problem has stopped. Also my friends at school are asking if they can use it to train their cats to stay off the counters. So I would give it a 5 and tell anyone who is thinking about it, to go for it. It is amazing how fast it works!",dogs,3
"When I first got this, I was surprised at it's small size. I was expecting a larger toy, like the one used for children. My dog is a Great Dane, and he can easily fit this in his mouth. I wanted something that he would chase around, but he just grabs it and gnaws on it. Yesterday he chewed one of the knobs right off, and he could have easily choked on it if I wasn't supervising him. I'm thinking about getting the regular kid sized one, which should be harder for him to sink his teeth into.I think it would be a fun toy for a small dog to chase around, but if you have a large dog, I would look for something different.",dogs,3

I had purchased the Palisades II backpack which is at least 6 times the cost of this one and found this one to work much better for my dog. I couldn't believe the low price. It's designed for larger sized dogs such as dobermans or larger. Doesn't move around if secured properly. Comes with rain cover and soft water bowl. I would guess this will hold up for a while.,dogs,3
"Although he normally tears them to shreds in less than a week, my American Eskimo still grabs this toy first, when I tell him to bring me a toy from his stash of balls, rubber, stuffed and plastic toys.The donkey has a device inside that makes a ""Hee haw"" sound when squeezed and my son enjoys removing the device through the velcro opening. It's almost like having a Pinata for dogs. I put the device back inside, seal the velcro and we start the game all over again.",dogs,3
Very nice lil collar! I love the fact that its completely waterproof. It fits well and very secure once you get it on. And best of all the colors are pretty :),dogs,3
"This was a great toy for my 8 week old kitten. He didnt like/use the scratch pads at all...but he loved the ball. However it only took him about 5-10 minutes to figure out how to get the ball out. If you keep putting the ball back in, its a fun toy but doesnt serve as a great scratching utility.",cats,2
"I've had great success with the item. Yes, I agree that you have to get the instructions out each time you reprogram it. But since I only have to do that when I changed the batteries (which last for months) and when I was originally setting it up, it really isn't a problem.You do need to limit it to dry food; I can't see how it would work with moist food at all without gumming up the works. The minimum is 1/4 cup. If these don't meet your situation, I'd suggest one of those units where you manually measure out each of the meals for 4 - 8 days.",cats,2
"This is Rigley's 4th sheepskin tug. It's his favorite toy! Although it is not made to withstand the torque of an 83 pound Golden Retriever on one end and husband on the other, it lasts as best it can. Even when it gets down to pieces it is still the first thing Rigley brings to us for play. There will always be a sheepskin tug in his toy box.",dogs,3
"I have a 1 y/o husky. Putting the thing on him was a nightmare, he felt humiliated and scared and did everything to take it off, scratching it against every possible corner and scratching it off the nose with his own claws. Walking with it was a drama, every single day, for a week. Nothing worked, neither treats , nor kisses. In the end, he destroyed the whole thing when he got a chance.I think this collar works on puppies. Tricking an adult dog into it is close to impossible, especially a dominant one like mine.",dogs,3

"I owned a LM-900 (the previous generation's 'Mega') for two years of excellent service...then the gears in the rake started skipping. I bought the LME-9250 (same as the 9000 but with the cabana top...it was the only one they had at Petsmart at the time). Anyway, the Elite line is terrible! They tried to modify the design so that the rake is easily removable, but this causes a host of other problems.1. Rake has a sweeping rather than scooping motion. Litter wasted, not nearly as effective as the original line (i.e. LM-900).2. Waste gets trapped behind the rake from the first pass on.3. Rake hangs up on waste.4. Rake's rollers break. This has something to do with the angle of the rake and the length of the comb--it acts like a lever and stresses the rake during the sweeping motion. When the rollers break you need a new rake. Mine broke within two weeks of purchasing.Do yourself a favor and avoid the elite line. It's more of a pain than a standard litterbox! I bought the classic model (LM-900) on Amazon after returning the elite to Petsmart yesterday.",cats,2
"I've tried the Littermaid and a host of the traditional litter boxes. Nothing has come close to the ease of use the Scoop Free and everything else has had an obvious odor. On two occasions I have been asked, ""Where's the litterbox?"" from guests when they realize we have cats and zero odor.The cats:1) 18lb Russian Blue, 13 years old2) 10lb Calico, 12 years oldEach cat has their own litterbox. We get about 3 weeks of use out of each refill cartridges.My only complaint:For the money, these cartridges should be 100% plastic lined. The current design has a plastic lined base, but urine can still creep up the sides and ""wet"" the cardboard.Highly recommended.",cats,2

I also purchased a scraper tool to scrape the plaque off my dogs teeth. The gel really does take away the buildup and keeps your dogs teeth clean! I was impressed with the product. The product is recommended three times a day, but I am not home for an hour in the middle of the day. Also, I was unaware that your dog could not have water for the 30 minutes before adminsitering the gel and 30 after. Product is still great, I was just unaware of these directions.",cats,2

"I was/am a loyal Littermaid customer for years. I have owned 4 electric litter boxes LM700, LM900 (two of these) and LME5500. The LM900 is wonderful...The LME5500 is a piece of CRAP! The motor sounds like a jet engine compared to the other models. It hangs up, and YES I was using their litter. The cog broke after 3 months. The timer for delayed cleaning at night (they must have added this feature because of the bloody noise.) didn't work half the time. I can not say enough bad things about this product. Over $200 for 3 months and I took pics of it in the recycle bin to send to the unhelpful people in customer service at Littermaid. I hate waste.....so this should tell you how much this product stinks!",cats,2

"I bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs. It doesn't really work, and I haven't been able to sucessfully use it yet and I've had it for about 2 months. It won't stay in place, the clamps just slide around on the counter. Maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that wasn't smooth. The clamps are really hard to get open, so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job. On the bright side I can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose.",cats,2

"This works well for my mulish terrier mix who jumps on visitors and nips from excitement. I love to take my dogs everywhere but her jumping and biting was becoming more than an annoyance - it was a safety issue for older family members and I didn't want to leaver her home. I had to ""zap"" her a few times at the low level when she first wore it, but now she immediately settles just from the beep and is more responsive to my voice commands alone, even when she's not wearing the collar.However, I lost the remote on vacation and then the collar was worthless. I couldn't find a way to replace the remote without replacing the entire item, which I did, because it works. But paying for it twice because the remote slipped out of my pocket really stinks, so keep your eye on it!",dogs,3
"I have had such a good experience with this product I need to write a follow-up.My cat is now emotionally attached to this scratcher! I see her lounging around, her head and upper body propped up against the scratcher. When I came home in the past, she would normally run around in excited circles and then plop on the area rug for a tummy rub. Now she runs to the scratcher first, claws it a couple times, THEN heads over for her rug routine. Whenever she is excited she runs over and claws the scratcher. She is no longer interested in the sofa.I just put in a replacement scratching board, so that's 1 replacement in 6 months. I can live with that expense, it'll take 22 years+ at that rate to equal the cost of replacing a sofa. Haven't replaced the main ramp yet, but the sparkly toy only lasted a couple weeks after it was discovered. I put a shallow brick in the hollow area underneath the ramp to give it some extra stability.I am so glad I went with this product. SCRATCHING PROBLEM SOLVED.---------------(Original review)I saw this scratcher once before I bought it. I passed on it initially because it is made entirely of cardboard and I thought it was cheap. It is also not that great looking because it has cartoon-like drawings on the outer ramp. Then I bought a sofa and needed a way to protect it. Our cat destroyed the previous one. A coworker told me the Alpine Scratcher was really good, so I bought it. My concerns about the cheapness entirely disappeared once I put it down and saw my cat go at it within hours. Over the next couple days I found evidence she had been using it more--parts of dead cat claw around the scratcher and flakes of torn cardboard. At that point I didn't care what I had paid for a piece of cardboard, it was saving mounds of money because my kitty wasn't interested in the sofa anymore. It's been a month or two and I haven't seen any evidence that my kitty's been scratching the new sofa.",cats,2
"I was a bit leary about buying this. In general, I haven't found these sort of products to be all that effective. In this case, I decided to try this to get rid of a pet stain on my finished hardwood floor. It seems the pet's urine got trapped under the leg of a couch, where it worked its way into the wood and made a dark stain. The Bona wood floor cleaner I use had zero impact. I didn't expect much from this product (or any other, since the damage I had usually requires sanding and refinishing). But, I gave it a shot. The first application didn't do anything I could see. However, when I used it again, surprise! It did not totally eliminate the stain, but it broke it up and made it much less noticeable. It did also eliminate the residual odor. And, this stuff smells good. Other such products I have used either smelled of chemicals or were very overpowering. This has a pleasant scent going on, which disipates in a reasonable amount of time. After the largely successful application on my floor, I decided to spray my couch to reduce the dog smell. It did the job.",cats,2
"We bought this for a ""volunteer"" cat that started coming around that we wanted to keep warm on the cool nights. We can't invite her in to be with our cats so why not keep her comfy outside. Well, let me tell ya, once we plugged it in and she realized it was warm she sticks like glue. We ended up placing a cat bed on top of it to make it soft. Since this is made for outdoor use, it is hard plastic with a removable fleece cover. Not much sponge. So placing a cat bed on top made it perrrrrfect in her eyes and ours. I recommend it!!",cats,2

"This was recommended by a friend who said it worked for all but 1 of her cats, so it may not work for every cat. However, with my 2 it works great! I sprayed all their usual scratch areas, and they immediately smelled to investigate. Since I sprayed a week ago, they have not ONCE scratched in those areas. They still climb on the furniture in question, so it isn't a repellant, but the territorial scratching behavior is completely gone.Furthermore, they seem to be getting along a lot better since the spraying. One cat used to dominate the other, but now they are getting along much better, and the timid cat doesn't seem so afraid! I think the scratch zones were creating a hostile/territorial environment where they were both feeling stressed, and that has basically vanished. Also, this stuff has no smell to humans and has no chemicals. Highly recommended!",cats,2
"My dogs love this and so far, they have not ripped it apart. I have about 30 toys in a bin in the living room and while several of the toys in this line are popular, this is the one they fall asleep with. The noise is loud but that is the reason they love it. I only wish it was a little bigger.I would watch any dog with any toy with a chip initially to make sure they don't get the chip out. I own/foster greyhounds and so far the worst they do is to break the chip but they all seem to enjoy the clicky noise the broken chip makes.",dogs,3
"I purchased this bed for my outdoor dog expecting it to warm up to compensate for temperatures in the 20s and 30s. We have had several days in the 40s and the bed is not warming up outside.

Cannot recommend for outdoor use. good thing amazon takes returns.",dogs,3

"I do not have cats, but I used this products for my two large rabbits who pee a lot. I saw TWBCL commercial on TV and decided to give it a try. I must say we were very impressed that it completely masked the smell of urine in their cages. Though a bit loose, it does clump well enough to scoop out. I've read other comments on the smell. I agree with another commenter that it smells like being around a barn. Not a pungent scent, but raw and natural...like hay bales and corn. (Not surprising.)Pros:-Hides or prevents urine/ammonia scent. (No funky odors greeted you when you entered the room.)-No perfumes or other harmful chemicals. (By rabbits' runny eyes and noses cleared up.)-No dust issues or sneezing spells with the rabbits.-Biodegradable and clumps.Cons:-It's more expensive than I want to pay regularly. (I went through a 7 lb bag in 1.5 weeks.)-Litter doesn't flush too well. (Toilet started to back up a little, so I stopped flushing it.)Final note",cats,2
"I have 3 cats; 2 males and 1 female. I ordered 2 of these litter boxes because it was the only self-cleaning litter box I could find with a plastic hood (the boy cats like to hike their legs way up in the air so a plastic hood was required). My biggest issue with this litter box was the rake. It would miss the waste, smoosh the waste against the sides of the litter box, or smash it against the back of the litter box. Also, waste would get trapped in the rake and it would just get yucky. I had to scrub the litter box and the rake weekly to get it clean and it was very time consuming. Also, the litter trays were very expensive and didn't last nearly as long as they were supposed to. The litter trays didn't even last an entire week because of the smell. The urine would just sit in the crystals and the solid waste that did get raked up underneath the trap filled up quickly and just sat there. Every time the trap would lift up for the rake, you could smell the terrible waste odor throughout the house. One of my cats got fed up with the smell and started using the bathroom on the bathroom rug. So I returned these litter boxes and went back to the old fashioned kind that you clean yourself. On the positive side, these litter boxes were very roomy and attractive. The hood stayed on them very securely and the cardboard litter trays never leaked. But they just didn't work out. Amazon was very nice about me returning them.",cats,2
"I've tried other flea combs and hated them. This one however is very nice. Collects fleas like you've never seen before. Its uncanny. I had no idea my indoor cat had so many. this comb definitely helped me deflea my poor cat. You have to be careful though. You must dip this comb immediately after catching a flea in hot soapy water. I recommend the original blue dawn. Also let the fleas sit in the bowl for a bit to make sure they die, and flush them. I made the mistake of trying to throw them down my sink drain, and well they hopped right back up lol",cats,2

"I have bought a lot of these over the years, and I've never had a dog that didn't like them. Mine go through phases where they want them and then will neglect them for a while. Somehow, when one dog gets into chewing them, the others take them back up. You do need to watch the bone, as eventually it will get nibbled away to the point that a dog could swallow too large a piece and either choke or have an obstruction, but this is the case with all chew toys. They aren't cheap, but they last longer than softer things and don't make a mess. I keep several lying around the house at all times.",dogs,3

"I was in line at Petsmart and the man in front of me was buying Bil Jac dog food. That was about 6 years ago. I asked him about it because I had never heard of it. He happened to be a Scientist who had been on a dog food study team and said it was the best of all they rated. I have 12 toy poodles ( I use to breed them) and this dog food they all loved immediately. The best part is it is the only small kibble I have found that isn't so hard. I have tried so many of the more expensive, better brands and they always turned their noses up at it, but would eventually, reluctantly, eat it. Bil Jac crumbles more easily for these little guys. For Picky eaters as well. It works well with dogs who have teeth problems and older dogs as well as it does not hurt their teeth to break the kibble. In a pinch I have had to buy other food for them and they never like it. The other kind I had to soak in water before feeding them because it was so hard. I promise your dogs will love this food and it's so good for them too. I have always let my dogs ""graze"" ( I am a big believer of that) and leave food down all the time and they never over eat with this or get fat. Normal BM's too. Can't say enough good stuff about this dog food. Once your dog gets a taste of this, they will never want another brand! Oh, it is for big dogs too!",dogs,3
"Wanted to try on my own to get rid a my cat's tapeworm. I had seen the white pieces of the worm on her rectum. It was 3 pills. The first one was wasted, mainly my fault. The second one was given in a really good treat. I think she ate most of it. Have not seen any tell-tell signs on her rectum since then so I am assuming it worked. The delivery was very fast. I will use them again.",cats,2
We have two dogs and one has developed a very loud high pitched bark that makes my skin crawl. This collar has been a god-send for both dogs in a house that has high ceilings so sounds seem to magnify. I'm sure the neighbors appreciate the collars too. One dog used to constantly bark at airplanes and birds when outside. Since we live in a fligt path for DEN it was quite annoying.The only thing to watch out for is if your dog likes to stick their head out the car window it will go off from the force of the wind.,dogs,3
"I have purchased several of these collars for different cats over the years, and as gifts for my friends' cats. I have one active, outdoor cat who has had his red bikini collar for almost 4 years, and it still looks great. When it gets dirty, I toss it in the washing machine, and viola! It looks like new. The sturdy nylon and round profile keep it looking good through many scratching and grooming sessions. Only one of my cats has ever broken one -- she caught it on a tree branch and it broke away, as expected, and I fount it hanging there the next day. It's wonderful for long-haired cats, since it doesn't mat the fur. The best part is, it fits kittens at about 8 weeks of age. For the price, you can't beat this collar.",cats,2
This leash broke the day i bought it. i have a 40lb Norwegian Elkhound and it couldn't even handle him. i figured this wasnt really a quality product but i didnt expect it to be that bad.,dogs,3
"It's large, it's basically un-breakable. The dog Loves playing soccer with it pushing all over the yard.. Great work out for him..",dogs,3
"As other reviewers have mentioned, the cats love this thing. The patterns on the fabric part seem to interest them and they track the dark areas as the toy moves past, pouncing when it goes around the corner. They also like to grab it with paws or teeth when they capture it.",cats,2
My cat love's to take a bath he's so funny. he isn't one for blow dyer that he can do with out he goes in an out of the house we have feral cats here where he gets his fleas from most of the time so this worked great making sure de-fleaing him that I was able to also get all the eggs now he's so much more happier,dogs,3
"Hi. I have purchased Kong products for the longest time and have always been 100% satisfied.This however, is by far, the worst toy I have ever bought.Within 3 minutes, my dog had all the tennis ball ""fuzz"" off the ball and the squeaker was busted in just a few minutes as well. Now its just a regular ""football"".Also, if you read the description it says ""made in the USA"" but when I received the product, the packaging said ""design and idea"" in the USA and manufactured with materials from China! If you are not already aware of this, never, ever buy a dog toy made anywhere other then the USA (do your own research to confirm why).Thankfully amazon refunded me and told me not to even waste my time returning the item (what are they going to do with a used dog toy).Stay away from this product as it is a total waste of money, and a major safety hazard for your pooch!Hope this review helps.",dogs,3
"yea, the thing smells when you take it out of the package, but unless you live in a ziplock bag it goes away after day 1. this kennel is awesome and looks cool, but it.edit:2 nights after receiving this kennel and the first night using it, my shitzu destroyed it. i mean ripped the s*** out of it like nothing. if your dog enjoys their own space, has no incentive to get out and is obedient this is the kennel for you. if not, DO NOT BUY.",dogs,3
"This is the name brand flea medicine, which I don't think we can name in the reviews either, but it's easy enough to guess which one. The instructions are simple, this saves VAST amounts of money, and there is no reason NOT to buy this. I prefer to get this thru amazon, as this is just one of the vials for only 20, where on the Flea Doctors website, the smallest package is for 3 vials for 45.. I typically only need 1 dose for my pets to get rid of fleas, so this works best for me.",dogs,3
"The first pair went back to Amazon for a bad high speed operating switch. The second pr. also soon had a bad high speed switch and were then mailed to a repair shop, still under warranty, postage not paid by Oster. The clippers were used on one dog, about half a dozen times.",cats,2

Product did not work in relieving my dogs itchy skin. No effect in any way. No help with hot spots areas.,cats,2
"This kennel arrived within a few days which was great because my puppy had grown out of his small kennel. I thought the kennel was larger, so for the price it was actually higher than the pet store. My only complaint was that it didn't come with a food and water dish, which I thought came with ALL kennels. I had to go out and pay another $15.00 to get one. I would have returned the kennel but had to have a place for my puppy.",cats,2
"Well designed, clever, and very motivating for my cat!! He chases these all over the house, makes them spring up from the floor, and the fact that they kind of &#34;roll&#34; on their own when they are nudged or are on uneven surfaces makes him even more determined to &#34;get&#34; them! Great to leave around the house so my cat can play on his own too. Great colors, very sturdy, and I like that I don't really have to worry about him breaking them or hurting himself. I have to keep buying more because so many get lost around the house (under the couch especially - that is his favorite game!) and we can never seem to have too many lying around for him. This is my third package so far and I will keep buying these again in the future too!",cats,2

"I purchased this fountain because the vet suggested my cat drink more water because of constipation issues. The fountain gets dirty very quickly--within a couple of days...starts smelling like a dirty fish bowl. I find the motor hard to remove. It may be my fingers but it takes me a good ten minutes of prying and twisting to get the motor out. I bought the cleaning set and I scour every surface and put the thing back together. My cat loves it though, so I have to give it a few stars. If it was easier to clean I would give it five.",cats,2
"Amazon seller (uxcell) did not ship a Coralife/Aqueon thermometer. It was a knock-off, without the Coralife branding, different packaging, and the battery was running. The genuine Coralife thermometer must have the plastic film pulled away from the battery for the battery to start functioning. Seller is dishonest in describing this as a Coralife product. Amazon credited me, and I will try reordering.I reordered, and they again did not ship a genuine Coralife product. It was a knock-off, same as the previous order. Amazon has been alerted to this issue, and will be investigating.",fish aquatic pets,4

"We bought these and set them up on two of our mouse cages. When we noticed all of our boy mice were acting up in their cage with the water bottle, we realized something was up. We checked the other cage with our runt mouse and found it curled up in a ball on the brink of dieing of dehydration. We managed to save it... I hope, it is currently in critical condition... but if we'd been so much as an hour later she would have died horribly.I cannot emphasize this enough",small animals,5
"I put this in pretty solid clay ground. I used a 24"" breaker bar placed through the eye-hole to torque it down as far as possible (applying down force and turning at the same time). I see my dog running at near full speed all the time until his chain runs out and I've yet to see this stake budge. I can't move it at all either. I have no worries about the durability of this stake, and should serve us well for years to come.",dogs,3

I'm sure it would be a great toy except for one thing. It never came to my house. That's all I really have to say.,dogs,3
"When I received this in the mail, I bought batteries and put it near by doorway. It definitely worked and you would hear it make a slight buzzing sound every time it went off and a ready light would go off instead of the green light that was normally on. My roommate event set it off when she was talking really loudly! The dogs looked at it mysteriously then stopped barking. After a week or two it stopped working, It would light up red still but the same slight buzzing sound wasn't going off anymore. I took the battery out, put it back in and no luck. Unfortunately I didn't return it in time so now i'm stuck with a piece of plastic that lights up red and doesnt do anything for the dogs barking! So it worked, just not for long. I wouldn't purchase it! Save yourself the $20 and get one that actually works consistently.",dogs,3
"I think that this is one of the most genius ideas out there! I hated cleaned the litter box 3-4 times a day, but now that I've bought this (I've only had it for a couple of days), I clean it effortlessly in half the time! It took me a couple of times to figure out just how much litter to put in it, how to roll it, etc., but the extra ""training time"" was well-worth it! My cats love it, and it actually cuts down the amount of litter they trample all over the house (with a mat, of course). I'll keep you updated on how it works out for me over time.",cats,2

My inside/outside kitties spend the night in a crate after a day of running around outside. They have two for water and two for food, and it keeps the crate much cleaner. Don't know how I'd manage without them. They can be attached to the door of a pet carrier, too.",bunny rabbit central,1

"While a bit pricey, this product is excellent; especially for dogs who are hard to please. Being a dog rescuer for over 15 years, I have had my share of ""picky eaters,"" but none have ever turned down the Buckaroo Beef. And I feed it dry; just crumble up some in a bowl. You can reconstitute it if you like, but it's not necessary. And as long as you reseal the package, it keeps ""forever."" Great product!",dogs,3
No rusting and a smooth cut. Bought these to replace all metal blades that rusted no matter how well I oiled them before putting them away. Quick delivery & quality blades.,cats,2
"Since dogs are part of the family, they should have a place where the family hangs out. The crate cover made the crate look very nice. The whole 3 pc set is machine washable. The bed provides a decent amount of cushioning, though as my dog gets older (she's 7), I may have to add another pad underneath it. Be warned that the cover will shrink. I've washed it 3 times so far and it shrunk a little each time. When it was brand new, it covered my 42 inch crate perfectly. Now, the cover is 1-1.5 inches short, but still better than without.",dogs,3
"I bought this pad for my 5 month-old Chihuahua who loves to tear and drag his wee wee pads. So far so good-- yes he can still tear at it a bit in the middle, but at least he's doing his business completely on the pad now, and for the most part, the pad is staying in the tray. Hallelujah.",dogs,3

"The product has worked as described so far- sprays citronella whenever my dog barks. So far, I've not experienced any problems with it. But, note that it's not guaranteed to keep your dog from barking. My dog's barking problem has been intermittent- she'll have good days without barking at other dogs that are simply walking by. Then she'll have bad days when she'll go nuts. The effectiveness of the collar is dependent, in large part, on your dog's personality.",dogs,3
"Grew like a charm in the window; per reviews from others I only put about half the grass seed in there and it was still really thick / lush. Of the four cats, only one of them chowed down on it pretty regularly.While the packaging was pretty conveinent, the cats didn't like it very much",cats,2
"I have a dog that has been on glucosamine for about 8 years now, and Cosequin is the best, in my opinion. I originally learned of this product at the Colorado State University Vet Hospital in Ft Collins. I had taken my dog there with knee problems (luxating patellas) and they sold a bottle to me. I have tried other products, but think this is the best. I now give my other older dog one a day too, and she is doing much better. She was having problems getting up the steps, but not anymore.",cats,2

"My cat loves it. I could never get her to sit still when I brushed her, but with the FURminator, she lays down and purrs. It did take a couple of times for her to just lay there. At first, she would walk away and come back over and over again. After about 3 sessions, she stays put. I always get so much hair off of her (DSH)! Now, when we pet her, there isn't hair flying around. I can wear black pants and not worry (too much) about her rubbing up against my legs. The FURminator has really decreased the amount of hair floating around our house.After FURminating, you will definately need to vacuum the area!I was hesitant to purchase this tool because of the price and I wondered if my cat would really sit still long enough for me to use it. It is worth every penny!",cats,2

I've since tried this product on a fresh vomit stains after I'd already cleaned the worst of it (which it's also meant to get rid of, according to the bottle), and it hasn't worked, either.

He is a 3 year old Collie that had an injury at 15 months that has caused him some early problems with arthritis. I was hoping he would do better on this stuff, but so far, he is not.

"These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly ""indestructible"" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs. Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily! Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-) In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed",dogs,3
My cats like this food but not anymore that what I was feeding them before. I was feeding them Nutro Natural Choice Indoor formula prior to trying out Natural Balance. Nutro Natural Choice brand is signigicantly cheaper and still has a good ingredient list (no by-products/meal or high grains content). I also didn't notice any difference in terms of my cats litter behavior or coats in switching the foods. Another thing that is minor but that I didn't like is that the cans came all dented. For a balance of cost and ingredients I think I'll be going back to Nutro after this order has been finished...,cats,2
"I searched high and low for the right products when I brought home my first kitty, and after extensive reading, I took a chance on the Omega. I would pay TWICE what I did for it, knowing what I do now.First - the hood. Kitty gets privacy - I don't have to stare at cat...stuff.Second - the design. GENIUS. Why should you scoop when this thing sifts for you? Basically you roll the thing over - all the ""chunks"" get trapped by the slats, and all the clean litter goes back through. Set it upright, and pull out the little drawer. Voila. No sifting, no scooping - NO WORK.I recommend you buy World's Best Cat Litter along with it. It's 100% natural and completely septic safe. I keep the litterbox in the bathroom. It takes all of 30 seconds to roll it over, pull out the drawer and flush the stuff a few times. Put the drawer back in and go on your way.You never touch litter or cat stuff. Why didn't someone think of this sooner?",cats,2
"This was awful! Went through the setup and it worked perfectly. Testing on the dog and it didn't work. Seems to have a range issue.

Sent it back and ordered the PetSafe PDBDT and it works well, even through the house. Dog is running much less and listening much better.",dogs,3
"Hopefully, my title says it all. I have a very high-strung 2.5 year old herding breed dog. Last year he was fine with thunder and fireworks. This year, he's a mess.Yesterday, when I left his new bottle of Pet Calm at home and went with him to my mom's, he was trying to dig through the drywall, climb into my t-shirt, was panting, drooling, wide-eyed, and I could feel his muscles bunching and clenching. His whole body was shaking. The 3rd of July fireworks were driving him crazy.Today, on the 4th, I gave him Pet Calm (3 droppers and he's 50 lbs.) and wrapped him in an Ace Wrap (google search TTouch Ace Wrap dog instructions). The fireworks are going off in the park right behind my condo. My dog is calm, laying in the middle of the floor, looking not too concerned. He does get up and move when there's a strong boom, but otherwise, he looks very calm. He does not look dopey or drugged.I was about to go to the vet's and get Acepromazine or Xanax for him, but I don't think it will be necessary.I used the Pet Calm late last night without the Ace Wrap, and had the same resulting calmness and he slept in his own bed instead of under mine.Great product!

Then, one of my dogs (I have 2 beagles) became sick (unrelated to the food) and we had to switch foods, and wound up just going and switching for both. It didn't dawn on me until a few weeks later that my dogs were no longer gassy (and we all breathe much easier!).

But when my dog developed a weight problem, and the vet vetoed ""doggie treats"", these little goodies kept ME out of the dog house. When the treats stopped coming, my dog whined and put on a show of such pitiable neediness, that I had to do something to quiet her down. I remembered that the ingredients in her Dental Stix were healthful and not likely to hurt her weight loss program a bit. I went back to using these as directed, and my dog kept on losing weight, reached her goal, and has stayed there. And we did it without her feeling deprived. Not bad at all!",dogs,3
"Thought that this litter box would be great for our two cats but it's NOT! First of all the cover does not stay on too well and it is always is shifting. It is hard to clean out by wash out the box since it is so bulky and it tends to get stuck on the sides and you have to keep rinsing the box over and over to get the litter out (if you do not have to liners that fit this box size). In terms of order control, it works to an extend, defiantly keeps cat poo out of sight, but the cats still drag out the litter on to the floor and on steps of the cat box!!! With all being said it is Not a great product, I would not recommend it.",cats,2
"Instinct from Nature's Variety dry kibble is an excellent product. We have researched every brand of food on the market and decided on this brand.

I am sure that if your dog is not picky, then he/she would love the duck, beef, and other flavors.We actually mix the canned Instinct chicken with the kibble and they seem to enjoy that much more than just one or the other. Our Vet constantly tells us how impressed he is with the health of our dogs, especially how healthy and soft their coats are.I would, and have, recommended this food to anyone that I know with dogs.",dogs,3

"Like some of the other reviewers, our poor little cats began foaming at the mouth intensely almost immediately after they licked themselves (One is about 8 months old, the other about 4 years old). It is very concerning that the product instructions indicate that it is best to completely saturate your animal, yet almost instantly our animals had a severe reaction. After about 5 minutes they were fine and their behavior never changed, but it was extremely frightening to see them with white foam all over their mouths. Do not spray this product on your pets!!! It does kill adult fleas on contact (so I suppose if you want to spray your furniture or carpet then it might be ok-although it still makes me weary to have it in my home after this incident). Keep your babies safe and do not spray this product on them or anywhere near them!!!!",cats,2

"The leash is very reflective which is nice. I wasn't happy with the quality of the product. I have seen other leashes like this that were created on a rubber core and the wrapping was very tight. This leash has a nylon rope at the core, the reflective part is wrapped around it (loosely) and the wrapping came undone the second time I used it.",dogs,3
"This litter box is a pretty cool idea. It works the way it says it does, and I love that I don't have to remove the lid and scoop every day. There is still the occasional ""sticking"" problem, so I either bang on the bottom or take a scoop to it once a week just to get the sticky stuff unstuck (I have to take the lid off to add litter, anyway, so it's no big deal), but it's still better than scooping every day. It's a little hard to judge the litter level inside the box with the lid on (it's dark in there), but adding litter once a week seems to work out fine. I've had some litter leak out the side when rolling, but I think it may be because I'm banging the bottom of the box too hard when trying to get stuff unstuck, which sends loose litter flying over the tray into the lid where it's not supposed to be. All in all, I like this box, and I may get a second one to replace my booda dome.",cats,2
"I bought this after reading many of the reviews, and I concur. They work. My kittens also love the taste of tasty fleas and after a lovely meal of a delicate flea, they end up with booty worms. This is not that hard to administer. I just sneak up on them and pet them, and in a swift maneuver, I squeeze their jaws open and toss the pill as far back as I can, and then hold their mouths closed till I feel they've swallowed. I hate the dirty looks I get during this process, but it has to happen. I reward the kittens with frozen scraps of fish that I save for special occasions and they stop hating me soon thereafter. My new vet is charging $23 per kitty for their prescription pill, and I get 3 pills for $14 on Amazon, so if you can get the kitty to trust you enough to shove it down their throat, you can save a lot of money if your cats love to eat fleas as a little treat.",cats,2
"This product is a hard plastic disk, about the size of a small frisbee. You put it into the microwave, and warm it for the required amount of time. It stays warm for 12 hours and keeps your pet warm. The hard plastic disk gets slipped inside of a velour cover, both to provide a bit of softness and to keep the animal from direct contact with the disk, which does get too hot to touch comfortably for long periods of time.I got this for my cat, who just had surgery and was confined to a kennel, so she could no longer go to her favorite Warm Spot (under the covers, with me providing auxiliary heating).I slipped the Snuggle Safe into her kennel, on top of her bedding, where it kept her warm all night long. Unlike other posters here, I had no problems with her ignoring or avoiding the Snuggle Safe.Because the Snuggle Safe doesn't have any wires or electric current running through it, I felt safe leaving it in her kennel while I slept - even though she has a habit of chewing or destroying her bedding. The hard plastic of the Snuggle Safe, which possibly uncomfortable, is also pretty much indestructable - a bit bonus if you're worried about safety.-",cats,2

"I've had three of these, and as everyone has noted, they truly frighten the cat away from off-limits areas. However, the sensor is unreliable, and all three died after just a few months--well before the canister of gas was even empty. Fortunately, the cat was so traumatized that she still stayed away from forbidden areas for more than a year. But now she's forgotten, so guess I'll get another one. I kept the old canisters to use as ""scarecrows""--once in a while, I switch them out with the working one.",cats,2

"After watching the included video we were ready to send the collar back, it looked like a lot of trouble to get the dog acclimated, but we decided to try! Once we adjusted the collar and fitted it on our usually well-behaved Miniature Schnauzer we were again ready to send it back, He wiggled, shook, rubbed his head in the grass and otherwise objected! Surprisingly, within a very short time he settled down and we went for a very pleasant walk. Since then, he has worn it on our daily 2 1/2 mile walks without a problem. The collar really does work. Our dog liked to walk faster than my wife and I. Holding him back could get tiring on a long walk. Just tightening the leash stops his pulling. The collar seems a bit overpriced, there's not much to it and it is a bit difficult to determine the proper size, (I had to go to the manufacturer's website), hence 4 stars rather than 5.",dogs,3
"Love this item! Really handy for those pets with lots of fur or the types that shed alot. It has definitely helped in the category of shedding in that it gets more hair when you brush, so less on your furniture or clothes. Real easy to use and not sharp edged to hurt yourself if you pick it up by the head or brush against it.",cats,2
"This is hands down my cat's favorite toy! A woman at PetCo recommended them to me because her cats loved them- I took her advice, and a month later, I had to buy more on Amazon because the old ones have all been lost from being shoved under the fridge! My cat IGNORES balls, bells, other stuffed toys, but goes crazy over these little mice. They are a perfect size for her to play with- she carries them around in her mouth all around the house. We even have to hide them sometimes to calm her down (she gets so hyper from the catnip!) Highly recommended.",cats,2
"We have a new Labrador Retriever puppy, now 10 weeks old.They grow FAST and LARGE!This crate is an additional one to a similar one purchased a number of years ago. This one is an improvement in several ways...2 Doors comes in handy for where you are to place the crate.Wheels to help move it around.Removable/movable divider for puppy as it grows. Why do you need this feature? Because, crate training is the way to go with a dog. A dog uses it as his ""den"" for your sake as well as his and is great when PROPERLY applied. A dog usually will not soil his ""den"" area. If too large, as when a puppy, you divide it off into a smaller space for that reason and adjust its placement as the puppy grows. Otherwise, the tendency of the pup is to sleep in one end and soil the other end.(Read all about this training method in a good dog care guide.)Collapses for easy storage and transport. Finish is a black enamel paint that is easy to clean.GREAT purchase!Only downside on all crates I have found, is that I have to replace the liner tray in the bottom eventually, and THAT replacement seems to cost about as much as an entire new crate! :(As for this purchase, I feel I got a good deal after browsing the internet and considering the gas prices to go in search of one in my area.",dogs,3
"I've tried everything from standard choke chains, prong collars, body harnesses and other more gimmicky collars in an attempt to get my Boxer to stop pulling so excessively when we walk. I can certainly tolerate the occasional pull due to a squirrel or a rabbit, but my dog pulls constantly. So hard, in fact, that she is left gasping for air. With a body harness, she throws up after the walk because of the pressure on her stomach.The Gentle Leader head harness is the only thing that she responds to. Another reviewer here calls this harness cruel and acts like it's meant to stop dogs from turning their heads and looking around. In reality, my dog is able to turn her head in any direction she likes, because most of the time there is no external pressure on the harness. A little tug when she walks ahead is all that's required to remind her to stay by my side.She does paw at the harness for ten - fifteen seconds a few times per walk, but then it's over and she gets back to walking like nothing ever happened. This very minor and short-term discomfort is much less traumatic than her self-inflicted choking/throwing up from other collars.I can't say enough good things about this collar. Not only is it not cruel, it is the first collar I've ever found that protects my dog from the pain she inflicts on herself during a walk.",dogs,3

"I have been using this filter on my 29 gallon freshwater aquarium for 7+ years at this point, and compared to my old fluval-style filter, I can honestly say I adore this machine. It is relatively quiet, especially compared to many air-pumps on the market, which would easily mask out the sound of this filter. In the entire time that I have used this filter, I have never had any mechanical problems, and has constantly provided excellent filtration for my setup. Some reviews said that the pump is too powerful, but I tend to disagree. If you leave your water level a bit lower, the water runs down a ramp and gently hits the water. The cartidges you can purchase are great, but rather pricy. You can easily cut yourself some filter-mesh and fill the included plastic media container with whatever you like for much less. From an experienced aquarium keeper, my rating says it all, 5 stars!",fish aquatic pets,4

"To be honest, I do not own a huge dog (my pup is only 10 pounds)...so why did I get the huge bed? I have a good, old-fashioned bamboo mama-san (bowl)chair that I have not been able to part with. However, the cushions get well worn and can be lumpy or simply not in colors that I would like. I decided to try the largest size dog bed and it is a PERFECT fit! It is far superior in cushioning and so comfy that my family fights over who gets to sit in the chair. We even bought a second one and now have one as a floor cushion for lounging on. These are HIGH quality, well-made and come in fabrics that match my furniture, so they are WELL worth purchasing...EVEN if you have a BIG DOG that is going to use it instead of a big kid!",dogs,3

"We have a very large Maine Coon cat. He's not fat, but 12lbs and large enough to scare our chocolate lab. We previously bought a soft sided carrier just for cats, and he could barely fit into it. This one on the other hand, is much larger and will work really well for us. We take our cat on vacations with us, and have been looking for something just like this. It can fold up into a case which is a bit larger than a briefcase. When open, it will fit on less than 1/2 of the back seat of our toyota corolla. Love all the different ways you can open it and he seems to like being in his cave.Ideally we would have found something between this and our first carrier, but if we ever have 2 regular sized cats, this one will fit both perfectly.",dogs,3

This did not work on her at all but we also have two cats I was hoping would be able to use this as well. The cats absolutely LOVE it!

"This item pays for itself after two or three uses (depending upon the size of your dog(s)). I have an Old English Sheepdog, and it costs almost $100 to get him shaved (which we like to do four times per year). Our breeder recommended the Golden A5 clippers - she said they would last a couple of years and then need to be replaced. We had our first Golden A5 clippers for over four years before we had to replace them - though we did have to replace the blade twice. We kept it very clean - using canned air to blow it clean after every use, and well oiled. I believe good maintenance kept our clippers in good working order for longer.Cuts well and doesn't cut or nick, if used properly - when it does start pulling or nicking, then it is time to replace the blade.Sometimes gets warm to the touch, but turning it off for a few minutes (a well-needed break on the dog's part as well) takes care of that issue - only seems to be an issue after a LONG period of use - but the reason for four stars rather than five.Love this and would recommend it for anyone with patience enough to groom a pet yourself.",cats,2

This is great aversion training for our cat who believes all horizontal areas belong to her. We keep moving this around to various pieces of furniture to keep her from scratching the upholstery or getting onto things that we do not want her on. She avoids the mat whenever she sees it although she has gotten shocked a couple of times when she didn't pay attention. Am using it around the christmas tree with limited success. Since we had to wrap the mat around the base of the tree the cat is able to reach the lower branches and avoid getting shocked. Works great on horizontal surfaces however,dogs,3

"I've used these for several months now and so I think I have a good feel for the product. It's worked out well for our cat and our household. First thing you need is a cat who is reasonably comfortable being handled and, particularly having her paws handled. My cat is in this category, and yet my wife has to help me by scratching and petting the cat to keep her calm and cooperative during installation.You snip off the sharp tips of each claw. This is an essential step. They don't fit right if you don't do this. Then you pre-load the number of Soft Claws you need with superglue (supplied.) Gotta fill them about half-way, and it's rather hard to tell how much glue you've put it them. This is a bit tricky, because these things are small, and I typically get a bit of superglue on my fingers in the process. Once this step is done, you simply hold the Soft Claw, sort of pinching it open, and just slide it on. (You gotta do that thing where you squeeze the paw to make the claw stick out. Superglue is fast-acting, of course, so you only have to keep the cat calm for a minute or 2 after application.At first, I noted my cat was shedding these things pretty fast. I thought they lasted a week or 2 rather than the promised 4-6 weeks. But, I also noted she was working to pull them off with her teeth. (The cat, not my wife.) After the first 2 or 3 weeks, the cat got used to the product and stopped trying to remove them, and now they clearly do last considerably longer. But, you have to check the cat from time to time and, typically, when I notice she's missing 2 or 3, I reapply from the supply of, what?, 40 in each set.These come in clear, but I strongly prefer the bright colors, because it makes it easier to see when they are missing. (Also easy to spot the discarded ones on the floor.)",cats,2

Honestly, I think this stuff does help with fleas(along with regular baths, flea dips and flea tabs).

The siding had enough play in it that I was then able to swing the loose end away, slide the old flap out and slide the new one in.

Poxie walks into the shower and isn't as picky about getting her paws wet so she goes crazy for them. So, Poxie will play forever if you let her and Boo gives up after a while, which is normal habit with most toys anyway :)I adopted both of them from the pound (a year and half apart) and both were noted as being more skittish than ""normal"". Both of them don't like a whole flurry of bubbles drifting down on TOP of them and will startle or run away every once in a while. So, when we play and it's been a while since I brought out the bottle, I start as low or eye level to them as possible (but don't blow directly in their faces) until they get used to the bubbles.I'm giving this four stars simply because the liquid ""may cause stains"" on carpet. So you might want to do a test swatch if you have really delicate fabrics. If your 'nip loving cat startles easily and doesn't like water (not that bubbles popping really is that bad?) then it's probably not the toy for them. If they like floating feathers or things that kinda ""drift"" slowly down, then they might like this :D",cats,2
"I purchased these because I have two cats and my roommate has one nice couch. Instead of hoping the cats don't rough it up too much, I wanted to ensure there was solid protection. These definitely do the trick. I like how easy it is to get them on and they have stayed on for a few weeks so far & don't see them peeling off anytime soon, especially since they are so uncomfortable to touch. The uncomfortable feel ensures that the cats will not be tempted to touch and in fact, haven't dared try. There are also a good amount of strips, in the event a reapplication is needed. Definitely recommend.",cats,2

First in order to even get my little dog interested I had to attach the carpet pieces that were enclosed. Upon doing so the item could not be returned. My dog will not go near it. The steps are way way too shallow for any 23 pound dog to use. I had called to verify that a 23 pound dog would be able to use it and was told absolutely. So now I have a $25 item in my basement without being able to use it. Was not happy with this item.,dogs,3
"Are you looking for a more natural alternative to Hill's or other veterinary prescription diets? If you are, you may have found the answer. I either use this brand or Royal Canin's Urinary S/O for my cats. My cats prefer the Wysong and my cats have not developed problems or blockages due to struvite crystal development since being on this diet.However, before you go replacing your veterinary diet, know what type of crystals your cats develop. This diet, IMHO, is very appropriate for cats that develop struvite crystals and require a more acidic urine. I cannot speak about this diet for cats that develop oxalate crystals. Talk to Wysong and your vet before making the switch if your cat tends to develops only oxalate crystals or both struvite and oxalate crystals.",cats,2

"Seriously... Max is overweight, lazy, and when he walks he looks like he'd rather be sleeping. The only thing that gets him up is a desire to eat, a need to relieve himself (sorry for the graphics), or the sound of a squirrel at the door (seldom happens). Today the ""SlimCat"" arrived, I filled it with kibble, said ""Yeah, right!"" to myself, and set it on the floor. I put one piece of kibble near it and set the ball rolling. The smell of the food got him rocking and rolling, literally. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, he loved it... he spent a half hour kicking it around and eating the diet goodies as they fell out. Now I figure once a day when I leave for work I'll fill it with 1/4 cup of food and Max will be shaking his groove thang again. (Again, all kidding aside, it truly works... and I'm delighted to see Max having fun again. BTW, he's 12 years old.)",cats,2

I suppose I should say &#34;I love it&#34; but how can you love a medicine that has been in use for weeks while one's little guys and gals get Slowly better and there's no way to tell how much it is contributing? Not an instant fix, not allowing things to get worse, maybe holding off infection while they heal in their own slow way... I'd buy more if there were more scrapes...

"I first learned about this product less than 2 years ago while looking to purchase a self-cleaning litterbox. It's price at Walmart was under $6.00 but I decided to purchase it anyway, thinking I could just return it if I didn't like it. I don't like it, I love it!You can clean the litter box in a clean, efficient and timely manner! I use and love Fresh Step litter and spray the sides after every 2nd cleaning, sometimes I go 4 cleanings before spraying again. I have 3 cats and 2 litterboxes, and my one cat is a big, fat, fluffy cat! He urinates right on the side of the box, making it harder to clean up, and the bottom of the box too! This spray makes it super easy for the feces and urine to just come out of the box. I believe in a good quality litter, but having this spray makes it so much easier. I have literally spent 20 minutes cleaning out a box, sweating while trying to scrape the sides of the box, and then get mad at myself for not buying a refill spray! You will definitely spend 5-10 minutes or less when using this spray!The directions tell you to spray and wait to put the litter on, but I can't, so I just spray generously on the bottom and sides by tipping the litterbox to either side after cleaning. Then I do a good cleaning once a month. I also use the spray on the litter scooper too. The ingredients are not harmful and not smelly at all. I used to be able to find it at Walmart, but not anymore, so I now pick it up online here. I love Amazon and their prices are awesome, combined with free shipping and great customer service.",cats,2
"My cat had some serious dental work done a few months ago. The vet sent us home with some high quality food but my cat wasn't too thrilled with it. I looked at other reviews and decided to try this stuff. To my surprise my cat seemed to enjoy it right away. Similar to the vet food, the kibbles are larger than normal food so it helps to ""brush"" his teeth. I still leave a little of the vet food out but he only nibbles - he always eats all the RC. An added bonus is that his habit of puking up his old food on the carpet once or twice a week has pretty much vanished! He's happy and I'm happy!",cats,2

"I've had this litter box for a month now and I love it.Why I ordered the Clever Cat:My cat Alice who is 12 lbs has persistently kicked litter up since she was a kitten. She compulsively digs for minutes after finishing in the box, leaving litter everywhere. I've tried every type of covered litter box ***including the Booda Dome*** and none of them kept litter off the floor. Alice would just kick the litter straight over the center of the Booda Dome out the hole in the front so the stairs didn't function as they were supposed to. Trying the clevercat was my last resort before just giving in to vacuuming every day around the box.The results:Both of my cats took to the box straight away. I helped ease the process by putting some of their soiled litter in the box so they would smell it if they were confused about where to go. As for the litter flinging and tracking:Alice has to poke her head out of the hole while she's going so she can't kick any litter through the top afterward, and there is THE MOST MINIMAL TRACKING I've ever seen from a covered box *when* the box is positioned correctly up against the wall. If I put the box near a table or any other surface the cats WILL try to avoid the lid and they'll jump straight onto the other surface which tracks litter. I now keep the box isolated and there is practically no tracking at all. I have to vacuum maybe once a week.I suppose I COULD have fashioned by own box out of a storage bin but to me $30 is worth the polished look and saving my time and energy. I do think it would be more reasonably priced at $20; that is my only criticism.",cats,2

"It's the Switch & Bait. I bought this product about a year ago & my cats go crazy over them. However those spings we're made of durable soft plastic. The new batch of springs I just purchased (from the same seller & product name as before) is now made of hard cheap metal with sharp points on the ends. They went straight in the recycle bin; I didn't consider even for a second letting my cats play with these.

My birds love these seeds thats why I gave it 2 stars and not 1, cause product itself is OK. That being said, I am highly disappointed at Amazon for their lack of care. I am sure that they would refund or replace the item, but I am still deciding if its even worth to submit a request and have to deal with return shipping and so on for a few dollars. The only reason why I bought this online is so that I didn't have to go to store... This is a good lesson to learn that for perishable and liquid items is maybe better getting to store as it sure takes less time then online shopping and post office all together.",birds,0

My dogs are small and the bite size hearts are perfect for them--they come in other sizes for the Medium & large dog. The zip-lock packaging is great too in keeping them fresh. Check out their dog food. Again, I am so glad I found dog food that my dogs love that is prepared to a higher standard of organic, wholesome ingredients.

"I have 2 (4lb) small breed puppies 1 female and 1 male just so you have a picture. The puppies were definitely attracted to the pads and it was very easy to get them to use the pads which I am grateful. The first pads I ever purchased were the Natures Miracle Advanced Wee Pads and not by choice I just walked in having just gotten my puppies and grabbed the first thing I came across. Now Natures Miracle was a tad expensive so I started looking for another brand more in my price range so I did a lot of research and this brand was rated high by people, then as luck would have it Pet Supplies Plus had a great sale on Four Paws Wee-Wee Pads, now after some use and after the excitement of them actually using the pads I started to become a tad disappointed. You pay a good dollar for these pads and I started to notice things, the size is smaller than the other pads and the 23x23 size meant I had to use 2 of them in my crates and on a side note the actual size of usable pad is 21x21. They are pretty thin and I have felt dampness on the underside of these pads which is a problem since they were sitting on carpet( I have since bought crate replacement trays). When the pups went tinkle it would just sit on the top of the fabric and pool before actually soaked in allowing the pups to walk thru it and tracking it on my carpet. When the female went tinkle she pretty much use up a good portion of the pad so I was changing them often so the price savings now has gone out the door. I also found there was no odor control with these pads.So now I have tried Four Paws Wee-Wee pads, Dynarex Under pads(worst),Simply Right Super Absorbent under pads(very good-still use) and Natures Miracle Advanced Wee Pads(still use)and find Natures Miracle Advanced Ultra is the best by far for doggie wee pads!I have to admit I am impressed on how absorbent Natures Miracle Advanced Ultra turned out to be. They claim to hold 6 cups of liquid and I believe it, this is the only pad with Polymer in it, Polymer helps absorption and keeps the spread of the liquid to a minimum getting more use out of the pad, this pad is also fantastic at keeping odor absorbed. I find Petsmart is the only place I can get these pads in-store in my area. The pad size is larger than the other wee pads at 27x23 compared to 23x24 and Natures usable pad area is pretty close to the 27x23 size where the other pads can be up to 4inches smaller in usable area size (so your 23x24 pad is actually 19x21 inches)because the blue border is non-absorbent and not usable(Dynarex brand)!! I just bought Natures Miracle Advanced Ultra on sale at Petsmart, 100pads for $39 which is a great price but I only use these in my crate due to that high price and for visit at friends houses. For daily use, I now go with Simply Right Super Absorbent 23x36 under pads from Sam's club which is also a very good product, not bad at keeping odor at bay, the size fits replacement crate trays, more room for 2 pups to use and best of all the cheap price tag of $24 for 120 pads and they are sold in-store, no need to order online. I will admit I would use these pads again if need be but there is no real savings in them as you do use more.",dogs,3
"Our first Drinkwell fountain had its motor fried when we had a power surge from lightning. Our cats clearly did not appreciate drinking out of a regular bowl while waiting for the replacement to arrive.This is definitely more work for the human staff - you do need to clean it and replace filters regularly - but we have no doubt that the felines who use the fountain drink FAR more than they would out of a standard water bowl. We've watched our current cat stand drink from the fountain for more than a minute straight.Only complaint is that the fountain can be noisy - took some getting used to and there were several times I thought a pipe had burst or water had been left running in the middle of the night.

"I was thrilled with the idea of potty training Mr. Kitty Pants and eliminating litter forever. Unfortunately, things didn't work as I had hoped. Mr. Pants (age 4.5) was highly distressed at the removal of his trusty litterbox but he reluctantly tried the new contraption. This was met with much praise. Pants couldn't care less. He had never had any previous ""accidents"" but he hated the new litter tray so much that he began finding other places to go. Mostly #2 on the carpet and #1 in the toilet but when he went #1 on my husband's pajamas that was the last straw. The ""CitiKitty"" is in the trashcan after three weeks, the litterbox is back where it was, and Mr. Pants is again quite content. I've seen the videos and testimonials and I'm glad this worked for some, but it is definitely not for every kitty. At the price it is still worth a shot. Best of luck... I retract the previous statement. Try at your own risk. After bringing back his old litterbox, he has begun peeing all over the house!! This product has created a monster and may result in his eventual demise. I was lucky to get a cat as my husband doesn't like them and now that Pants is going all over the house I'm afraid we won't get to keep him.

"What a great product! I have a very vocal Australian Shepherd puppy and was pushed to the brink of insanity by his incessant barking. I consulted a trainer and nothing they recommended worked so they finally told me to get this. I wish I would have gotten it sooner! It has made our relationship so much better! After 3 weeks, the collar malfunctioned and I had to send it in to Premier. They have great customer service and I am now waiting for a replacement collar (free of charge). I didn't realize how great it was until now - when I don't have it. It has been a LONG few days without the collar. If I try to mimic the sound of the citronella being released by the collar, sometimes he will stop barking, but I'm definitely not a good substitute.

"This is my second purchase of this item and I have to say it is one of the best purchases I've ever made!! We've been using this seat in both of our cars for years and hands down the quality is excellent! The height is just right for a car or SUV, the drawer is nice for stowing potty bags, baby wipes, extra leashes,etc- there is a lot of room in the drawer. This seat will sit two small dogs just fine. The design of the seat to allow for the car seat to be belted in with the seatbelt on the vehicle is fantastic! It's obvious that serious thought went into designing that safety feature. In those moments when you have to suddenly apply your brakes, the car seat WILL stay in place if your car seatbelt is used properly to secure it in place. If you don't use your seatbelt it won't. It's no different than fastening a child car seat. It's just a matter of common sense to belt the product in. I have purchased dog seat belts from a local pet store to use with the car seat and it works perfectly to keep my dogs safe and secure. I highly recommend this care seat- it WONDERFUL!!!",dogs,3
"The Kurgo Backseat Pet Barrier is remarkably effective at keeping my 40-pound, very enthusiastic Portuguese Water Dog out of the front seat. This was critical to me, because my car, a Saab, has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats, and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as I was driving--a rather unnerving experience.As soon as she saw the barrier, my dog didn't even try to wiggle through. It sent a clear message, and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet.The barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat, while simultaneously barring access to the front seat. One caveat--the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror, so I'm planning to remove it. (It unfastens easily.) This product is a great value and will probably last a very long time, owing to its sturdy construction and strong materials. I've owned it for about a month, and couldn't be happier.",cats,2
"We have three cats and a small dog. I hoped that this pet fountain would help keep clean water available for a longer time and that the pets would enjoy drinking from the stream. We only had moderate success with those issues. On the downside, the motor was noisier than I thought and the running water noise was not the pleasant ""water feature"" sound I expected. No matter how we adjusted the flow it sounded like water being poured into a bowl of water.Pros:The fountain doesn't have to be cleaned every day like the old water dish.Two of our cats did enjoy drinking from the running water.The water is not stagnant, so it is aerated more and I expect it is cooler than from a dish.Cons:Still have to clean the unit more than once a week with the animals we have. A water dish is pretty easy to stick in the dishwasher or wash by hand and you're done. Cleaning the Drinkwell is quite a chore and has to be done more often then I thought it would need.It gets more hair and debris the bowl then I expected - and the pump and water flow doesn't keep it sucked up and filtered out. Much of it just sits at the bottom of the bowl.Our dog wanted nothing to do with it, so we had to leave a water bowl out for her. One of the other cats preferred using the dog's water dish. Only two of the cats took to the fountain (and they sometimes would use both).Noisy water pump - not super loud but still loud enough to be annoying. You do tend to tune it out, but I expected no more than just an electric hum.Once, the water grate clogged and caused the bowl to overflow until almost all the resevoir was empty. Good thing we have vinyl floors!Inital cost is pretty expensive. I did save quite a bit by buying it on Amazon rather than at the local Pet store.Replacement resevoirs, which they recommend to be replaced often, are not cheap!Overall I think it performs as claimed. Perhaps my expectations were too high.",cats,2

"I bought this to help train my golden retriever. He has been jumping up on cars that come into the driveway. First, the collar is huge, there has to be a good foot of extra collar - what size dog this is for, I don't know. I am afraid to cut off the excess - afraid the collar will unravel. He chews on the excess. Second, when it is activated he simply turns his head and continues his behavior. By the size it appears to be made for a large dog, but does not give enough oomph for a big dog. I consider this to be a huge waste of money.",dogs,3
"I have tried several pigeon and dove mixes. I find that Hagen Pigeon and Dove Mix is the absolute best. It contains nutritious and delicious ingredients such as millet, milo, whole wheat, canary grass seeds, oats, cracked corn, green split peas, safflower seeds plus vitamin and mineral supplements.Hagen thoroughly washes and then vacuum seals their fresh grains and seeds in a thick, airtight plastic wrap. Unlike some other brands, you will never find bugs, twigs, spider webs, or other nasty debris in their bird food. Their bird food is the most sanitary and immaculately prepared I have ever used. It has the pleasant and sweet aroma of a new harvest.This is the highest quality bird food you can buy. Your birds will love you for feeding them Hagen. They may even think that you've graduated from an avian culinary arts school after you serve them up some healthy and scrumptious Hagen Pigeon and Dove Mix. Chirp chirp coo coo!!",birds,0

"We tried other methods first, including a citronella spray collar, but our insecure mini schnauzer's uncontrollable hysterical barking at other dogs, pedestrians, delivery people down the block, bicyclists passing the house or the car, people in other cars stopped at lights, and for no reason at all was driving us crazy. In desperation, and after reading the many positive reviews, I ordered the PetSafe Bark Control Collar. After just a couple of wearings, the overtime barking was eliminated. It doesn't zing the dog until the 6th bark. Our schnauzer is very bright; she learned so quickly that now all I have to do is show her the collar or ask her if she needs ""her collar"", and she stops barking immediately. The quiet yard, quiet house, and quiet car make this collar a must-have for us. Yes, I was reluctant about possibly hurting my dog, but I tried the zap myself, and while unpleasant, it was quick and mild. If we have workers or guests coming to the house, or the dog is in the car with us, we put the collar on routinely, as insurance against out-of-control barking. She can still give a few warning barks, which is normal for a schnauzer protecting her turf, but we no longer have to waste our breath scolding her for non-stop barking. The PetSafe Bark Control Collar has made life better for her and much more peaceful for us. Highly recommended,",dogs,3

"I've had no problems with the fountain. It works fine. It isn't too hard to clean. The pump works and only makes a little noise that you can't hear unless you go near it and listen for it. But my cat only drinks from it half of the time or less. I don't know why she doesn't like it (it doesn't splash or leak or anything like other reviews had said); she prefers to drink from her regular bowl, though. Possibly she just needs time to readjust. People have suggested that I get rid of the other bowl to make her drink from the fountain. But she will go next to her bowl and meow until I fill it again.",cats,2
"I bought it for my cat for Christmas, ended up giving it to her early haha. Anyway, at first she didn't really know what to do with it, until we secured it onto the inside of a cabinet door.

"My small dogs LOVE this product. It's a bargain at these prices, which you already know if you've purchased it previously at your local store. There's about 15-20 pieces in this package, an equivalent amount that would cost 4 times as much if purchased at a pet store. The few moments of stink this product has disappears and isn't much of a bother. It takes hours for the little chewers to make their way through one pizzle stick, though they work at it diligently and contentedly. Wonderful find!",dogs,3
I have 2 kittens and 1 cat. I used this product on all of them and to my surprise it didn't work that well. It seemed to work the best on my long-haired girl kitten because she stopped scratching for a few days but now has started back. It seemed to reduce the population of the fleas but it didn't eliminate them. And I notice that all of them are scratching their ears now. Maybe they ran in there?I would say this product will probably work better if you treat your entire house and the pets at the same time. I will try this product again because it did work better than the products I bought from the store.,cats,2

Too overpriced and I know come to find out a friend has the very same bed and only paid $20. Ugggghh!",cats,2
"This product is very quiet, considering what it is. It's slightly louder than the ticking of my clock. I don't think there is such a thing as as a pump that's 100 percent silent, but if that's what the people who claim that this item is ""loud"" were expecting, then I can see how they might be disappointed.I have no problem ignoring background noise myself, so even though my fish tank is in my bedroom, I fall asleep easily with the pump on. People who have trouble drowning out such stimuli may not be so fortunate, though I doubt they'll find a quieter alternative.Personally, I give it four out of five stars.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I started using this as a supplement to my show dogs diets when the fish oil capsules got too expensive. They are all doing quite well. Some of the benfits are shiny coats, less dander, even shedding, and healthier skin.

It's guaranteed to work so you can always return it for a refund if it doesn't work for you.",cats,2

We also play with it together, catching the ball and sending it spinning for the other to catch.",cats,2

We live in California where it gets a little toasty in the summer and my little 8 week old Border Collie has been getting so hot when he sleeps his only relief has been sleeping on the cool tile floor with a fan going. We crate train him and I had to take out all his comfy bedding and replace it with loose tiles to help him sleep at night. I looked around and found this bed and it has been awesome. No more panting or fan or tiles. He didn't like it at first as he kept wanting to dig at it, which it held up do his digging until he circummed to the fact it wasn't water or a surface that was going anywhere. Took a couple of times of about 30 minutes before he got used to it and now he loves it. So glad I found this. Keeps him cooler than the tile or fan. I highly recommend trying it.",dogs,3

"I purchased this item to place in the floor of a homemade tub shelter for a stray cat visiting our home.I placed the heater between the bottom of two storage tubs above 1 inch foam insulation with the electric cord exiting a hole in the corner. The entire tub was insulated all around the inner tub, sides and lid. This worked great for 5 months, keeping the internal temperature very nice inside. I am convinced it saved the stray cat's life during a very cold 2011 MN winter.However, during a weekly inspection of the house just last week, I noticed the shelter was very hot inside and the pad overheated and melted the bottoms of both the inner tub and insulation. This was a very dangerous situation as it might have killed the cat and/or started a fire on my deck had it gone unnoticed.",cats,2

I've had the Snuggle Safe for about a month now. My 18 year old cat took to it right away. He has always slept tight to me on cool nights so now I have some room in the bed ;-). He actually seems to be moving around better during the day. I think the heat helps his joints be less stiff. It's advertised for 10 hours of heat but I think it's more like 12. It came with it's own cover and I wrap it in a hand towel to soften it up more. I just ordered a second one for a stray cat that sleeps in a bed I made on my porch. I've been using the self-heating hand warming pouches for him on cold nights so the Snuggle Safe will save me some money. Great product!! I can see numerous other applications - anywhere you needed heat and didn't want to use an electric blanket. I've used it behind MY back a few times and it felt great.,cats,2
"This is my third Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed, my puppy has the small, medium, and large, and each one is perfect for her. She's only had one accident which wasn't a problem because the bed is washable. Keep in mind that regardless of the size it is better to wash by itself and on a delicate cycle. For drying I also dried it on a delicate cycle, which took a little longer, but I didn't want to take a chance of ruining the pet bed.I have all 3 Pet beds one on top of the other in her crate, however when she goes into another room I remove the top bed for her to lay on. She's going to be a large dog so placing all three beds in her crate is perfect give as she grows and gives her a little extra cushion all around and as she gets bigger. Once that happens I'll just remove one pet bed at a time until she too big for multiple pet bed layers; then she'll just have another blanket to go with her bed.Overall, I would definately recommend this ped bed, regardless of your puppy or dogs size; I'm sure they will appreciate it, my puppy does.",dogs,3

"My son owns the original Drinkwell. I saw how much his cat enjoyed it and found the sound of falling water is restful. When I purchased mine I upgraded to the Platinum because of the larger water basin. Unfortunately, since this fountain does not mask the sound of the motor (or they are equipped with cheaper motors) the sound is very annoying. I am going to order an original drinkwell and hope the motor noise is not so loud.",cats,2

However, she runs around with them and will play fetch with them and just loves them. They're an unexpected favorite, I guess!",dogs,3

This experience was very disappointing because instead of following up on my questions and attempts to confirm the order, they just swept me aside and for that lack of customer service, I give them 1 star. I only give them 1 star because this form would not allow me to give them no stars at all.",dogs,3
"I don't know exactly how this compares to a generic glucosamine supplement, but this product came recommended by my vet and it has been great. Almost 1 year ago, my 11 year old (at the time) miniature schnauzer tore his PCL ligament in his knee and needed surgery. Cosequin DS has been a crucial part of his rehabilitation from day 1. I realize he's not a puppy, so it shocked me to see how well he's done over the past few months. He's able to run and play just like before the injury and I am pretty sure that Cosequin has helped along the way. Fr other dog owners who are researching a product for their dog just like I did 1 year ago, you can't go wrong with Cosequin. Sure, its a bit more expensive but a healthy and happy dog is priceless!",cats,2

"When we got a second labrador, the first time I tried to hold both their leashes they pulled me out into the street. I still have scars on my knees. I shouldn't have been surprised - they weigh more than I do, combined (55lbs each - small Labs, really - but I'm a pretty small human). I started dreading a future of taking two walks each time the dogs needed exercise and my husband wasn't around to take one of them.Well, the Gentle Leader meant that future never came. I can walk them by myself, and while sometimes they still pull pretty hard, I've never felt in doubt that I was the one in control. That being said, the dogs hate the Gentle Leader. All the stuff on the package about how the dogs would like it once they're used to it proved utter folly in our case. They shy away when I try to put them on, pout about having them every time they get a chance on the walk, and once I take them off at the end of the walk, they both run over to bed and start scratching their muzzles against the bed. I guess they must really itch? So, I can walk them by myself, which is fantastic - but I do feel terribly guilty putting the dogs in a harness that's so obviously uncomfortable and irritating for them.To me, if you're in a position where the choice is between this product and not walking your dog because you're afraid of being injured, trying the Gentle Leader is a no-brainer. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it, because I'm sure our dogs are not unique in hating how it feels. I only use it when my husband is away - otherwise we use a more traditional harness.",dogs,3

"There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there. My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs. When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry. She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse. I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now. I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.The Wellness food, labeled ""Core,"" is very low carb and both my cats love it! It contains a lot of water (""no more than 78%"" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too. She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic. The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!",cats,2

She had a small wound on the tip of her tail which our vet told us would be difficult to heal because of its placement. He told us that chewing would be bad for the healing. She wanted to chew the spot so we would spray the tail every 12 hours and she stayed off of it. The tail is now healed. We also used it on a screen door that she wanted to chew on and that discouraged chewing as well. In addition she started tearing up the carpet near the tile juncture; spraying worked there, too.

I ordered one and have really been very pleased with the results. The dogs all seem to enjoy it's use on them, and the amount of hair it removes is quite amazing. It is definitely one of my best dog related purchases. I also have to say that Amazon had the best price along with free delivery. Labs Rule!",cats,2

"Beware This Dog Bed! I don't think my Chihuahua likes it much. She hadn't peed in the house for two months or in her bed for three months. I felt she was finally house broken. Then, in less than a week, she peed in this new bed. Yes, the cover is washable. But it's as thin as a pillow-case. What is inside is nothing but a shaped piece of foam with a heater embed in it. In only one week, my Chihuahua puppy has managed to pull hundreds, if not thousands of pieces from the foam without even yet tearing through the cover. When I took the cover off to wash it I had to use a vacuum to get all the pieces of foam off the inside of the cover so they wouldn't clog up my washing machine. Getting the cover back over the molded foam is a project all its own. My puppy hasn't peed in the house again in the few days I've been drying out the hosed down foam mold. We'll see what happens when I try it again one more time. But I wouldn't recommend this bed to anyone. At the very least it needs a heavier shaped cover to prevent a dog from digging through it and to facilitate putting back on after removal.",cats,2
"I gave this one star only because it is unusable in my case. My bobtail cat was highly sensitive to something in this litter and basically just laid around licking her belly all day. The belly fur came off and she just seemed lethargic and miserable to boot. I was about to take her to the vet and thought I'd give litter switch a try as I'd read elsewhere that this litter has affected other cat's in a similar way. Switched to Arm and Hammer and within HOURS not days, the licking stopped. Her hair grew back in a couple of weeks and she started behaving like a happy, little furball again.",cats,2

"My husky pup likes this toy but he only likes to bite the little squirrels and make them squeak. To him it's not so much of a puzzle. As he grows bigger the squirrels are smaller to him and sometimes I am afraid he's going to swallow them. But he still likes to pick them up and squeak them. I'd say if you have a medium or small breed dog it will be a great toy. They held up, to my surprise, since my pup tears up stuffed toys very quickly.",dogs,3

"This bed is a comfy choice for our medium-large mutt (55-60 lb.) and his little sister, a dachshund. It is not quite as large as I thought it would be because of its puffy construction.

"I set up a saltwater tank about 6 months ago and the LFS recommended this hydrometer to me. I was impressed with the accuracy claim so I didn't think twice about shelling out the money for it. When I started using it to check newly mixed water, I kept finding that the salinity level was lower than it should be. 1.020 instead of 1.024 that the water should have came out at. (Instant Ocean Salt Mix) I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. In the end, I discovered with a refractometer that the hydrometer isn't accurate to .001 like it claims. When the hydrometer said my water was at 1.022, the refractometer showed it to actually be 1.027. I lost several hundred dollars in fish due to this piece of junk. Yes, I did rinse it after each use and rinsed it with tank water before each test, and tested twice.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Shortly after purchasing this product, I read an article in a professional journal about counterfeit FURminator deshedding tools being sold on the Internet. This product works great and was delivered on time -- and the price was far better than I could find in my local pet store.

"I've been using this for my dog for just about a year now. For the first 3 1/2 years of his life he had regular bouts of the poops, even though he was getting a premium kibble.

"...but when it didn't, it really sucked. :-( The idea behind this litter box is inventive. It continuously rotates around a rake that sort of acts as an escalator (the best way I can describe it). The poop goes up the escalator, and then falls into a bucket to be dumped later. If this litter box would have worked like it was suppost to, this idea would have been great.The litter box clogs easily. It also isn't very big, so my cat would poop on the very edge. Then the poop would rotate around to the escalator and get stuck to the side of it rather than go up it. When it gets stuck, it makes an awful clicking sound. There really needs to be a safety mechanism that shuts off the box when it gets stuck. Many times the box would get clogged when we were not home to unclog it. There's no telling how long it had been clicking before we got home to fix it.",cats,2
"Since plastic is not a good choice for cats and after having many broken ceramic bowls I was searching for an alternative. Tried the small stainless steel bowls from a local store but they are thin and light so the cats just push them around making a lot of noise and mess. Also a shallow bowl would be better as the cats seem to dislike sticking their faces down into their current bowls. So I was happy to discover that Durapet makes a shallow cat bowl which will fit my needs perfectly. I have owned this product in a large size for dogs for several years and they are sturdy and well made. The dog bowls have been used primarily outside in all temperatures and often washed in the dishwasher but the blue rubber on the bottom, although now lighter colored and a bit dried out, is still intact. Note to other reviewer looking for ceramic bowls made in the USA - Homer Laughlin makers of Fiesta ceramic dishes also makes ceramic pet bowls in the US - but I'm still going with stainless steel because of the durability.",dogs,3

She seems to enjoy the shape, which she can brace with one paw. I bought it because I thought more chewing surface would make it last longer and less likely to break off in larger chunks (and it does seem a little safer than the bone-shaped toys). But since she likes it so much it will actually go quicker! I agree with another reviewer that ""Giant"" is an overstatement here - it could easily be TWICE as thick! Very pleased overall, though, as the price was good too.",dogs,3

Unfortunately, they were dull when I got them, and getting worse every month. I decided to give these a try because the ""safe guard"" feature appealed to me. My dog absolutely HATES having her nails clipped, and I was looking for something that would clip them faster. I have not been disappointed. I have used these clippers for about 2 months now, and they work GREAT! They are sharp, so they cut quickly and easily, and I have not cut my dog's nails to the quick once. I have a treeing walker coonhound with fairly large paws, so this size nail trimmer works great. I have already recommended them to friends. Also, I priced around, and found that Amazon's price was excellent.",dogs,3
"I just ordered my second Petsafe continuous clean litter box, after my first one finally broke down after 2 years of continuous use. I have 2 cats and would clean out the box a couple of times a week, laying down some bicarb in the bottom of the clean baggie to absorb any smells. I NEVER had to do a complete litter change - just top it up with fresh litter every time I changed the collection baggie. Recently I looked after my fiance's diabetic cat for a few weeks, and he pees about 10 - 12 times a day...and a lot of pee at one time, making big long clumps that would get stuck, instead of the small round clumps my own kitties produce. I was having to empty the box twice a day instead of twice a week with just the addition of this one cat. Unfortunately, I guess I was tardy emptying it one day and something got caught in the mechanism and caused the gears in the small motor compartment to start sliding and then to consequently overheat. As I was away at work, I did not hear the tell-tale clicking sound until about 14 hours later, and by that time, the gears had worn themselves out with the continual sliding and the motor was very hot. I took the whole thing apart, but couldn't fix it - the problem being in the sealed motor housing :( Fiance's cat sadly passed away, so I think it's safe to now order a new one for my two kitties. 4-stars because it works like a dream for my two cats, BUT I was hoping for it to last longer. I suspect the gears are made of plastic and became distorted even more when the motor overheated - We will have a post-mortem when I receive my new one and see if it can be salvaged/repaired and donated to my elderly Uncle Jim, who has 4 cats and struggles with their litter boxes. Not recommended if you have a diabetic cat! Oh, and if Petsafe can please, please come up with some sort of cover for it, that would be heavenly!! I am thinking of re-modelling the dome from my old bhudda-dome litter box and see if that works.",cats,2
"In my estimation, the Premier Squirrel Dude is the best designed treat filled toy. The plastic is strong enough to withstand strong and extensive chewing and the hole which has three little teeth (that can be trimmed if necessary) keeps all kinds of kibble treats from just falling out. With other toys like this I had to resort to expensive fillers or high fat substances (like peanut butter) to keep our Jack Russell from emptying the toy too quickly.",dogs,3
"Anytime Amazon has these bags on sale I stock up. They usually fall into the free shipping program which is also great. I live in condos and I also take my dogs hiking and camping and out walking the neighborhoods. So everywhere we go is common areas and I clean up after my pets. It's easy to grab a roll and tuck it into a pocket. It's better to use these bags because a lot of times the bags you bring your groceries in have holes in them and don't work for doggie duty. I recommend these bags to all pet owners. Better pricing than you will find in any store and they are very sturdy. Also, the darker blue color makes your dog's waste less obvious.",dogs,3

"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do. My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy. Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life. After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian. Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications. I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy. His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight. I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after. To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results. If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would be almost nothing.",dogs,3

My dog took a little while to warm up to it, but now he just loves the food! I love the fact that it's holistic food and very good for him and even his stool looks so much healthier. I gave him the option of eating two different kinds of food, Eukanuba and Azmira. He prefers the Azmira so much more! I have recently switched to it 100% since the transition is done and I'm very satisfied with the results. Great dog food!",dogs,3

I'm sure there are other brands out there that are good but Royal Canine is easy to feed for puppies and small dogs because they are little pebbles. Very distinct smell and healthy.

"Our headstrong, stubborn, rescue rat terrier - responded wonderfully to this product. The different levels of shock have a good range for the most sensitive dog to pretty darn stubborn. I strapped it under my forearm and tested the levels to check the sensation before putting it on our incessant barker, yapper, jumper and newly self appointed pack leader. Level 1) felt like putting your tongue on a 9V battery as a kid everyone did that right? , 2 felt like a sharp pin prick, 3) hurts and feels like a shock, 4) is quite painful - as in OMG make it stop! Our little fella responded to level 2 without a fuss or a yelp and after a few experiences of it - responds to the ""bad tone"" as a warning and ceases the undesired, barking, yapping and nipping our other well behaved dogs. In 2 days he was like a new, well behaved dog - without losing any of his sparkle. Highly recommended over the no bark automatic collars - to break stubborn habits. The range of the remote to the collar is very good. The dvd enclosed with the product recommends this for teaching basic commands - I feel it is a bit over the top - buy a clicker and train basic commands by positive re-enforcement, this will build a better relationship between you and your dog. But if your dog is putting itself in danger or your neighbors are complaining about barking - this is an excellent device for new behavior.",dogs,3

"There are very few toys that keep my dogs entertained. Usually they like the packaging more. But this is a stimulating toy. Watch carefully when they play however because my big dog does like to tear the paws off the squirrels, so it's better not to leave them alone with it unless you put the squirrels up and just let them play with the tree. (For some reason it's almost as fun for them.) The thing that is nice about it is that one of the dogs like the squirrels alone, another likes pulling the squirrels out of the tree stump, and the third likes the stump by itself. The tree stump is very durable, but the squirrels could be ingested by dogs who like to eat their toys that are stuffed and squeak. I'm hoping someday that they will make one out of the Tuffy Toy kevlar fabric.",dogs,3

He literally made himself bleed on walks around the yard trying to pull it off with his paws. He got himself so worked up that I had a hard time getting him to settle down just to get it off of him. My husband tried it with him also and it just seemed inhumane to us. Our Jack Russell hated it also but I do think she could get used to it. I guess it would probably work better with puppies. I'll be selling them at my next garage sale or on amazon!",dogs,3

"I have used this product for a month and LOVE it! Time is of the essence in my household so I don't worry about cleaning litter every day, washing litter pans and all the mess that goes with it. This product does everything for you except put the container in the trash. My two cats are happy, they have a clean space everytime they need to go, I'm happy - I don't have to clean up after them daily and put up with the smells. When the plastic container is 3/4 full, you just snap the top on, lift it out and put it in the garbage. Nice neat package. To clean the pan you just flick two clasps on the side, it drops down, you dump the remaining litter, give it a swish with disinfectant, dry, reattach and fill with fresh litter. I LOVE this product and having cats is a lot more fun now! The machine also seems to run very well. Some people complain about the noise (which is not very loud) but I think it's a beautiful sound!!",cats,2

But hey, when I look at the destruction he's inflicted on the scratch pad and realize that it could have been my furniture, this thing was definitely worth it. He doesn't play with the ball in the track all that much except when he's high on the cat nip or having one of his berserk/wide-eyed cabin-fever moments.

"I see many reviewers claiming that their cat has broken into this feeder quickly and easily. Admittedly, my cat broke in within 5 minutes of being shown the new dish. She's smart and strong but I couldn't believe that the unit was so poorly built. Further investigation revealed that the timer wasn't snapped firmly down onto the tabs in the base. It takes a little wiggling to get the slots on the timer lined up with the tabs in the base. Once aligned you have to push down pretty hard to make the tabs snap into place. Now my cat, strong as she is, can't spin the cover to get to the next meal!",cats,2
"I may get down voted for the first mediocre review, but hopefully my outcome is atypical to the normal user experience. I felt I had to share my experience.As a background. I found some week old kittens about 9 days ago. Their mom, I found out later, was eaten by a fox. They were underweight and cold when I found them (four of them).I ended up nursing them all back to health on a competitor's kitten food. They get very healthy, and were growing fast. I then ordered this on Amazon because it was ten dollars at the time, which was cheaper than the stuff I had gotten at the store here.Well, the good news is, the cats loved the taste. They dove right in and ate a lot. The bad news...every single one of them over the past two days has gotten the explosive poops. It started with just one of them, so I thought he was sick, but all of them started getting wet poop eventually, with the larger kittens getting it later.Wet poops aren't even the problem, but they keep soiling themselves inside their crib. I don't know if it's because when they crawl it stimulates their BM reflex, or if their small anus' can't keep in the vegetable oil that's in the product. At any rate, I've gone through a lot of sheets. They aren't ready to litter train yet, so I'm kind of in s stuck position.I may be able to chalk this up to a bad batch, but I would definitely be wary about giving this to kittens that are already healthy on something else. I am going out right after this review to purchase the old stuff I had them on, as I am tired of spending hours a day cleaning off caked poop off of my kittens. Being a mama cat is no fun in that regard.Hope this helps, and I pray no one else has had this problem.EDIT 5/19/2012The kittens are three and a half weeks old now. After switching them back to the other formula and using kaopectate, I was able to calm down all their angry innards. After research, I found out it is sometimes dangerous to change a kitten's diet suddenly like that. I am starting to acclamate them to the new formula, slowly mixing more and more into their current brand.So, this was partially my fault. But, I also noticed this stuff is a lot thicker than the other formula I use, making it harder for the kittens to suckle efficiently. They sometimes get visually frustrated with that.08/06/2012Final update. I was right, a couple people didn't appreciate the review. But that's alright, I stand by it. The kittens did a lot better on the Wal-Mart brand of formula. I even tried the KMR second step stuff, and that did even worse. I ended up buying some micro pellets of dry food, and they took to that instantly after two weeks of trying to get them to eat the KMR stuff (this was a couple months ago).Since then, I'm proud to update all of the kittens that were alive as of the last update are now in great homes. I still think this brand, for whatever reason, almost killed off my entire litter. Try cleaning up caked on kitten poop for a week. I spent many hours with a warm bowl of water and a tooth brush.So, if it works for you, great. But I would still suggest not switching to this if you have them healthy on something else. For me, it was a very bad experience. Whether or not it works better if you start them on this...that is to be decided (when I found the starved little kitties, I didn't have the luxury to wait on Amazon, even with prime delivery).",cats,2

my little dogs chew every toy to pieces but not these! They love carrying them around like a bone and chewing them. These even bounce a bit when thrown. The money is well worth it and the manufacturer will replace once for free if your dog does ruin it.,dogs,3
"I bought this litter box because my mother who has a bad back. She had a ""lift and sift"" type box which was fine, but it was hard to bend and lift.The Litter Robot scared her at first. She doesn't like ""technical"" things. But, she read through the instructions and set it up with no problems.Luckily, the cats like the box, too. She has three cats and all of them acclimated to it quickly and with no troubles.Not having to buy special containers for waster or special litter is wonderful. I did lots of research before choosing which automatic litter system I wanted and I am sure I made the right decision. I highly recommend the Litter Robot. I can't think of one negative thing to say about it.",cats,2

"Live in New Hampshire and use this product on my dog religiously once a month. Even so, she still contracted the tick borne illness called anaplasmosis which was life-threatening (generalized bleeding due to low platelets). All the tick needs is 24 hours or so to infect a dog.To be fair, I have used this same product on 3 other dogs over the last 15 years and have never had one test positive for any tick borne disease. So I guess the lesson here is not that this product is ineffective but just that it still pays to physically check your dog for ticks whenever he/she has been outside because no product is 100% effective at preventing tick borne diseases.",dogs,3
"The product is excellent, I have a white Mini Schnauzer and could no get rid of the black stains around his eyes as well as some of the hairs on the chin,I used all the products I found as well as home remedies but nothing worked, after a week using Angel Eyes all begin to change and now after a month of use all black hairs and dark spots are almost gone, I recommend it to any one that has a problem like the one i had.",dogs,3
"A good friend of mine recommended this box and the reviews seemed so wonderful that I was actually oddly excited to recieve this product. Unfortunately, when I set it up the front latch did not close properly at all and litter spilled out the sides, all over my floor. I'm just glad I was able to return this. I am sure if it was better constructed it would be great since the idea of the roll scoop system seems great, but the poor construction makes it a terrible product.",cats,2
"We purchased one of these yesterday evening at approximately 6:30 p.m. By 9:00, it was completely destroyed. This does not match my definition of ""tough"" and ""long-lasting""--as advertised on the packaging. Very disappointed in this product.",dogs,3
"My daughter had gotten this item from her vet and she got me a tub for my two dogs, an airedale (13yrs old) and a coon hound (14yrs old). My airedale, Sassy, was having a lot of trouble getting around due to arthritis and spent most of her time on the living room floor unable to get up sometimes without assistance. My coonhound had more mobility. Once I started them on the program, I saw results on Sassy within days. She is now able to get up onto the sofa and gets up without assist now and is more mobile than she was before. My coonhound also gets around a little better than she could before. She now can get up into the truck whereas before, she was having trouble.The price was right on this product. When I got it from the Vets, I paid 50$ just for the small tub.I will continue using this product for my dogs.",dogs,3

"The body is pretty big, but my dog likes to swing and drag it by the tail. The sound it makes is crazy---almost like a weird baby doll instead of a ""squeak""! The dog jumped back the first couple of times he bit it and got the sound, but loves it now.",dogs,3
"We had been looking at the Snoozer Console for quite a while, but were turned off by the price. Amazon offered the same Snoozer for about half the price as we had seen other places.

"I am owned by a rambunctious, precious, spoiled and slightly psychotic Shitzu. And this is one of the best gifts I've given her.You twist open the two pieces (like a big, purple, rubber Oreo cookie) and then fill it up with small treats. I use flat disc type treats but the great thing is that you can adjust the opening for any style of bite-size rewards. This is also good so that you can start out by letting one fall out when you roll it across the floor, let the dog know what's inside, and then take it back and twist it a little tighter so that they now have to work a little harder for them.. Happy torture!It's very durably constructed for a small dog but I don't know about bigger breeds. All I know is that my dog loves it.",dogs,3
"Good litter boxes. I do have a couple of comments, however. The motor on the LM900's, although quieter than the first LitterMaids manufactured, stop working in about 12 -18 months. The second comment is about the new model, Elite Mega Advanced. LitterMaid has changed the dimensions so that it doesn't fit in the 3rd party market cat box furniture (at least I can't find any). This is a real nuisance since the cat box ""containers"" LitterMaid provides (tents, cabanas etc) are not very substantial, hard to clean or don't last. When this cat box dies, probably in about 12- 18 months, and I can't find another LM900 or one with the same dimensions from LitterMaid, I will probably buy a different brand, rather than invest in a new piece of cat furniture.I do love LitterMaid litter. It is the best. My cats used to track litter, even with the ramp, and the premium litter would get ""sticky"", not rake very well and it was a major effort to clean the litter box. LitterMaid litter has little to no dust, it doesn't get sticky and no more tracking. It also makes the litter box much easier to clean. Great litter.",cats,2

"I have a Rottweiler, and this is by far her favorite ball.

"If your neighborhood squirrels are like mine, the kind who crawl up into cars to snack on wires and rubber,the kind who thwart all baffles to eat the seed in your bird feeders, then you might want to use this toy for a little retribution. Poetic justice would be to stick it on a tree branch and pelt it with acorns. Our dogs, however, won't allow such play. The squirrel is theirs to chew on, pounce on, and fetch.Piper, the shih tzu squirrel chaser, particularly likes this toy. She took to it immediately and carried it around the house proudly like a prize. The toy is safe for Piper and her puppy sister because it has no buttons or hard plastic pieces for nose or eyes. With a fluffy, soft tail this squirrel dog toy does a good job masquerading as a real squirrel and the internal squeaker adds to the fun.I'm not sure how long-lived these pseudo squirrels may be. Probably depends on the number of chews endured and the number of washings necessitated by accumulated slobber. With each washing the squirrel is a little less fluffy and a little more matted. No matter. The girls enjoy their little squirrel toy. Its modest cost is well worth seeing such canine joy.",dogs,3
"Had the item working for 2 weeks without a problem. The cat left a larger than usual package in the litter and the self cleaning bar stopped without moving the litter. The line that attaches the bar to the engine snapped and I now have a litter box with a self cleaning bar mid-way through the box. Needless to say, this is a waste of money.",cats,2
I purchased this kennel to crate train an adopted dog with seperation anxiety. After less than a month the dog was able to break the lower lip where the door sits and escape. After contacting pet mate they said the warrenty doesnt cover crate training a dog only a dog that is already trained. Tough break. I bought another one at petsmart for cheaper as well.,dogs,3

"I have seen some of the negative reviews and honestly I am not having the problems with these that other people have. I have an adopted Aussie who requires about 2 hours of exercise per day. These are his absolute favorite toys. We throw them, abuse them, hose them off and dry them in the sun, etc. and they just keep lasting and lasting. Plus, they make a great training tool. I have neighbors with untrained dogs who get at the fence and bark, and I can easily redirect my Aussie to ignore them just by squeaking one of these. I have purchased tennis balls from PetCo and PetSmart and have had problems with those falling apart (the cardboard on the inside collapses). The only other option would be Chuck-Its, which seem to last a pretty long time, but they are heavier and my active, leaping dog prefers the lighter Kongs for catching and retrieval. My dog doesn't chew on these, just plays with them and squeaks them, so I suppose that is why they are lasting so long for us. So I would say these are great for retrieval and play, not so great for dogs who like to chew.",dogs,3
"After dog #5 and #6 was left to fend for themselves at my gate it became to expensive to use Heartguard along with flea and tick control. I switched to Advantix (I used frontline for years with great success against fleas and ticks) because it repels mosquitos and flies as well as fleas and ticks. I thought if mosquitos aren't biting my dogs will have less change of contracting heartworms. Because I live in the middle of the woods we are plagued by mosquitos, ticks and deer fly. After appyling Advantix the deer flies do not swarm my dogs. I think it works with the mosquitos, but I never really saw them on my dogs before. Only down fall is it may fall a little short of 30 days. I have found an occasional tick when it's near the time to retreat.",dogs,3

"I don't typically have to buy flea things but recently, I've moved to SoCal and there are SO many fleas down here! This shampoo not only smells good, but I could see the fleas falling off of my pug in the bath. It's a little soupy but works well and smells great. It's not a really strong smell but rather a faint smell. Honestly, I much prefer this smell to that of a wet dog. Also, my pugs lady parts were raw and red, after washing it with this (since it has oatmeal I assume), it's all cleared up and there's no itching. I'd buy this again in the future for the smell and quality alone.On a side note, you can't beat the price. It's way more expensive in store.",dogs,3

I wouldn't pay the 20.00 eheim sells for.( 8- cost and 12 shipping. Be real.)Overall though, 4 stars.

"I have trained dogs in obedience for several years. Lupine makes the best training collars on the market! I have used them on a variety of dogs - Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Schnauzer. I recently adopted a Jack Russell Terrier from our local humane society and of course obedience class was the first thing on the agenda for him. I did not have a Lupine the correct size so I started him in class with another brand. Even though it was a martingale type, I quickly realized that it wasn't going to work. He only weighs 12 pounds, but he was out of control. I ordered this collar and it made a huge difference. Almost immediately, he was staying in heel position and when he wasn't he was easy for me to guide back there. Lupine collars are very humane. Choke collars can damage a dogs throat, but the martingale style of the Lupine gives firm but gentle pressure around the dog's entire neck. It allows you to control a dog that lunges and they quickly learn to respond to the leash and walk with you with no protest. I particularly like the feature that allows you to slip the collar over the dog's head without having to deal with the plastic snap buckles that are common today. I always pinch my fingers while trying to use those, especially with a dog that won't stand still. The Lupine collars come in a variety of sizes to fit all size dogs. They come in all sorts of colors and designs as well. Lupine collars are durable and will last a lifetime. Lupine products come with a guarantee - if your dog chews through one, Lupine will replace it. If you need a good, durable and effective collar, buy Lupine!",dogs,3
"Our friend's dog Charlie always loved to come over and hang out in our garden- until last 4th of July. People were shooting off fireworks all over the neighborhood, and he got so terrified from the lights and the noise, eventually we had to take him inside. After that day, every time he'd come into our garden, he'd tremble and cower with his tail between his legs. I hoped that the DAP spray would help, and I was not disappointed. I sprayed a little around the patio, and he instantly went to it and smelled deeply. Then he laid down near it, and relaxed the whole evening! No more cowering, no more trembling, no more stress. Wonderful stuff, highly recommended!",dogs,3
"I bought this for my betta tank, but in pink and a little spikier petals, and it looks very nice! The flower part is right below the surface of the water in my tank, and bettas love to lay on and in things right at the surface, so I find him there in his flower constantly throughout the day resting. It's well made, I like the gravel bowl base a lot, and it's very easy to clean. The plastic isn't rough or hard, so it won't cut your fish's fins. Very happy with this product.",fish aquatic pets,4
"At first, when we tossed the ball it flashed and buzzed for 1-2 seconds, then turned off. If our dog wasn't fast enough we ended up playing search in the dark. That's how it worked for about 10 throws. Then, suddenly, we threw it again and it stayed on longer...much longer. Permanently, in fact. After 10 full minutes of being stuck on the same single sound and flashing constantly, I found the tab that activates the toy and stuck it back in its slot (with some difficulty) and the ball turned off. Now if I remove the tab, which you must do to play with it, it turns on instantly and doesn't stop...ever.This is the second one of these we tried, the first didn't work at all. I assumed the batteries were dead, now I'm not so sure.10 years ago I bought a flash ball similar to this. A little bigger, no noise, about the same price. Light would flash for about 10 seconds, which was plenty of time for a dog to retrieve it and even return it to you. Lasted me about 6 years before the battery died, and that was with constant use. Every dog owner I knew had one. You could find them at any pet store. Well, now they can't be found. Discontinued sometime in the last 3 years. Can't imagine why and it boggles the mind that technology has actually taken a backwards step in the last decade. I was hoping I had found a suitable replacement. Unfortunately, no. I'll be returning this Chinese-made P.O.S. to the store.",dogs,3

"I had to write a review for this wonderful brand of dog food when I saw that no one gave it the credit it so richly deserves. Natures Variety Instinct is completely grain free and made from 95% meat and 5% assorted oils (like olive oil and fish oil), vegetables, fruits, and vitamins/minerals. I was a loyal follower of Canadie dog food for years until they decided to change their formula and increase their amounts of grains being used. Then the reports came in stating that so many dogs were getting sick over it. I was at a loss until I came across this line of dog food from a small manufacturing group. The reviews I read online were phenomenal and I decided to try it. I have a baby long-haired Chihuahua that absolutely loves this food. It doesnt give her an upset stomach, nor does it make her stools runny. She only has to eat a very small amount because its so nutrient packed. Her coat looks lustrous and her eyes sparkle. I decided to use the chicken meal formula because it offered a higher protein intake compared to the other instinct dry food options., but all of them offer the same fat intake and omega-3&6. It may not have the fancy commercials and the marketing campaign of more well known dog foods like Purina, but it more then makes up for it by making a product of exceptional quality.",dogs,3

"I have a boxer that is always tryin to run off, get in trash, or just run the house. I bought this with hopes that it would help with the training and get her under control. I have been using it for a few months now and it has help some. I did have to set it on the hightest setting and sometimes it still does not work, but it has made a difference. I like that the collar has a beep sound along with the virbration. I guess the biggest problem I have with the collar is the range.. I would like the range to be greater.. our dog had a bad habbit of running off to either our neighbors down the road or the neigbors behind us that is behind a wooded area, once she gets so far the collar does not work. we try to keep her in our yard but sometimes she gets gone before we know it..So yeah the collar works and it does help with the training but I would like a greater range on the collar..",dogs,3

These treats are really small in size. They are great for training. You can give your dog several of these without worrying about him over eating. Amazon's price was much more reasonable than any other retailer. You can buy a 1 pound bag on Amazon for almost the same price as a 6 ounce bag at other retailers.

I have a 20 gallon fish tank with six fishes(kois and goldfish) and I wanted a fish feeder for when I go on vacation which is normally about ten days. I used this item and it worked perfectly. You just have to program it for the time of day you want the fish to be fed and it can feed up to two feedings at a time . What happens is the drum just makes two rotations and drops the food. Setting up the feeder is like programming your digital watch so just follow the instructions and all will be fine but dont lose the paper. I t also works with batteries so you dont have to worry about power outages......just what I wanted,fish aquatic pets,4

"I bought this because my dog loves to chase thrown objects, but gets bored once they hit the ground. I thought that a constantly moving ball like this would be fun for her. Unfortunately, she is not interested in this at all in fact, when the motor is running she gets scared.I tried getting 4 other of my families dogs to play with this with no luck. Their reactions varied from ignoring it to being afraid. All of these dogs are small 10-15lb dogs, the ball is fairly small, so size should not be the issue, but it does create a fair amount of noise when running.I am sure if you have a very energetic dog that is not easily frightened this would be great, but for my dogs it is no good.",dogs,3

"I've bought quite a few aquarium filters over the years (Eheim, Rena Xp) and am always looking for a good buy. I always over filter my tanks. I've also found the 3-5 stage canister filters to be a solid choice for any size aquarium. The more baskets you have the better the biological, mechanical and chemical filtration you will have.You can always adjust the output flow to match your tank. I purchased this Cascade 1000 for use on two of my smaller tanks. A 30 and 40 gallon. The filter provides 3 baskets, flow adjustments and all kinds of configuration options. I paid $80 for this filter delivered from Monster Pets. At this price point what really impressed me were the simple convenience items. The filter has a nice handle to carry it. Flexible dark colored vinyl hose with connectors that allow flow control. It also came with multiple sections for spray bar and a nozzle. The supplied media include sponges, floss and charcoal. The filter took about 15 minutes to install and with a few pushes of the primer it was pumping water. The only improvement I could think of is the addition of some bio-media. This is a solid well constructed filter. It's Eheim quality at one quarter the price.",fish aquatic pets,4

"our dog got this and went chewing right at the black stitching and got it ripped open in 10 minutes..we took it away...gave it to her again a few days later she went right after the black stitching on the other side in 10 minutes..she is 85 lb 2 year old lab...what can we say..she is too hard core for this ""hard core"" toy...it is OK but did not last nor was strong enough to be worth buying again...do not be fooled by claims of ""indestructible"" or ""chew proof""",dogs,3
I don't trust this conditioner because it was as thick as honey and didn't distribute properly through the water. I had globs of it floating in the tank. Maybe I just got an old bottle.,fish aquatic pets,4
I got this product to help my dog with his separation anxiety. I put peanut butter inside of it and give it to him as I'm leaving the house. He licks the peanut butter out and then doesn't play with the ball after that. I don't usually let him continue playing with this treat dispensing toys after the treat is gone....so I'm happy that he stops playing with it once the peanut butter is gone. It seems like a durable toy even for dogs that would continue to play after getting the treat.,dogs,3
I just love these pet paws and chime. My Havanese has been using them since we got him. He lets us know when he wants out and I have one at each door outside so he also lets us know when he wants in.

Bought this item on Amazon.com Shipping was very quick!

Well worth it!,bunny rabbit central,1
"I had a parrot for about 5 years. Now he lives with family members who give him lots of attention and love him as much as I loved him. Sometimes I like to ""treat"" him still with food, treats and toys every so often. He has always thrived and never been sick (with the exception of a couple of colds in the past eight years). He has beautiful feathers. Since he was a baby, he has always loved these Nutri-Berries, which have been his main staple. This is the stuff he has been eating for years, and it is his favorite. He loves to eat lots of different treats and people-food as well, but these and the Nutri-Nuts from the same company are his favorite parrot foods. He goes absolutely crazy for these! This is a great deal, and with free shipping it cannot be beat! The product itself costs a little more at the pet store. In addition to saving money on the product, buying this here online saves you the cost of the gas it takes to drive to the store to buy it. I totally recommend! A+++++",birds,0
I thought I would give these a try as my rats love yogurt and so I got these as they are easy to give to your rats without getting a new yogurt open and feeding it to them (which they still get occasionally). My rats loved these so much that when feeding them they grab my fingers with their hands so they can get the yogurt drop quicker. If you have rats that enjoy yogurt then they will go crazy for these. It says to only give them 1 or 2 a day but you will feel guilty leaving their cage side as they keep coming back wanting more.,small animals,5
"I initially owned one of these back when I had my 55 gallon aquarium. It took some practice to change out the cartridge but I got used to it.For awhile I stopped with the aquarium hobby and actually gave this filter away, when I got back into it I started trying out other filters. Nothing else compared. I even owned the next size up intended for 75 gallon aquariums that sat under the tank. It turned out to be quite the headache. De-pressurizing and re-pressurizing the canister was a pain. It was so big and the replacement media was so expensive to own (this is for the 75 gallon filter).So I immediately switched back to my 55 HOT Magnum.First off, this filter is great for the ability to customize the media inside. It provides ample storage for your carbon media (or whatever type of solid media you want to you). It has excellent flow as well.Second, maintenance is relatively cheap. The replacement pads last a good deal amount of time if you soak them in bleach water (and then dechlorinate prior to addition). I rotate between two of them and I get an extended use. Carbon can be expensive if you go with a good brand, but you don't necessarily have to.Third, it's a hang on the tank filter. You don't see it. It doesn't generate a lot of noise. You can change the angle of the output to provide great surface breakage to help add additional oxygen to the water.I have never tested the BIO-Wheel attachment on this nor do I have any input on it.",fish aquatic pets,4

The spacing between the teeth is just right...and you have two choices, depending on the coarseness of the coat and the size of the knot. The comb is also long and sturdy enough to comb the coat out and run your trimmer along the comb for a straight cut.

I purchased the Scoopfree 'free' litter trays from mail order. These were the original brown trays that do not leak urine. However the white (free)litter that is packaged with them is not great. I only have one cat and it did not last long at all without replacement. The second order I chose the white 'premium crystal' litter trays. While the litter is much better the trays are horrible. The urine soaked through and was all over the floor underneath the trays. So my choice was to go back to the brown tray with substandard litter or find an alternative. I was able to find a permanent tray from [...] I just replaced another 'premium' urine soaked tray with this product. While some may find it a little inconvenient to dump the tray and refill I think its a small price to pay for the environment and not cleaning urine off the floor.I am very unhappy with ScoopFree's customer service. I emailed to cancel my delivery subscription due the problems with the trays. They did not respond with any type of condolence. They just said they would be charging me $20 for early cancellation.

Takes a little getting used to and adjusting, but once set up, it is pretty easy to put in place and remove, and does the job of preventing dogs from climbing up to the front to help you drive.

"2 stars because it worked last year....had this been my first experience, it would have received 1 star.I used this exact same product last year on 7 cats and one 25# dog. I buy this size because it's cheaper than buying a bunch of convenience doses. I just make certain that I get the correct dose by weight of animal. Last year, it worked really well. It took about 4 weeks to really see a huge impact, but it controlled the problem.This year, we have 6 indoor cats, 2 outdoor cats (sometimes 4) and a 25# dog.... I started them on it earlier because our insect season started earlier...no effect! After 2 doses and waiting 9 weeks total, there was an increase in flea population. I would blame it on the two of us humans, but my spouse reacts BAADLY to flea bites and doesn't get lazy when it comes to cleaning as a preventative! He looks like someone beat him with a flail....and the itching drives him loopy!! We don't have rugs, ALLLL wood floor, NOTHING with upholstery or fabric except our bed. He uses diatomaceous earth dust on the floors, then vacuums that up, followed by mopping with bleach and flea shampoo. That he did on a daily or every other day basis....to no avail! The animals were still infested. I actually shaved the dog because she chewed her rump bloody!!!After giving the second dose a couple weeks to work, I ordered Advantage II. That arrived, and we waited until it was time to do the third dose (we didn't want to overdose anyone). We can see the difference already! We have a litter of new kittens that we gave a flea bath to and immediately were reinfested with adult fleas....after dosing their mother with the new Advantage II, there are not any adult fleas visible on her babies!Don't know what happened with the Frontline??

"The instruction sheets for programming the timer can use a major rewrite as it is very confusing (must be written in China as well :). Other than that, the unit seems to be working just fine.It uses 3 D batteries. The batteries go at the bottom of the unit to keep it stable. You can have the unit dispense 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner), each with its own time setting. The meal size is the same for all feeding programs. The whole thing feels well-made and stable enough. It's a little more expensive than those rotary feeders (which can only hold a maximum of 6 meals), but it's a much better feeder due to the 3-meal-per-day feature (it doesn't care about how many days).I'm glad I went with this feeder.

"We were a little nervous at first, as one of our pups is a runner, but after plenty of research, we decided to purchase the PetSafe Deluxe. Installing was not too bad, we used an edger, approximately 250 feet in total. We did not upgrade to the thicker wire, but did take precautions in areas where the fence would be regulary driven over (put the wire inside a plastic tube, then inside the ""trench"". It has been about 4 weeks, and no issues yet. The instructions on training were very detailed, however did not work for our dogs. Once our skittish terrier got zapped while on the leash, she was over it, and just layed down, wouldn't walk anymore. So, we had the flags up, and let them go - we had to inrease the range to about 7 and have only had a few instances of getting through, but they are getting used to where the fence is, and are now able to be unsupervised. GREAT investment, they are so much happier now!!",dogs,3

"Nothing's perfect, especially kitty litter. We've tried many different kinds including World's Best (which smelled really horrible), Sweatscoop, and pea pod varieties. Thankfully, our two cats are rather flexible and adapted very quickly to the Feline Pine pellets after we tried the scoopable version first and decided it tracked just as bad as the others (one of our main contentions with litter, the other being smell upon urination). These pellets really absorbs urine oder, but you do need to scoop out the solid waste a little more frequently since they have difficulty burying it. Tracking is very minimal. The fact that no strip mining (like for clay litter) and no offensive perfumes means that it's a little more environmentally friendly than many commercial litters. Biodegradability is also a bonus, though I can't speak for flushability since my apartment managers strictly forbid flushing litter of any kind.",cats,2

"I am leaving my original review just so you know I am not knocking the product entirely. I was happy at first, things have changed.Original review:When I first looked at this, I thought it was an expensive toy for people who have too much money! I was wrong, it ended up being a great purchase. We have two cats that just wouldn't drink out of their water dish. We tried all kinds of things to get them to drink water (I read about the health problems cats get if they don't drink enough) with no luck. I finally broke down and bought this. They love it! The water tank on the back holds a nice reserve of water, it is filtered constantly, and the running water captures their attention.I really can't say anything bad about this unit. If I were to make a suggestion on how it could be improved, I would say to add a spare filter in the box....but I am not complaining! Well worth the price.UpdateAfter owning the fountain for a year, it started developing a bad habit of draining all the water in the tank which, unfortunately, overflows the basin. The first time it happened, I blamed myself thinking I hadn't put the cap on properly, hadn't placed it properly, whatever. But after it happened several more times, each time with less time between failure, I figured the unit was the problem.In my mind there is a very serious design flaw with this unit. The tank doesn't have a gasket and a spring on the water release. This tends to make a mess when refilling and it can lead to problems as I described above. The sad thing is Drinkwell could fix this problem for another $.25 per unit if that much!The unit I purchased is the landfill now and I will not be purchasing a replacement until I find a better design.I still think the concept is great, and if properly built, would be well worth having. Maybe the next generation of the Drinkwell will be better....",cats,2
"My cockatiels space heater had died after 4 years of use. I liked the space heater as it was capable of low power use and would run it for 8-10 hours at a time due to the fact the bird is in a large room and winter night temperatures especially with snow are very cold. After the heater died I bought another thinking it would be the same. I was dead wrong as the electric bill jumped over 150$ in one month due to the power consumption of the new heater. I even timed my electric meter with the new space heater on and off. It sent the usage disk spinning.With winter quickly coming up I looked into other methods of heating such as a heat blanket someone recommended. However all the heat blankets at the local store had a two hour shut off time due to safety issues. I looked into more economical space heaters on line such as ones that use oil but they cost 100$ or more for good ones that will last for years.After extensive research I came across the Zoo Med Repticare Bulbs. I opted for the 60 Watt bulb since I didn't know how hot it would be. I also picked up the Zoo Med Deluxe 8.5in Porcelain Black Clamp Lamp for Reptiles. The 60 Watt bulb gives off light steady heat to about 1 foot away tops. Since my bird is an open cage bird and spends her day both inside, outside and on top of her cage, I keep the bulb about 8in away from the cage. If your bird is strictly an inside cage bird then you could probably put the bulb 2-3in away just outside the cage.At night I wrap most of the cage except for the side quarter of it where the heat bulb is. I also aim the bulb slightly down so the heat will get her feet and rise over her body as well. If you have a larger cage and a larger bird and your house gets to be around 50-60 degrees at night then I would probably spring for the 100 Watt Bulb. The bulb also warms her blanket on the cage making it a very comfortable atmosphere overall.The bulb of course gets hot to the touch, it uses far less electricity than even my now dead economical space heater did and is great for constant heat (10-12 hours or more) in large rooms that often stay cold during winter time. Due to the fact the bulb doesn't give off light, make sure you turn it off as you won't notice it is on unless you get somewhat close and feel heat nearby.Even though my bird is quite nervous and cautious to new things and strangers I found her sleeping as close as possible to the heat bulb in her cage the next morning. She still doesn't quite trust the giant lamp clamp with a polished finish but she will over time.Highly recommended, economical considering how long the bulb will last and how much juice it uses. I will be buying a backup bulb before next winter so if this one ever fries or goes out before it should I will still be able to heat my bird comfortably.EDIT - Another tip I forgot to mention. I plugged the bulb/lamp into a surge protector/power strip. We live on a mountain and get all sorts of power surges and disruptions up here. I found this may affect the life of the compact florescent light bulbs that are supposed to last far longer than normal light bulbs but many times do not if they are frequently on or being used. If a power strip is too large/ugly for the considered space you may buy ones that seat directly on the wall and are not mammoth in size. Just search for",fish aquatic pets,4

"Before I write anything else, I must say the flea zapper does work. It stuns fleas which allows you time to place them in a ziplock bag to dispose of later. However, it makes a very high pitched sound similar to having your ears ring unexpectedly and must be cleaned after each flea is stunned. Cleaning the unit requires each flea be brushed into the ziplock bag which makes using the Flea Zapper a two person job. To top it off, the Flea Zapper does not work well on longer fur. It is most assuredly, not the natural flea treatment for which I had hoped. Save your money and use a flea comb with a disposable cup full of soapy water.",dogs,3

"Like many reviewers, I stumbled upon this product while doing research on how to treat my dog's chronic ear infections. She is a lab mix with floppy ears, and allergies and would CONSTANTLY, and I mean constantly, get ear infections. I was always in and out of the vets office. As soon as her ear would clear up, 1-2 weeks later she would have an ear infection again. You can imagine how expensive it gets, and I felt like my vet didn't believe that I was doing my best to wash her ears every week. I think the main reason she would get ear infections was due to allergies, which would cause her to itch her ears , and then they would get swollen and infected. Anyhow, I was trying to keep costs down and help my poor dog. I used over the counter ear washes like a brand called DermaPet Malacetic Otic, which seemed to help quite a bit but wasn't full proof all the time, and my dog HATED having her ears cleaned with it. Then I tried using a mix of 1/2 White Vinegar or Apple Cidar Vinegar and 1/2 rubbing alcohol. This also seemed to work well (better than the ear wash actually), but again not full proof and my dog hated it. I also found a product called Zymox (with and with out cortisone) that is made with enzymes and is good for clearing up yeast ear infections. This also was a really great product, but if my dog did not have a yeast ear infection then it didn't work at all. Finally, I came across Vet's best. After using the Vets best itching spray (for allergies) and having favorable results, I decided to just try out the ear wash/dry kit, what could it hurt? I liked the fact that it was natural, contained clove to fight infection, chamomile and aloe to soothe her ears, and had no alcohol ! That's right, no alcohol ! I hadn't thought of it before, but alcohol stings. That's when the lightbulb went off, lol. Imagine if someone poured that in MY infected ear. It wouldn't feel so good. So, I thought, well they need alcohol in it to dry the ear out so how does this stuff work. Well, the drying cream turns to a powder when dry, and that's what soaks up the moisture in the ear. So, I bought the product ...and it was time for an ear cleaning...my dog was resistant as usual, but once I put the Vet's Best wash in her ear she stopped resisting. It was like she was in shock, and thinking 'hey this ain't so bad'. Well, the product has been absolutely amazing ! I've been using the wash/dry kit about a year, and my dog has no issues with letting me clean her ears anymore, infact I think she likes it because it soothes her ears. The product works excellent for cleaning her ears and I use both the wash and the dry, and it smells good too. My dog does look a little funny afterwards when it dries b/c she has white powder in her ears, but it comes off and I don't care as long as it works and she is happy. I want to stress that I use this as a preventative to an ear infection ! I wash her ears once a week (more if I think she's having bad allergies) to prevent an ear infection. If I clean her ears and I see signs of an ear infection starting ...maybe a little dirty wax, or faint yeast smell I will wash her ears everyday that week until those symptoms are gone. I would not use this product if my dog already had an ear infection, because her ear canal would probably be swollen, red and irritated. For an actual ear infection I would either use Zymox Otic, or take her to the vet for antibiotics. I'm happy to say, though, that I have NOT had to take my dog to the vet for an ear infection since starting this product, and my dog is happy too ;) p.s. works well on dogs that don't have chronic ear infections too ;) lol I use it on my other dog also.",cats,2
"cool product, the actual material of the tug IS very durable, but the flip side of that is my dog cant get a proper grip on the synthetic material. the 'rope' portion is much less durable, my dog had the elastic out after being left a couple of hours with the toy. still likes it though.i prefer real dog tugs, made from jute. amazon unfortunately doesnt sell any.",dogs,3
"This product works great. Have 2 labs that constantly got away with an inground wire system. Installed this, did the training and raised the correction level and the dogs have not escaped since. Had an issue with the unit and called customer service. I was not on hold for any longer than 2 minutes and spoke to Bill. He quickly took care of me and was courteous throughout the call. Replacement unit is on the way. Great product and company stands behind it. Can't ask for more than that. Thanks Petsafe.",dogs,3

"As cute as this dog house is, our pups wouldn't go inside it. It is deep and dark with a very small opening. It really needs to have a larger opening or windows. The first step broke under my daughter's foot, which I think should've been able to handle the 40 lbs that she is. So the materials are not necessarily the best quality for the money spent. All in all, not good for our dogs.",dogs,3
"The metal bars are not the flimsy type like you see in pet cages, but thick no-nonsense bars with impeccable quality in their golden zinc finish. The xpen has 8 panels that fold in any direction so you can shape the 16 foot long product into a room divider, or snap the ends together with the included golden spring clips to form a rectangle or octagon. I have mine placed in the corner of the room, and so it is more of a bulging triangle at the moment.The product included ground hooks, for persons placing the xpen outside in the yard, as well as thick polymer clips to latch panels that are running straight, so that the pen cannot be tipped over. These come off for easy storage. I originally hung a sheet over the top of the xpen to create an artificial ceiling to employ behavioral shaping to condition my dog into not believing that he might escape by jumping upward, and this has been fully successful, although you can purchase ceilings of bars or a shade tarp separately.I purchased the xpen for my large golden to have a safe place to recover from knee surgery, and so I don't use the built in door, as it has a small 2 inch rise on it and I didn't want him to trip lifting his surgical leg over it, but I instead unfasten the main seam by opening the included spring clips so that I can easily part the panels and afford my pup safe exit.",dogs,3

"Lids close nice, they're easy to get into, and would be perfect except that the description reads ""will hold up to 20 lbs of food"". While this may be true, they don't tell you that you have to stop filling it every so often to shake the container to get the food to settle enough to fit that much food. A minor annoyance, to be sure, but had I known this, I would have bought a larger size.",dogs,3

This is a situation where you get what you pay for. It is very cheaply constructed and is not square so we had to use shims to get it to fit in the door frame squarely. I don't have a lot of confidence in it as my 9 month old uses it to pull herself up. So far it hasn't given out with the shims in there.,dogs,3
I'm not sure that I would go with a smaller version of this but the large works exactly the way they say it will. I have a large and a small dog and both of them sit very nicely while I groom them with the FURminator. It doesn't look like it will work as well as it does but it removes a ton of hair from both dogs. It seems sturdy and so far has been the best investment that I've made in gromming tools yet. I would recommend this to anyone.,cats,2
"It has slick hard plastic feet that do not grip either the floor or the headliner, with very little effort my dog can just push it down.

"I am writing a review only b/c without other people taking the time to write one I wouldn't have bought this item. I have never written a review before. The first time I saw this item I actually passed it up b/c it looked like just a rake. No big deal. hahaha I read the reviews and realized so many people loved it, so I should try it too. I did and I am so pleased. The spokes in the rake are large enough not to get stuck in the grass and weeds but small enough not to let the the poop fall out. Strange review but necessary. haha Hope you buy one too.",dogs,3

"This is my border collie's favorite toy. Despite other reviews, I have found it to be very durable when used as a flying disk to play catch. Other frisbees last about 10 minutes with her -- she bites right through them when she catches them. It flies well despite the weight.I do not think this is a good ""tug toy"" however because of the design. I'm not fond of tugging anyway, and have taught my dog to present me with toys after she retrieves them. She loves frisbee and ball toss most of all, but if you want some thing to play tug, this isn't it.",dogs,3
"My cats love this fountain and are finally drinking enough water. It's very quiet. I can't hear it at all (except for when the water runs low--then it's a little louder). It doesn't splash at all.

"We bought the product after our small breed dog continued to get out, which in turn annoyed the living daylights out of our neighbors and their dogs. We had our yard man install it and lay it out. It worked for a while, until the other yard man cut the wire with the weed eater. After he cut it again, we installed it. If you have another dog who isn't as big of an escape artist as the other dog is, this product can be useless. My other small dog (smaller than my usual ring tailed tooter) was able to chew the wire for the other one and let him escape. The receiver/collar is too large for small dogs. I have never had much success with this product. They should make the wire a bright color so people with low intellect can see the wire and not destroy it. I wasn't too happy with it, my dog's are still escaping.",cats,2

"We got this Nylabone because of the bacon flavor figuring our dogs would love it. They definitely like the bone and chew on it, but no more than their other bones (beef femur). I guess that's pretty good since a plastic bone holds its own against a real bone.One thing to be aware of -- this thing is kinda heavy. Might not be a big deal for your dog, but I have 2 dogs that like to wrestle for toys and also like to chew their bone while laying on the couch. When this thing gets dropped, especially on my hardwood floors, it is loud.",dogs,3

"I purchased this container mainly to store rice and recently we had something of a meal moth infestation. I bought it think that since it's ""Airtight"", it should keep moths out. I was very wrong. A week after using it I started to notice little tiny pieces of the foam gasket sticking to the side of the container. I thought it was just the rubbing that was making it come apart a little bit. Several days later I opened the container and 2 moths flew out. I was shocked, how are there moths inside. I thought maybe I let some in the last time I opened it and didn't notice. The next day I opened the container again to get rice and this time 4 months flew out, now that is odd because I made special care to make sure there was nothing in there before closing. I open the container and look under the cover. I noticed webbed larvae stuck on the top and little tiny flecks of brown in the gasket. I removed the larva then looked closely at the gasket. I noticed one brown spot had something like a brown bug shell sticking out a bit. I decided to remove the gasket to look at it. Throughout the entire gasket, moths had bitten through and laid larva inside the middle of the foam. Ewww... After seeing that I realized this container is completely useless. I was better off not having it because my old container was just fine. The container is ok, but the foam gasket is rubbish. Perhaps something more sturdy and rubber-like or silicone would have been better. Now I have to throw out the entire container of rice.",dogs,3
"My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Labrador Retriever are no pushovers.Even other varieties of highly regarded Canidae food have left them looking up at me over lightly rearranged bowls of food with that 'Why have you turned against us again?' look.But whenever I bring home the thirty-pound bags of Canidae Chicken Meal and Rice, the dogsters nose hungrily around the car before I can even get the stuff out of the trunk. I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs.",cats,2
"The collar worked great for my dog, it seemed to be the right product to use (the shock collars never worked for her).A few downsides..I found it expensive to maintain (the batteries and spray). The collar did go off if there was any loud noises in the environment, or if the other dogs barked...I felt bad!It also stopped working about 6 months after I first bought it. Although that's not a horrible track record, it could be better...I'd hoped to get a little more use out of it :(.",dogs,3

My biggest problem with this thing is that the motor is ridiculously difficult to remove for cleaning. It is a black boxy chunk that is wedged in the bottom, surrounded by plastic that you have to try not to break while prying out the motor.

"This is a very useful product that helps me to bring the phosphate problem under control, finally. I use it on my 44 gal aquarium for a month now and it is still taking out all of the phosphate. However, it should be noticed that it will require some experience and skill level on getting this unit prepqred, particularly the initial backwash portion. I used a T connector to hook it up to a Maxijet 1200 pump and use a reducer on the outlet end of the T to create some back-pressure. This way I can use the same pump to provide both circulation (in the aqaurium) and enough flow to go through this Phosphate Reactor. I set this up in a sink and backwash the reactor with tap water (no PO4 in the tap here in Seattle) and ran it for at about 30 minutes to get rid of the fines as much as possible before I transfer it to the aquarium. Getting the right flow rate for an ideal fluidized bed could be tricky, but doable. I would not recommend using salt water from the tank for backwash and flow adjustment, wasting valuable salt.",fish aquatic pets,4

"Our dog had always had soft stool, but when he started having diarrhea every day, we took him to the vet. (After trying just about every other remedy we could think of - pumpkin, switched his food, gave him probiotics, etc. etc.) They checked his stool and said he had a high bacteria count. At the time I had asked if perhaps he wasn't producing enough enzymes, to which the vet responded ""Maybe."" They proceeded to put him on antibiotics and an artificial stool hardener for about 6 weeks, which only helped superficially. Once he was off the stool hardener, he was back to having diarrhea. I went with my initial idea (I had done a TON of research prior) that the cause was an inadequate production of enzymes (which, as it turns out, can lead to an increase in bad bacteria in the intestines - go figure). With my fingers crossed, I ordered a bottle of Animal Essentials Plant Enzymes and Probiotics. Within a few days of administering the enzymes with each meal, my dog was no longer having diarrhea. Within about another week, his stool was actually firm, which it had never been. I'm happy to say that well over a month later, we have not had a single bout of diarrhea and his stool is firm and normal! Since starting the enzymes, his energy has increased (he's actually digesting his food!) and his coat has improved (again - all those tasty essential fatty acids are actually being used!). We are so thankful this product exists and can't recommend it enough!",cats,2

I knew testing and the prescription product are expensive. I decided to try this first. It has been a miracle product for this dog. He eats it well. His stools are solid and firm. He is now eating all of his food. His coat is looking much better. I highly recommend this product.",dogs,3
"What an amazing product. I used it on my 6 month old Cocker Spaniel for the first time two months ago and I couldn't be happier. It took a few minutes for her to get used to the strap on her snout, but after pawing it and rubbing her face along the floor I was able to connect a leash (not included) and start walking. The video and the print instructions included with the Gentle Lead are very helpful and easy to understand. Now, my pup walks at my side, heels and is generally more behaved when we're in public. I figure I'll start transitioning back to a traditional collar and leash soon.The Gentle Lead is well made and hasn't faded yet (I got the red one), but it has started to fray,thus the reason for four stars. I doubt it'll break under the strain of my 12lb puppy's pull, but I don't feel after eight weeks of prescribed use it should be coming apart already. Not sure if there's a warranty -I generally don't pay attention to that kind of stuff, but I'd definitely lay out the money for another Gentle Lead if this one frays through before my pup is ready to behave in a collar.",dogs,3

"Although I've been buying Nylabones for my dogs for many years, I only recently realized that Amazon carried them for a better price than Petco or PetSmart so I now order all our Nylabones strictly from here. Nylabones help curb destructive chewing, ease boredom, and clean teeth.Like ANY toy, Nylabones carry a risk if not used properly. There is no such thing a completely, 100% safe toy.With that said, I've never had a problem with Nylabones, nor do I know anyone who has. It's ALL about being responsible and knowing your dog. (When it all comes down to it, they can be quite child like. They need YOU to use YOUR head.)Make sure you're buying the appropriate size for your dog. (Don't buy one that's too small, simply because it's cheaper.) If you're using a bone that's too small it will greatly increase the chance of your dog biting off pieces that can be harmful.If your dog is an aggressive chewer, then don't leave them alone for extended periods with any toy. Nylabones included.Be safe and smart!! Your dogs depend on you!",dogs,3
"I searched quite some time for a way to keep a couple of feral cats (that adopted us) warm during the winter when I came across these heating pads. After trapping them to get them spayed and neutered, we set about making comfortable beds for them on our covered porch. Concerned about the cold, I tried these pads. The company was very friendly and helpful. The pads arrived much faster than expected and look to be of great quality. There is a nice washable cover included and the cords are wrapped in metal so the cat can't nibble on it & be harmed. The moment they found out the pads were in their beds they rarely leave them. I can actually even pet one of them now! If I were to speak for the cats, I'd say these are a real hit. I plugged both of them into a power strip with a switch so I can just hit it with my foot to turn them off during the day when the cats are out making their rounds.",cats,2

"We have an adult male fancy rat and even the small size harness was useless. Rats and mice have an amazing ability to wiggle through the thinnest openings, and it is impossible to get either end of this harness small enough to fit. Our rat was able to wiggle forward or backward with ease to escape. And keep in mind that the box insert warns you to keep a finger space between your pet and the harness. Heck, the rat's neck alone is a finger width. The whole time I was struggling to get him in the harness, I was constantly worried I would hurt his neck or legs. It's really stressful on the little guys (not to mention the owner), and is not worth the reward of having him on a leash, so I'm returning the harness tomorrow.While this may very well work with larger animals, I have to give a 1 star review because the picture on the box promises a rat in the harness. What you don't realize is that they used an ultra-high-speed camera to capture that shot, as the rat was out of the harness a fraction of a second later.",bunny rabbit central,1

"We have two adult labrador retrievers who absolutely enjoy toys like this one. The feet are generally the first to come off, but that's only because the dogs chew at them. I suppose they are a distraction to the dogs overall pleasure of having this toy. If your dog is a chewer, this may not be the best choice. This toy does have a squeaker in it, so it is important to give it to your dog under supervision. If you leave it with your dog, I can guarantee the dog will work the squeaker out by chewing enough on the toy to rip it open. Nevertheless, a great toy for a dog who simply loves toys like these. Jakks Pacific sells these are rock bottom prices. You can't buy these AKC toys for as low as this seller does.",dogs,3

This had its pros and cons but overall it is a great item. My cats drank more often and quickly warmed up to drinking from it. They stopped begging for water from out of the sink once they got this.

"This is nice if you have a small dog. I has helped with the barking. But, if you have a smart dog (like myself), as soon as you take the collar off, he starts to bark again. Another thing about it is the fact that it kicks in when it wants to. Also, if you have a smart dog, they would know how loud they can bark before the collar goes off. It works fine at calming down the barking, but does not stop it completely. It does start to work after a few days like it said it would. I would get something that is automatic and has a remote.",dogs,3
"We have had this fountain for about 8 months now. The flowing water is great, and it is very quiet unless it starts to run low. There are a couple glaring problems though. First, the capacity is hardly enough. We have 2 cats and have to refill it once a day. Second, it is very inconvenient to clean it. It isn't diswasher safe, disassembly is a pain, and there are a lot of nooks and crannies where you just can't reach unless you have some kind of narrow brush. This is very unfortunate since have to clean ours at least twice a month. Algae builds up for some reason and I have to take the whole thing apart and do a thorough cleaning, only to have it come back a week or two later.Between the low capacity and the difficult cleaning, I am starting to wonder if it's easier just to use regular bowls.",cats,2
"We adopted a Jack Russell in July of 2008. He was supposed to live for only 3 months because he has lymphoma. The vet had him on high dose prednisone. We were able to decrease the prednisone dose by 75% and more than a year later he was still alive and well (but not cured, he still has those big lymph nodes). He started losing his hair after a year. Turned out to be mange - he was on steroids for so long that it wiped out his immune system (which allowed the mites that live at the hair follicle to take over and rob the hair follicle of nutrition). So he came off the prednisone, then started limping (we're still doing other treatments for the mange). The vet started him on this Aller G-3. The dog won't be fooled in to eating a big pill, so we cut it open and squeeze it on some food - he loves it.After 2 weeks he stopped limping. This week he's back to taking 1-mile walks with me!! Do NOT just choose any fish oil. Much of what is on the shelf will be called ""balanced"", meaning that it contains Omega 6s and Omega 9s, and we already have an over-abundance of those compounds in our modern diets.If you want to know more about the Omega 3's, you can check out the book",dogs,3
"I used this one, in the gallon, titled Just for Cats. It worked to my relief. I saturated the areas completely and ended up using the entire gallon. One area cleared the smell (I had no stains) completely. The other is a much bigger and wider spot so I am going to use it again. I used another product that only made it worse. This product took care of the smell 100%. I cannot vouch for the stain because I didn't have any stains to get rid of. I also didn't wipe it up or pat a towel down. I poured and then placed a small fan all day. The next morning, the smell was gone. Three stars only because it took 1/2 of the spots I treated.",cats,2
"Bought this leash out of desperation, couldn't find the Flexi brand that I had for my other dog. Before one month was up, it stopped retracting unless I slapped it a few times. The spring was weak and pretty ineffective from the beginning. Very expensive and if extended to the limit, it is nearly impossible to retract. Has resulted in my dog coming close to getting into bad situations since I can't control the dog properly once the leash is extended if I need to reel her in quickly. Very angry and disgusted with this product. Utter garbage, and I will never buy anything from this company again. Would rate this zero stars if I could.",cats,2

"This collar has made a huge difference! We have a skittish Great Dane and she pulled at the leash all of the time. Walking a dog that weighs more than me was a bit of a challenge, this halter turned our walks into something we both enjoy. She was bothered by having something on her face initially but after just a few walks she pushes her head into the loops eagerly.",dogs,3

I've used littermaid for the last 4 years and it kept getting stuck but this litterbox that hasn't happen. This the perfect litterbox simply to use but as for quite not true. the only down to this box is it never stops.24hrs a day!! the bowl turns 1 an hour not loud but its like having a noisy fan. I fixed that by putting it on a timer so it comes on 3 times a day for and hour and a half now its perfect!no more backups...,cats,2

After having cats all my life and not wanting to spend a lot of money on littler boxes I found the Omega Paw and I love it. The Omega paw is easy to use and dose not cost an arm and a leg it is by far the best cat box ever for under 35.00 dollars and the best part is there are no replacement mats or anything just use your cat littler and that is it. Thanks Omega Paw.,cats,2

"It's loud enough and the button makes it much easier to use than the clickers I've used in the past. Plus it fits nicely in the palm of my hand, though I did add a wrist strap to make it even more user friendly.Aside from not coming with a wrist strap (and hey, at that price I wouldn't really complain) the only problem is it occasionally gets stuck in the pressed-in position and won't out-click. This problem is solved easily enough by pressing through the opening under the button to de-press the clicker. To do this you need some sort of slender, pointy object like a screwdriver or a knife. After that it works like a charm again.",dogs,3
"This toy is cute. I like it, but my dog doesn't. He doesn't play rough with his toys, so this would be fine for him if he liked it. Because of the voicebox, I wouldn't suggest buying it for any dog that is likely to tear it apart.",dogs,3
"When I received the order of Merial Frontline I noticed the serial # on the box did not match the individual 3 packets inside. I called Merial and they advised not to use the product but to notify the business that I ordered from.

They explained it was probably an error by the manufacturer.",dogs,3

"I have a dog who considers it her personal mission to destroy any dog toy she encounters (Black Lab/German Shepherd). This toy has been ideal for her for two reasons:1) It is shaped like the woodland creature she would most like to catch, yet never can.2) As far as plush toys go, this is the most durable toy I have ever come across. No plush toy will be indestructible due to the inherent nature of being made of stitched fabric. This toy has durable fabric, and the stitching is quite strong.I can also attest to its durability because one evening my husband was looking for something to shoot out of his cannon and chose this dog toy. I can attest to the fact that it came out of the ordeal with no more than a singed tail.Even if your dog is destructive and manages to tear this thing apart (mine has only managed to make it look mangy), I think you will get your money's worth out of it. I will keep buying them as long as they keep selling them.",dogs,3
"After having a car accident and realizing the airbags would NOT be a good thing for my dog I got her this car seat. I was afraid she would hate it but she took to it right away! She normally moves around a lot, wouldn't sit still and always wanted on my lap, but after a few minutes in the seat she was content to watch out the window or just lay down nice a comfy facing the front of the car. I have a large (and fat) chihuahua, almost 15 lbs, she has enough room to lay comfortably while strapped to the belt. This car seat makes for much easier traveling on the both of us.",dogs,3

"Have had cats for over 25 yrs. Adopted two kittens Nov. 2011 & researched litter boxes; finally choosing this one. The product is the best yet. I simply roll it towards the right to collect the clumped ""stuff"" & then tidy up a bit w/ my scooper. Add some fresh litter on top. It's simple to do. Both kittens are using it without any problems. No odors. No hastle. No more liners. Not spending a fortune on litter either. I highly recommend it. Giving it FIVE STARS!",cats,2
My cat seems to enjoy her new gift even at 18 years old. It is fairly quiet and the cord is about 3 feet and may limit where you can set it up. The water seems to stay pretty fresh and never runs dry. I still clean the base once a week as it can become slimy. I am not convinced the filter adds benefit and sediment/food particles settle to the bottom of the dish. I doubt I will purchase more filters. The convenience of not having to tend to the water bowl frequently is wonderful. The reservoir tank drips as it is inserted into the base. A big minus since not user friendly for children. The flow adjuster lever is very flimsy so use a gentle hand. This is still new to my houselhold but am pleased to see a happy cat and hope it holds up over the years.,cats,2
"Easy set up, and worked perfectly the first time I tried it. As far as people giving it one star because plastic latches broke after a year... get a clue. I am thinking it was worth the $3 a month not to have to scoop all the time.",cats,2
"Though I agree with the other reviewers that battery life is short on this collar, it is nonetheless an extraordinary system! We have 2 beagles who are escape artists and rather stubborn and this system works fantastic for them! Training was a breeze - both dogs figured it out quickly, even when we extended their area after 4 months of use. It's been now about 7 months that we have the system and couldn't be happier! We can rest assured that our pets are safe when we are away at work during the day.For the batteries - I read about this trick. Reuse the battery casing and just remove the little battery that is inside. I get replacements online for 4 batteries including shipping for about $8. That is a sweet deal! Look for ""3V Lithium Battery 2L76 CR1/3 N 1/3N"" batteries - you can find them as cheap as $1.50 a piece. I simply removed the little plastic ringlet on the bottom of the casing that kept the battery in place, removed the battery, inserted the new one, and voila! Works like magic and is even easier to fit into the collar without the extra piece.Don't let the other reviews about the batteries discourage you from using this great system. I highly recommend it.",dogs,3
"You have to be careful with this harness. I do love it. The quality is good, the colors are nice, it is easy to wash, and very safe. I like it better than regular harnesses which tend to cut puppies with their tough rope-like straps. HOWEVER, it runs large. I bought a small, and it fit my 25 pound dog. If you are looking to dress up a small breed like a Chihuahua, an XXS is best. For a breed about the size of a Schnauzer, an XS is good. Larger breeds, go with the highest size, which is a Small. The Teacup size is good for puppies around 2-3 months old.",dogs,3
"This stuff is amazing. I was wary and waiting for it not to work, but it did! My Bichon had severe staining around her eyes and it cleared up in only 3 weeks.

"We bought this for our cats, hoping to provide a constant flow of clean water. It's better than having a bowl, with standing water. The first 3 months of owning it, it worked great! Our cats loved playing in the stream of water, and it made us feel better to give them clean, filtered water. How wrong we were! Due to constant water being inside the bowl, mold starts forming inbetween the creases of plastic. We cleaned and changed the water regularly, but there was no avoiding the mold. Soon after, we noticed that the water was barely trickling out of the top. We had to take the entire thing apart & clean out the pump due it being clogged with fur. It worked well after that, but the mold kept forming and it was in places where you couldn't clean well. I used a toothbrush and hot hot water to no avail. This thing has been more trouble than it's worth. Now we're back to a small water bowl, looking for a decent replacement.",cats,2
"I ordered two of this product for our two outside cats that stay in our garage. I had ordered another product that did not work - too low of a wattage. This product works well - the cats love it. Delivery was quick. Only one negative is that it is a hard surface, but it does come with a cotton pad to cover it. It has been very cold recently and I was not worried about the cats since they both took to sitting on this pet bed warmer immediately and I do not worry that it will be too hot. Good product and good buy.",dogs,3
"I have a very active and sweet Border Collie mix who loves chasing and chewing. I try hard to match his energy level, and for the most part succeed, but there are times when I just can't. This Nylabone is perfect for keeping him busy during those times when I can't be playing fetch or chasing him around the house or yard. My only slight concern is whether a hard chewer can crack or break their teeth, or damage their gums during excessively hard and long chewing sessions. Excellent product.",dogs,3
I have a 70 lb lab/pit/x and he loves to chew on these. He knows only to chew on his toys. This one isn't quite his favorite but it will last a long time. It is heavy though so be careful not to let your dog drop it on your foot. It hurts if he does. I would recommend the regular souper bones before purchasing this one.,dogs,3
My dog sheds a lot. She is a short hair dog but hair was flying off her. i used everything and brushed her often. But until I bought this nothng worked. I use this 3 or 4 times weekly and you would not believe the hair it removess. I am extremely pleased.,cats,2

"My African Grey parrot loves swings and this one tops the others we have tried. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 starts is that the first swing only lasted about 2 weeks before she chewed through the rope.

She uses the swing constantly and even says&#34;weeeee&#34; when she is on it, which is so cute.",birds,0

"I got the product yesterday. The bag looked like it was opened and glued back together. I was very hesitant to open it but my dog is running out of food... It is just insane to believe that the original EVO packaging is so bad. It wasn't air-sealed and the top fold looks messy. Again, it looks like some one roll it and glue it together. (like how we would seal it at home!!) This is the first time I got such a bad quality dog food product. VERY disappointed. And I do demand an explanation if the seller cares about their business!! I will not recommend this to anyone.",dogs,3
"When I first took it out of the box I was ready to agree with the one reviewer who said it was a cheap, plastic bowl. But when I saw it was made in America I decided to give it a chance. Once I got it filled and decorated with gravel and a couple plants it looks great! It's nice and clear and looks like glass. My betta really enjoys having the extra room to swim around in. I had him in a 1 1/2 gallon tank before and he wasn't half as active as he is since I put him in this bowl. Plus, since it's plastic it is nice and light and easy to move, so cleaning won't be a chore.",fish aquatic pets,4

I mainly get the chicken and PB flavors. the salmon one seems to have too strong a scent to it that I don't care for.

I figured the batteries weren't charged so I check them with my volt meter and they showed the correct voltage, so I don't know what the problem wasI turned around and bought a second identical collar and it didn't work as well.",dogs,3

"My beloved Betty started peeing on my bed, on electronic equipment, on rugs...everywhere! It was horrible, as you can imagine. I used this product and it completely took the smell out, which is essential if you don't want your cat to think it's okay to pee in these inappropriate places. I also found it removes stains of ALL kinds. I love this product. P.S., if your cat is peeing where it shouldn't, try taking the lid off of the litter box - the smell inside the box repels cats and that's why they (or at least Betty) choose to pee elsewhere.",cats,2
"I bought this product for my 1.5 year old cat, hoping it would be a welcome addition to his toy box. My cat is more than enamored with the bubbles. Not vocal by nature, he begins to meow quite loudly when he sees the container of bubbles. He loves to chase after the bubbles and bite them when they hit the ground. As other reviewers have stated, these bubbles last quite long - much longer than soap bubbles. This allows a single blow of the bubble wand to be enjoyed for many minutes. The popped bubbles do leave a bit of debris behind, but I have found it isn't really that sticky, so I can simply pick it up off of the carpet. They do sometimes get stuck in my cat's fur, but he likes to lick the residue out, so no problem there! I highly recommend giving this item a try! My cat definitely thanks me for the purchase.",dogs,3
"I recently purchased the 42x28x30 crate for my 4 month old German Shepherd. He was quickly growing out of his smaller crate as he is already over forty pounds. I was unsure before ordering whether this would be a sufficiently sized crate for my dog when he is mature. I will tell you we joking call this his condo because it is huge. I am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. and me and my dog could fit in this crate (we actually did lol!). Plus the free divider makes it great as a training crate. If you are considering a crate for a large breed dog like a German Shepherd, this is a great crate for your dog. It is also very sturdy and easy to set up. I am so happy that I saved money and got a great crate!",dogs,3
I love these containers. I would have given 5 stars except the only problem is they don't hold up well. The bottom cracked and we treat it very carefully after reading the other reviews.

My four cats love the Bergan Turbo Scratcher. All of the cats play with it every day. The replacement pads are a great value. When the cats are done with one side flip it over to the other side for continued use. With four cats using the scratcher everyday the pads usually last for about 1 month if I use both sides. So the 2 pad replacement pack lasts a couple of months.,cats,2

"Our lab/Australian shepherd mix is a very tough chewer. I thought, being made of fire hose, this toy would last awhile. She had a corner chewed off and the squeaker out in less than a half hour. Don't waste your money if you think this will hold up to a tough chewer!",dogs,3
"This collar was purchased for a 30lb Aussie who barks incessantly at squirrels and bicyclists and neighbors. It worked almost immediately. He now only barks once and then shuts up. He doesn't seem traumatized by this collar the way he does with his wireless fence collar which made him whine. :-( I would have given it another star except that we went through the first battery in ONE DAY. The batteries we bought with the collar (suggested by Amazon) do not fit the collar. This collar takes PX28A batteries which look like a stubby little AA battery. Also, I would have preferred a quick release collar, but it has a buckle which is a hassle every time he needs to go outside. I do not want to leave the collar on the dog all the time. I will probably try and replace the buckle with a quick release.",dogs,3

"We took two young dogs (less than one year old) to the vet yesterday with 104 plus fevers and extreme listlessness. The culprit turned out to be these tick collars.

Luckily treatment with Yohimbe turned the dogs around.",dogs,3
"These filters are complete junk. They are a multi-layered filter, with each layer of filtration ""supposedly"" providing a beneficial purpose. However, this filter frequently becomes clogged. The first layer of filtration is a particulate screen; good in concept - bad in implementation. The useable surface area of this screen is less than an inch in diameter, so any debris (usually food particles and hair) that falls into the reservoir bowl will clog this filter fairly quickly. It usually takes about a week to clog it up. Once it becomes clogged, the water no longer flows. Well, so much for filtered water.An easy way to unclog the filter is to back-flush it. Weekly back-flushing will extend the filter life for about a month before it has to be replaced.The filters originally came four to a pack, then three to a pack, now only two to a pack, but the price has never decreased. Ok, blame it on inflation. (Greed?)",cats,2

"I bought similar bowls at Petco, and am now going to return them. While the Petco ones have rubber all across the bottom (this one is a 3/4 inch ring around the edge), the Petco ones are slightly lighter weight, and more expensive.These are a good weight, and don't have that annoying fingernail-on-chalkboard sound that some lighter weight metal bowls make. The rubber ring is rubbery, not plastic-y, so it does actually grip the floor.I am using this size (1.2 Pint) for food for my puppy. It may end up being too small/ having too much slop-over when she is full grown, but for now it's a good size for her, and probably will be for at least the next 6 months.I think the ""it stinks"" reviewer got a bad bowl; mine have absolutely no odor...",dogs,3

"I'm not entirely pleased with the Littermaid self cleaning cat pan. I think I've wasted $150 and wish I would never have bought it.I have had the Littermaid LM900 for 3 months now and have two cats. These cats are standard sized 10 lb adults - 1 male & 1 female)so nothing unusual here.Well, the pan doesn't seem to be long enough for either cat. Both of them pee into the rake or a corner near the motor. Ten minutes later when the rake comes along the litter gets all gummed up in it. If they poop then the rake still gets all dirty but the litter gets pushed around and a huge pile of litter gets dumped into the waste receptacle.I think I'm manually scooping as much as I always did, except that I'm a couple bucks poorer.I always keep the litter ""almost"" filled to the proper level since the rake sometimes has a hard time of coming across the properly filled pan and then backs up repeatedly.Well the last time this happened I was on vacation and my neighbor was taking care of the cats.She said it apparently jammed then went back & forth so many times the cats couldn't use the pan one day so they did their duty on the floor next to it. She had to reset it on/off.The rest of the two weeks we were gone it malfunctioned repeatedly and the side grooves that the rake rolls along were both junked up with goopy cat pee/litter and jammed frozen solid.She had to turn the unit off and scoop manually until we got home.I tried resetting the unit and it refued to budge.I took the whole thing apart and cleaned it in the sink then dried and reassembled it.It still refused to work. Only the red light would come on but the rake would not come out.The PetSmart I bought it from refused to refund my money since I didn't have the original box (gee, maybe they intended to try & resell it?).I contacted the manufacturer and they gave me a resetting sequence to perform. Still no luck. So they authorized me a replacement pan since it looks like the motor burned out. They had me mail (at my own expense) half the parts on the pan to prove I owned one AND $10 to cover shipping the new one out to me.It's been 3 weeks I've been waiting for the replacement pan and have had to go back to the manual $4 cat pan. They cashed the check so I know they got my ""proof package"".I would have preferred to get my $150 back but they refused me that. So it cost me $10 more to buy my replacement pan.I wish I never would have bought this pan. It still requires manual scooping and daily maintenance.",cats,2
It greatly reduced the shedding of our lab. First time we used the Furminator we collected a whole grocery sack full of hair. Highly recommend this product!,cats,2

"At first I was dissatisfied that the colors weren't as bright as they appeared in the ad, but then I put it in my aquarium with plants and other decor and it looks great! It looks like a mini coral reef and the colors blend well with the plants on a light white gravel. My fish also use the cave to hide or explore and that is always fun to watch. The quality seems good also. So all-in-all I am very happy with it and the price was very good for the quality.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Our kitty loves food. She learned within a day where the food was kept and to associate those strange big people with food almost instantly. Consequently, no matter how much we fed her, she constantly whined and screamed for food. She would make a bee line to the pantry door every time she heard it open or would lie in front of the door trying to stretch her legs as far underneath as she could to reach the food bag. We had to find a way to disassociate ourselves from feeding and do it before kitty drove us crazy.After much research, I concluded there is no perfect or inexpensive solution. I decided to try the Ergo Small Auto Pet Feeder.Positives:* This is one of the only feeders that allows you to program multiple feedings over multiple days and has a large enough canister that doesn't need to be constantly refilled.* Contrary to many of the complaints I have read regarding programming the timer, I found it as simple to program as an alarm clock. Really, I don't understand what the fuss about the ""poor"" instructions is about ... there are apparently lot of people who don't know how to program alarm clocks ... or, follow directions.* It works as advertised. I had the feeder programmed to feed her 1.5 ounces, 4 times each day, 7 days a week and functioning properly within thirty minutes of opening the box.* Within a few days, our kitty learned to listen for the patter of food hitting the tray, lost most of her interest in the closet as soon as we removed the food bag, and, mercifully, stopped begging us for food.Negatives:* It is NOT cat ""smarts"" proof. If your cat is remotely intelligent or moderately curious he/she WILL figure out how to shake or tap or paw more food from the auger tube. Our cat figured this out after ONE feeding. This design flaw could have been easily remedied by the manufacturer. Nevertheless, it is not the ""all-your-cat-can-eat"" exaggeration some reviewers have described. Unless your cat is a behemoth and pounds the heck out of the machine, he/she will only be able to paw out a few kernels at a time from the last twist of the auger. Which is a small price to pay for having a smart cat.Our gambit worked. She is learning to disassociate us from feeding more and more every day. Best of all, she stopped whining and screaming for food. Worth every penny.Personally, I am quite pleased with the Ergo Feeder and due to my own need to ""fix"" things that can be improved, I plan to build a box to house the feeder in that will solve the ""buffet"" issue.",cats,2
"I was initially excited about this toy. Our dog loves all things rope and fabric, and I expected it to be fairly durable. He managed to rip the toy to pieces in a matter of minutes, and there was a lot of batting that he could have ingested if I hadn't been watching him closely.",dogs,3
"I have 3 shorthaired cats and the Zoom Groom is my front line of defense against shedding. When used properly in small circular motions, the Zoom Groom is super effective at removing loose fur - I am always surprised at the size of the fuzzballs it gets off my cats, even when they don't seem to be shedding much.The reason I really love the Zoom Groom, though, is because my cats love it. I've never owned a grooming tool that makes them visibly excited when I get it out. Even my spazzy shy cat who doesn't like being touched, much less brushed, sprawls out on the floor and purrs when I Zoom Groom her. It's kind of miraculous.Like a curry comb, I don't think the Zoom Groom is intended to be a standalone tool so don't be surprised if it doesn't leave your cat looking polished. Most of the fur does stick on the brush but there are inevitably some stray hairs that end up on the surface of the coat, and these can easily be wiped off with your hand or a damp paper towel. I also typically use a regular brush to smooth the fur back into place after Zoom Grooming, since the circular motion can make their coat a little wonky.All in all this is an awesome grooming tool (especially for the price!) and I highly recommend it.",cats,2
"My lab has suffered from chronic ear infections for the last 2 years. We've gone through it all, from weekly vet visits, to yeast treatments, injected steriods and califlowered ear canals. I felt so bad for him! Not only was there a constant stink (either from an infection or the latest medication) but one ear had been so badly damaged, he could no longer raise it and it was always lopsided, hangly limply against the side of his head.Today I'm writing this and he's looking at me with both ears perked! The smell is gone, the gunk has cleared out and his ear cleanings are now a breeze. Thank you to this amazing product! Not only did it clear up the problem in a few weeks, its smell 100x better than everything else we used. I got my dog back.",cats,2

"The puppy play pen is a great item. The size is perfect( I have an energetic 3 lb puppy).The pen is very easy to move from place to place which comes in very handy when my husband and I are doing front yard lawn work. We take the pen outside with us,it has an open bottom, and put Dudley in the pen with a few toys and some water and he is a happy puppy. The puppy pen is also very reasonably priced. My sister bought one for her puppy.",dogs,3
"My problem was that we had a sweet cat who unfortunately didn't lower her fuzzy butt to pee...it went right over the side of the box...terrible problem. Somone suggested a covered litter box...I picked this one as the price was right and the other reviewers liked it. SO do I. I am using the bags included since my cat will pee on the side of the box otherwise, but now it flows back into the litter where it belongs. And it is very, very big...the kitty liked it immediately. And free shipping? Thanks Amazon!",cats,2
"Our 13-year old Lab/Whippet mix likes to lie outside on our porch bench all day, watching the world go by. Often, however, it's just too cold for her even with her coat on. This heating pad is exactly what we needed to keep her warm on cool mornings. I use an outdoor extension cord to plug the pad into an outdoor outlet, and then put the pad on the bench. Blackie can now lie outside without shivering and she is obviously very comfortable on her warm pad.I bought the Large size pad and it is plenty big for the dog to stretch out, about the same surface area as one of our large couch cushions. The heating pad comes with a washable lightweight fake sherpa cover that wraps over the ends of the pad. I leave this cover on but also lay an old towel on top for a bit more cushiness and easy cleaning. There's a valve to adjust the amount of air in the pad; this layer of air provides both insulation and cushioning. I want the pad to be slightly bendable to fit my space, so I press out some of the air before sealing the valve. The pad doesn't always feel very warm when I put my hand on it, but if I sit on it for a minute or two I can definitely feel the warmth. It seems to be just the right temperature to keep my short-haired dog warm without creating uncomfortable hot spots. Finally, our pad doesn't make any ""crinkly"" noises when the dog moves around on it, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. The only slight negative is that the bottom of the pad is a bit slippery and it sometimes slides off the upholstered bench when Blackie jumps down. I think I can fix this by putting some non-slip shelf liner underneath it. Overall, this product has made a great difference in our elderly dog's quality of life and I'm very happy to have found it on Amazon.",dogs,3
"I bought two of these beds over 18 months ago. At that point, we had two ""medium"" dogs that weighed about 30 and 35 lbs. The beds were perfect for them. Six months ago, we got a German Shepherd puppy, who has grown to about 70lbs. He loves to jump onto the bed. I had to start tightening the bolts every few days, which I have found out is not only due to them loosening, but also because the bolts are actually ""stretching"". One stretched to about 1/2 the thickness that it was originally (right above the threads) and just broke on the last tightening. I know the bed shouldn't have to survive a 70lb GSD ""puppy"" jumping on it, but I'm disappointed that the bolts are not made of ""hardened"" material. They should not stretch. Luckily, I have two beds and will use one for parts and hopefully get a few more months out of it.This bed would be so much better if the manufacturer had two parallel rails on each of the three sides instead of just one. This would minimize the stress at the bolts. That actually just gave me the idea to try to build one ""frankenbed"" out of the two beds I have.",dogs,3
"I finaly broke down and bought this replacement door fitted great took mins to install.We should of done this years ago, Our old one had been letting cold air inand I hated it.Once we replaced it with the new flap house much warmer.

"These mice are great! Our two cats love them. Other mice are more fragile and our cats have broken them in two and eaten the insides--not good! These mice are more solid, don't have an individual label you need to remove, and rattle so the kitties enjoy them more. The seller is great too--Amazon shipped the wrong mice and the seller offered to replaced them. Great to do business with. Will order again, once our cats are done with these!",cats,2

"We've had a fair share of toys for our puppy, and beyond all others, this toy lasted the longest. I was surprised to see the number of negative reviews in this regard. I will complain about the squeaker, however, which broke on the first day (though it took several months for our dog to extract it, as is his wont). We were very happy with its endurance while he was a puppy -- we'll order it again and see how he does now that he's over a year old.",dogs,3
These work well for clipping our 50 pound beagle-mix's nails. We try to do it after a bath so the nails are a little softer.I would have given it a 5-star rating but the little latch that locks the clippers closed is a little loose and sometimes locks them while trying to use the clippers. Just a little annoying but not a show-stopper.Good quality otherwise and work well.,dogs,3
What can I say other than it works just as I expected it would. I do like that it doesn't drip when not in use.,cats,2
"I bought this unit based on reviews, and the unit itself is stable, however I wish the low flow was a slower stream, and when you put theresevoir on it does leak, no way to tip fast enough. I was also under the impression that the unit filled from the resevoir however I have had to fill at the bowl to keep the unit to the right level. My cats are using it, however they still prefer the toilets. (I adopted abandoned kittens that were left in a house for a long, long time). Maybe with time, cleaning took 40 minutes should be quicker once I get use to it. All in all a good unit.Heather",cats,2
"The Feeder is a nice design but the advertizing is incorrect and misleading. The two bowls together are not even the size of a medium size bowl. The bowls should be LARGE enough for a LARGE/MEDIUM dog... Not the manner in which it is advertized as ""two bowls 2 qts."" Very dishonest. Each bowl is therefore barely a quart !!!",dogs,3
"I got a little worried after I purchased this collar and read all the negative reviews on here, but I gave it a shot and it's actually been a god send. My dog is also a maltese (the guy at Petco said this type works well with small dogs) and he was barking for hours while I was at work. After my first condo complaint I got the citronella collar and he was completely traumatized by it. He was hiding under the bed for hours, wouldn't play with anyone. So I took that collar back. Then another neighbor complained so I thought I would try this sonic collar. Every time he hears it, he immediately stops barking and even whining. I only heard it go off once when he didn't actually bark, which some people had remarked on. I also made a point to disconnect the battery when he wasn't wearing so the battery wouldn't run out, since I saw other people had issues with it. All and all this collar has been very helpful!!",dogs,3
"I used Frontline Plus on my Aussie one time and it killed hiim. The product was purchased from our vet and was supposed to be the best there is. Fronline Plus is a good product if you dog can tolerate the active ingredient, Fipronil, which is a neurotoxin specific to invertebrates (including fleas and ticks); it over stimulates the flea or tick's nervous system causing convulsions and death within a few hours for fleas and within 48 hours for ticks. HOWEVER, some dogs are unable to tolerate Fipronil and they can go into convulsions, it can cause blindness, seizures, calcinosis cutis and a myriad of other problems including kidney failure, liver failure and diabetes.The problem with Frontline Plus, besides the ones I have already mentioned, is the manufacturer turns a deaf ear to anyone who reports problems. And the manufacturer refuses to put any type of warning on the packaging. And, when you go to your vet they say things like ""this couldn't be from Frontline Plus, it's completely safe"", and ""maybe you should find yourself another vet if you think this is from Frontline Plus"".The manufacturer of Frontline Plus states that they want to 'help' our pets and our vets are supposed to be trained professionals who want to 'save' or 'care for' our pets. Maybe these vets are just in the business to 'make money' off of pet owners and possibly it's the same with the manufacturer of Frontline Plus.Some vets will say that if you didn't purchase Frontline Plus from them you received a fraudulent or counterfeit product. Since when did Sam's Club, Costco or Pet Meds start making counterfeit Frontline Plus? And if you go to one of these stores telling them this what do you think their lawyers would do with that information?If I could give the product a minus 10 stars I would do so. But in this case it's not the product that deserves the minus 10 it the manufacturer and the manufacturer of Frontline Plus should be held accountable. They need to be responsible enough to warn consumers. This would be the same as cereal manufacturers putting warnings on their labels about their product being in the same area as peanut dust, (you have heard people who are allergic to peanuts can die, right?). So the manufacturer of Frontline Plus needs to be responsible enough to inform vets that there can be problems as well as the public.I have tell everyone I meet about the problems with Frontline Plus and if I see someone in a store looking at Fronline I tell them also. You'd be amazed how people are turned off once they know what damage this stuff can do. I have also told several vets but not sure they wanted to hear what I said.",dogs,3
"This seems to cause just the right amount of mild discomfort for Jonas to be able to understand that I want him to stop, or whatever...It is the only collar that has worked to train him...",dogs,3
"I have had the product for a couple of months and although the concept is wonderful, the actual product is extremely shoddy. The clips won't stay in place and the litter leaks out every time I clean it. The box itself is very heavy when filled with litter. It is difficult for an elderly person, such as myself, to operate this product due the weight. I have solved that problem by placing the box on a table and it is quite managable that way. The actual box is very flimsy. The available space inside the box is very small even though I have the large size. If the manufacturer would improve on this product and make it more sturdy and construct it so that the clips stay in place they would have a really wonderful product. Even with its flaws, I still prefer it over the regular litter box.",cats,2
"I have had this thing for almost a year now and am very annoyed with it. It is very critical that you always have the right amount of weight, and the right weight distribution, for it to reliably cycle after the cats use it. If the weight is too much, the pressure switch will always stay depressed, meaning that it won't cycle. If there isn't enough weight, then then there won't be enough to trigger it at all. The problem is; there is no way to always ensure that there is the right amount of weight being that you can't know how much weight the cats are adding to it at any given time, and you have to guess how much litter to put in, and how much to replace when you empty the bin. And the weight distribution is not the same when the bin is empty versus when it is full, so its effectiveness changes throughout the week. It is a really flawed design. Right now though, the switch absolutely refuses to return to the resting state after it is depressed, no matter how much weight is in it. The only way to cycle it is to turn it on and off and manually cycle it, which I'll admit is better than scooping by hand, but is not worth $400 for this POS.",cats,2
Very quick delivery. I got this for my dogs about 6 yrs ago at a pet store as a last resort for a durable toy that would be enjoyable for them for more than a week. It is their favorite toy!

"The product information says that it takes at least 30 days for this product to work. At 24 days, I was still removing at least 10 fleas from my dog, per day - the same as before I started using Flea Away. I can't believe that 6 more days would have made any difference. And although the many high-dose B vitamins in the tablets are water soluble (i.e., if the dog gets more than she needs, her body will get rid of it without toxicity), the Vitamin E is not water soluble. Vitamin E can increase bleeding risk and I was a bit worried about my little dog receiving too much of this vitamin. I stopped the pills at 24 days with no relief in sight.",dogs,3
"I own three of these little canister filter and they are amazing. Have two running on ten gallon tanks and they do a great job, the spray bare makes the outflow so elegant and lets the tank have no stagnant water on the top. Also have one on a 4 gallon tank and cleans it well. Doesn't over whelm and of the fish even though it may be a little to powerful. cleaning these are very easy and convenient the hoses disconnect and just walk it over to the sink. not water dribbling out and a easy clean. This little filter is great! But don't buy the 511 not powerful at all. Not a good buy",fish aquatic pets,4
"Chemi-pure is a bag of active carbon with ion absorption resins mixed in. It is a chemical filter that provides chemisorption and diffusion of gases, and the ion absorption resins as the name implies absorb dissolved ions in the water through a process known as ion exchange. It doesn't do anything for cloudy water - but it isn't designed to, so I'm not sure what the last guy was expecting. It's like buying hand lotion and saying it doesn't do anything for sweaty armpits. For cloudy water he should have relied on frequent small water changes, or a diatomaceous earth filter.For what Chemi-pure is specified to be used for, it is my favorite chemical filtration for my Malawi's. I typically stick two 10oz bags in the top bucket of my Eheim canister filter and fill the gaps with filter floss. On a rule of thumb, one 10oz bag is good for 40 gallons or less. It lasts about 3 months max.",fish aquatic pets,4

My cat used to eat her food too quickly when I used to put it in her food bowl and she would throw it up a few minutes later. I've had this product for a few years now and my cat eats her food slower and no longer has the problems that she used to. It's also fun and rewarding for your cat like a game! She loves when I put the ball out and she chases it around for hours even after the food is all gone she still wants to play with it. This was probably the best purchase I have ever made for my cat.,cats,2

I'm down to 2 very large cichlids and one of the them terrorizes the other. We put the fish divider into my 55 gallon tank and no more fish fights. The only complaint I have (as it is mentioned by other purchasers) is that you have to move the gravel up against it to help keep it in place. Cichilds love to move rocks & gravel around so I have to keep pushing the rocks up against the bottom of the screen so they don't try to go under it to get to the other fish and start another fish war.,fish aquatic pets,4

"This seems like a quality product if your dog is not a strong chewer. My 80 pound puppy loved it....carried it around, slept with it.

I don't think this would happen with a mild to medium chewer... it initally seemed pretty well put together.",dogs,3
"My Female Rottweiler has been playing with this toy since she was a puppy. This toy lasts for years and she has only been able to rip one apart. No matter how hard she has tried, she has rarely been able to tear one up, whether we throw it like a frisbee, play tug of war or just lying on the floor chewing on it. One draw back for some of you may be the squeaking noise that it makes. My dog loves to make the toy squeak, and it is loud, so if you are thin on patience when it comes to noisy toys, I would tell you to use it at the park or in the back yard. This is by far the best toy that we have ever purchased for our Rottweiler!",dogs,3
"I have two sets of the size M for my 90 pound GSD mix and 88 pound lab mix. I use these for hiking in the Sierra. Both sets of boots have probably seen about 100 miles now and are still in great working condition. The dogs hate them for the first few steps but promptly forget about them as we start moving. There is a learning curve for me each time I put them on regarding how tight I need to strap them to get them to stay, but that usually gets sorted out in the first several hundred feet of hiking. I've tried other boots before, but for my dogs this is the best. The soft fabric upper protects their dew claws and that upper pad. With every other shoe (really only about 2 other brands) that upper pad always got sliced based on how the boots hit it. I would definitely recommend these, but listening to other user reviews I think you need to try these on your dog and check out how the various edges hit your dogs paws and adjust the size or brand accordingly. And no they are not waterproof, but my dogs have worn them running around in ponds and even lakes and they quickly dry.",dogs,3

"Not only is this product great for removing pet stains such as urine; it has many other uses. One of our dogs went into heat unexpectedly and left stains all over the light colored carpeting while I was at work. The stains had sat there for hours and I was sure they would have set in already. I tried Nature's Miracle on the stains and they came out of the carpeting. While still in amazement that those stains disappeared, I tried this product on an old lasagne stain that was on the dining room carpeting; it took the stain out. We also use this product on heavily traveled carpet areas to pretreat the carpet before shampooing; it works great! I have also found wonderful uses for this product as a pretreatment when it comes to laundry stains. It won't remove everything, but organic stains do come out if Nature's Miracle is used before any other type of cleaning agent is used. We definitely keep the gallon sized container on hand for many household uses, in addition to pet stains.",cats,2

The 14 year olds are slowing down but again, while on Vetri disc, they act like youngster. This supplement is a must!!",cats,2
Used it for the first time with my Sheltie. It was great for traveling. He coule see us and that made all the difference in the world.,dogs,3
"Despite what the previous two reviews say, I have found that this product WORKS! I have an 85 pound German Shepherd who loves to chase squirrels, and he is able to easily pull me off my feet when he wants to chase one. ""Leash training"" just did not stick with him. Perhaps I wasn't consistent, but it became a chore to take him for a walk and so I started to not do it. This ended up creating even more difficulties!Contrary to what earlier reviewers say, if you fit the Gentle Leader to your dog correctly it does *not* apply constant pressure and is *not* like being mouthed over the muzzle by another dominant dog. What it does do is allow you to control the dog by its nose, rather than by its throat. This has huge advantages",dogs,3
"My neutered 4 year old tuxedo cat had out of nowhere started peeing on our leather couch in the cracks between the cushions. I chewed him out the first time I saw him do it and cleaned up the pee with white vinegar and water. I keeping an eye on him when he did head for the litter box and I noticed he was having difficulty peeing, actually straining and then only releasing a dime size amount of pee. I took him to the vet to find out he had that dreaded problem that MANY neutered male cats get where they get crystals in their urine and have stones and problems passing urine. That is why he had started peeing on the couch. After a huge vet bill and a change in his diet to food that made specifically for maintaining a healthy urinary tract he improved on going in the litter box. I recommend this product to anyone who has had a problem with their cat suddenly peeing in a place they never had before. It worked for us!",cats,2
Great quality and a low price. Definitely a must have for anyone who owns an aquarium. It's simple to use as long as you follow the directions correctly.,fish aquatic pets,4
This product did not have any impact on my dogs barking at all.My dogs would stand right next to this and back just like they normally do. I often turned the alarm to audible just to verify that it was even working. After three weeks of trying I finally returned the trainer.,dogs,3
"I first got the cat charmer years ago when a friend had recommended it to me as their cats loved the one that they had and I and my cats have LOVED it! It dances around and it easy for the cat to chase and sometimes catch (which for my cat is good because if she can't catch it every once in a while she bores quickly). Both cats that have used the charmer have loved it. It's practically indestructible as well. I have had this charmer for over twelve years and it is still as good as when I first bought it. It gives the cats exercise and stimulates their minds as well as they have to mentally ""chase"" the toy instead of just pushing a toy around on the floor. It is a good interactive toy and anyone of any age can use it to play with their cat. I would recommend it to anyone.",cats,2
The medium size is very large and I could not adjust it to be tight enough for my dog's neck.I have him wear it in addition to the other collar I connect his leash to when we go out at night for walks. I think it will be very helpful as the days are getting shorter. The light is very bright and I don't think cars will have a problem seeing us.,dogs,3
"Buddy is almost 100 pounds, so I got him the large size Squeaker Football, and it is quite a mouthfull for him. But he gets the whole thing in his big mouth, squeaking it like mad and prancing around with the biggest, goofiest grin on his face whenever I let him play with it. The sound of it can be irritating after a while, so I don't leave it out for him all of time. Also, the surface of the football is the same as an ordinary tennis ball, which is something that Buddy will gnaw off in the course of time, so for this reason I do not let him use it as a chew toy. Mostly I try to engage him in playing ""fetch"", which he does enjoy, but it is hard for him to completely relinquish the toy after he brings it back--he has to give it a few happy squeaks for fun first. Annoying noise, but it makes him ecstatic!",dogs,3
"I recently bought this product for my 150 Gallon aquarium, before I used this, I was using a smaller Cleaner, from walmart, and would have a very difficult time getting it to clean my aquarium. The Walmart Magnets where not as powerful and would fall off. But this Product is most excellent. The Magnets are very powerful, so much so that I smashed My Fingers with it once,and bruised them up so buyer beware, keep this product away from children!! As it can cause severe pain if your fingers get caught in the middle of the powerful snapping magnets while they Attract. Its perfect for Large Aquariums I recommend this product to all aquarium keepers!!",fish aquatic pets,4

Our neighbors started complain and they never did for our 2 boxers.

"I recently got myself a husky puppy and I had her on Pedigree puppy food and she didn't like it at all, she just sniffed it and left it alone. I was worried because she had two vet appointments and between those two appointments (one month apart) she only gained 5 pounds.Seeing as how she only gained 5 pounds, I decided to switch her dog food. After looking at all the puppy food at my local grocery store, i bought a bag of this food. As soon as i opened the bag when i got home, she jumped on me to get to the food. She really loves it, and never turns it down. This is great because now i don't need to buy treats to train her, i use the dog food! So far she has learned how to stay, lie down, speak and currently learning how to roll over.At her next appointment (again, a month apart) my puppy doubled in weight! She gained 16 pounds and this food has also improved her coat. It's soft and really shiny. This food also cut back on her constant chewing, I'm guessing the hard kibbles and the soft pieces of meat calmed her itching gums.This food is great, if you're hesitant to buy the food, get a small bag and try it out. This will help your puppy's growth and give them a shiny coat that people envy, I've had numerous people ask me what i feed her and they all can't believe that her coat is so shiny and soft especially since she is blowing out her fluffier and thicker winter coat.Pick this puppy food, your pet will thank you",dogs,3
"Every time I get this leash out, my dogs know they are going for a run and they can't hold in their excitement. The usually mellow nine year old starts by bouncing off the walls, then remembers that he must SIT if he is to be on the leash. The always excitable two year old dog starts running laps around the house - her warm up, I suppose.Lots of ways to connect/disconnect, and I've even used the ""belt"" with a regular leash if I want to run with one dog on each side.",dogs,3
"we had 2 cats who were fighting several times a day and also marked the furniture.Our vet was using a Comfort Zone Feliway diffuser in their exam room and she said that it reallymade a difference in making their feline patients feel more at ease. So we decided to give this a try at home. It took about a day to take effect.Though the 2 kitties didn't stop fighting completely( I have to add that the cats are outdoors as well so they are not constantly exposed to Feliway), it did reduce the fights to maybe one/ week instead of several times a day. When they did fight, it was not as intense as before and the fights didn't last as long. The furniture marking has stopped( we are also using Sofascrams on the furniture and they keep the dogs off the couch as well ",cats,2

"I only give this item 2 stars instead of 1, because it did appear to be made pretty well and was of a higher quality than I was expecting for such a cheap price. First off - I bought this items to use for my dog on backpacking trips, in and attempt to keep our dog (Golden Retriever) from being soaked when getting into the tent at night to sleep. Well, upon opening the package I was hit with the horrible smell that was contained in the clear plastic bag the raincoat was in. This wasn't the first time I've smelled this particular smell, but have noticed it on many petroleum based products I've purchase before. (Google ""rubber smelled like kerosene"" and you will see other products with similar complaints). I knew right off that there was no way I would put it on my dog with such a pungent oder, very similar to kerosene. I washed the item twice with sent away sport wash and it still didn't decrease the strength of the odor. I actually had to hang the raincoat in my garage, because the smell started to permeate throughout the entire house. I have since sent the item off for return and I expect I will not have any problems with the refund. Amazon did make it very easy to return, providing the shipping label so that I could just package it back up and stick it in my mailbox for pickup.My story is just one of the many that happen due to the fact I wasn't able to hold the product in my hand and inspect it before making my decision to purchase. I hope this review gives everyone out there fair warning about purchasing this raincoat. I am actually shocked that there aren't any other reviews describing the ""kerosene"" smell??",dogs,3

"So, I liked this scooper a lot at first. However, after a few uses the wire teeth would get caught on the grass making them bend. Then I'd have to use the fence or something to straighten them. It got to the point where they wouldn't straighten anymore, making it nearly impossible to scoop. Yesterday, it finally snapped after trying to straighten it so much. I had it about a month. I would love a refund, but who thinks I would want to return a USED pooper scooper? Gross. Find something made better.",dogs,3

Within a day or two after treatment, no more worms.",dogs,3
"First, I never, ever write reviews. I always read them before purchasing, but then forget to get on and complain/brag about my purchase. But I had to get on and write a review a couple of weeks after buying this as the negative reviews I read nearly swayed me from purchasing it and that would have been a mistake. Believe me, the last thing I wanted to do was waste money on something that likely wouldn't correct my papillion's incessant barking, but I live in an apartment complex and my papillion barks constantly. I just can't bear to put a bark collar on her, after having tested one and spray bottles, Cesar's ""shh"" and various other corrective behavior all failed me. Quite honestly, even despite the negative reviews on this product, I liked the idea of it and I was desperate for some relief from her random and unrelenting barking, which would often startle me awake or scare the life out of me while sitting at my desk working; seemingly in response to leaves falling in the back yard or some other non-event. I can only imagine what my neighbors endured when I was gone! With all this in mind, I decided to spend the $27, knowing I could return it if it didn't work--and like I said, I was desperate. Two weeks later and to my amazement, it works--almost from day one! Essentially, for my dog, it works to interrupt her enough to stop that pattern of barking that begins when she hears a noise and then just escalates. Instead, she barks, becomes instantly distracted by the ultrasonic noise from the device (I can't hear it) and then looks around as though she has forgotten why she was barking in the first place. No pain, no discomfort or fear from her, just a calmer dog and a happier owner. I'm sold.",dogs,3

"This is my first product review and I had to write one this time because I feel so strongly about this product. I first saw this liter pan on a local TV station being demonstrated and being given a ""thumbs up"" for the product. The next day I ordered it. I am now on my third one since I have 5 cats and it is wonderful! It saves time, no more scoping litter. Just roll it over, thump a little on the bottom to loosen any debris caught on the bottom and dump the tray, what could be easier. Out of the three boxes only one had a minor problem with the clamp and that was resolved by cutting away the excess plastic. Other than that I have no complaints with it at all and my cats adjusted to an enclosed liter pan without any difficulty. I do use clumping liter, Fresh Step, and have no problem with odor or litter being stuck to the box.",cats,2
"Although the playpen is visually attractive and blends in nicely with a white kitchen, there is one big problem! We have found that this particular pen will not contain our little 2 pound yorkiepoo!

We have tried to cover it with different objects and the little bugger is still able to maneuver her way up and out of this particular pen. Too bad, because it is extremely easy to assemble and super easy to travel with, but if you are looking for a pen to contain your pup, I would suggest looking for one with a cover.",dogs,3
"i have somewhat finicky chihuahuas and they absolutely LOVE the hide-a-squirrel! over the course of a few months, the original squirrels got torn up, so i was happy to see that amazon sells replacements. although after shipping, i might as well buy a whole new set. but otherwise, great toy. i don't know what it is, but it's the only stuffed toys my dogs will play with. just be weary that the ""large"" size squirrels aren't very big. they're perfect for my chihuahuas, so if you have a larger dog, i suggest getting the bigger ones.",dogs,3
After reading good reviews about this product I ordered it with confidence (especially considering the price). I was very disappointed with the quality and had to return the crate. First when I opened it and was trying to set it up I cut my finger. I wouldn't want my dog in there getting cut up so I looked and found that many of the intersections in which wires had been welded together were very sharp. I continued to set the product up and discovered that it would not even set up properly. When I tried to put the walls up they did not align properly and therefore the crate was not secure. This product was very cheaply made. I returned it and got a Best Pet brand crate which I love and so does my new puppy!,dogs,3

"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 14 year old cat. I could tell it was a solid, well build product right out of the packaging. It has enough weight to it so it stays in place while your cat scratches. It can be put on the floor, leaned against the wall or mounted directly to the wall with the included hardware.As for what my kitty thought - she absolutely LOVED it! As soon as I got the wrapping paper off she was already scratching it.. (with the added help of a little catnip). She scratched it, pulled herself over top of it, hugged her paws arround it and generally mauled it for most of Christmas day. Since it it sits a few inches off the ground, it has also become her latest perch. She sits on it with this regal look as if it were her throne. She has now been using it for over a week she could not be happier.UPDATE 1/30/2013 - I have now owned this product for over 1 year. The cat still uses it every day. It has worn a bit on one end b/c of the way my cat likes to scratch but it's still in good shape.",cats,2

I accidently shocked myself and it was more of a suprise than pain. We have one disc in the hall area we want to keep them from and the other is extra to use as needed. Currently the second disc under the Christmas tree. This has worked great. The dogs learned quickly and the gates are gone.",dogs,3

"This is a great looking ornament, but takes some time to make it work.1- The treasure chest is too light. It will not stay in place. What makes it even more important is in order for the moving lid to work, the chest should be placed in a horizontal position. And without taking care of the light weight, it would move very easily and the moving lid would get messed up. We weighted the chest down by putting two gravels inside it.2- You should really have an air valve to control the flow of the air to the chest. That way you cal also adjust the frequency in which the lid opens.** Overall",fish aquatic pets,4
"We have a Newfoundland. BIG DOG. Most dog costumes are way to small. But this comes in our dog's size. I was having a big birthday party, and I wanted her to look the part as well. This collar looks great on a black dog. AND it is comfortable to wear. The collar is on an elastic, so it's not going to pull or constrict. I don't think she was even aware it was on her. Since it is comfortably around the neck, there is little reason for a dog to mess with it.The four stars are due to the fact that some of the sequins came off as she romped around, or just walked inside with company around. There are still plenty of sequins on the collar, but there were perhaps 2-3 dozen that came off. You can't tell they are missing, except that we picked them off the floor.It looks good. It comes in all sizes. It's comfortable to wear. Sometimes a few sequins come off.",dogs,3
"I love this harness. I have two dogs to walk and before I purchased this harness I would dread the dog walking. My youngest dog is a puller. She can't wait to get on with the walk and so would pull me like she was a dog pulling a sled, nearly pulling my arm out of its socket. Not to mention the other hazards that could result from this type of behavior. More than once I was literally pulled to the ground and I knew something had to be done. Walking one dog at a time was not an option because the dog left behind would be in quite a state when I returned and I have had to replace the shades on the window because of the dog trying to get out while I was gone with the other dog. When I received this harness I thought, hopefully this one will work. I have tried other harnesses that only seemed to increase the pulling. When we got outside on our first walk with the Easy Walk Harness I realized that a miracle had taken place. No pulling, both of my arms can hang comfortably by my side now and I can walk both dogs at the same time and usually without incident. Of course that is not counting when the dogs see a cat but even then it is much easier to bring them under control. I recommend that you make sure to get the right fit but other than that this is the best product I have found to prevent pulling. I have nothing negative to say about this product.",dogs,3
"Neighborhood cats have been using my backyard for their litter box. And my dog, as some dogs do, would find their feces before I could pick it up. Twice he got very sick and cleaning up his mess was not pleasant. I tried a product recommended by the pet store, but at $20 a carton it became expensive. At a recent visit to our vet, he highly recommended the CatStop. I purchased three, two for my backyard and one for my sister's yard. To date, after 4 weeks, there has been no evidence of cat feces in my backyard. But now I may have to purchase a couple more for my front yard. The unit requires a 9-volt battery, so I keep plenty on hand as I'm not sure how long mine will last.",cats,2

"Our short hair 5 year old male cat, Frankie, loves this food. We give him the dry form. When we moved to a small town and I couldn't find Chicken Soup in any of the stores or even the one Feed Store in town, I bought 1 bag of a brand availible in the grocery store. Boy, if looks could kill! Frankie gave it one sniff, walked off a ways, sat down with his back to me, ears back he turned his head to me --- and his point was very clear... I got right on Amazon and ordered the largest bag of 'Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul'. I chose Chicken Soup initially because it had the highest fiber content of all the cat foods including the more expensive ones. All I knew then about required cat nutrition was the importance of fiber in the diet. The wild ""big cats"" will eat almost everything of what they kill - bone,nails,hoof,fur,tendons,cartlidge along with the soft muscle tissue and some of the internal organs. When I began to look at what most cat foods contained I couldn't beleive I was finding so many grain products in them. I've never seen a cat eat a bowl of corn meal or barley...What!We are all very happy. Frankie has been eating Chicken Soup for 4 of his 5 years and has never been sick, Goes to the vet only for regular checkups and immunizations. The Vet will always remark about how alert,and interested Frankie is in his surroundings. How strong and well muscled; heavy without being fat he is. Frankie is the love or our life (my husband's and mine) and we are thankful to the makers of Chicken Soup for Frankie's vigor,his delight and interest in the world surrounding him. He is playful,kind, making friends with all the neighbors, and is always eager to take part in what ever is going on around the house and yard. Our lives are inriched by Frankie and we beleive his abilities to beneficially influence us, comes from his good health, and his good health comes from Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul.

It also comes with valve controls which are great to adjust the flow of the air through the airstones. It was inexpensive and well worth the purchase.",fish aquatic pets,4
This product was aweful! It started out great and is really quiet as long as you keep the whole filter under water. But it clog's all the time! So I constantly have to unclog it!,fish aquatic pets,4
but my rabbit doesn't seem to be too playful. He threw it across the room once but mostly will just walk up to it and take a nibble. I'd recommend this for someone with a more playful bunny.,bunny rabbit central,1

"The first time I charged the collar, I thought it wasn't working. The light doesn't change from red to green like most collars and there are no instructions to indicate this. After four days of charging I finally called Innotek and they told me that. It works great - she hates when I occasionally need to put it on her, but it does provide peace.",dogs,3
This collar keeps me from stepping on my dog when I get up in the middle of the night. Great product!,dogs,3
"I have tried many brands, and I really like these pads. They absorb well and control smell pretty well. I think these are the best since I use it with the iris tray as well. I love using the tray since it prevents my dog, who loves peeing on the edge, from getting the carpet and hardwood floor. Of course, these pads fit perfect. By themselves, they are a little small but work great with the tray.",dogs,3
This didn't work for us. I sprayed it on my dogs stuff and I couldn't see any difference in her behavior at all.,dogs,3
"Purchased this for my Mini Pin. Very well made. Quick shipping. A little too much stuffing, but you can take some out. Wish it was a little lower to the floor, it is a little difficult for the dog to get on. Looks like it is going to topple over when dog is on one side.",cats,2
"I am thrilled with this product. It took me about 5 seconds to set it up (huge difference from the drop pin crate I was using), and it fits my 20 lb mini schnauzer perfectly. A great deal compared to in store prices at the big chains.",dogs,3

"We did not see any change in our 10 year old American Eskimo. I was hoping to be giving this product a excellent review, but I guess that is not going to be happening in regards to our dog. The product may work for other dogs, but honestly we saw no change in our dog in the past 8 weeks. Best bet I have used up to this point is a coated bayer asprin once or twice a week hidden in some food.",cats,2
"Quality is good, thick material, definately better than I expected. We don't have true headrests on our back seats, but the straps are adjustable so you can adjust as needed. My only negative is I would like a little more fabric between the seat and the back of the front seats. But overall am happy with the product.",dogs,3
"Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.",dogs,3
"It might just be my cat, but no matter what, she seems to be able to jump over these mats rendering them completely useless. We have bought so many of them we are now able to puzzle piece them together making one big, huge mat she can't cross. It's hard to tell which one is doing the job best. It is a cute mat though!",cats,2
"I had my Westie's teeth cleaned by the vet earlier in the year. As much as I tried to keep on top of the brushing, life got in the way and plaque started to build up again. This product has restored his teeth to the way they looked right after the cleaning! And no more ""doggie breath""!",cats,2
"Drinkwell Big-Dog Pet FountainWOW! What a product!! I was using two 1/2 gallon bowls for the kids (7 dogs, 3 cats) and was changing and washing them 2-3 times a day. With the Drinkwell Fountain (Big-Dog) I just fill up the reservoir once or twice a day. The filter keeps the water clean of hair and slobber. Cleaning the fountain is very simple - even my husband can do it! The cats drink exclusively from the stream coming out of the spout. The dogs, being dogs, just DRINK! They seem to drink more water, too. I wish I would have thought of this product, I wouldn't still be a poor but honest landscaper!Thanks again,Mari - Elk, WA",dogs,3

"This is amazing! I have 3 dogs, a cat, and a baby boy, and this gets out every stain imaginable! It takes out stains, and smells, doesnt just cover them up. I have sprayed a pee spot and put my nose in it the next day and cant smell anything. it's the best.",cats,2
"Purchased this for our 8-week old German Shepherd Puppy. She slept with it the first night and then discovered that it was fun to chew. In order to prevent her from leaving stuff all over the house and risk choking, I removed the insert. Now she is happy to carry it around and chew on it. It seems tough enough (so far!) and she does sleep with it, too.",dogs,3
"From what I understand it is a UK manufactured.SnuggleSafe heatpad is ideally for puppies/ kittens and any cherished pet.You simply microwave the SnuggleSafe disc and it will give up to 12 hours of warmth & comfort to any cherished pet.

"Not sure there's anything more to say than that. I had a Littermaid auto box and it was convenient, but the cats were tracking litter around the house. I've seen reviews where people complain about hearing the box during the night. I have heard it. But honestly, if someone were to come into your house at night to remove cat waste and leave you free to do other things, can you complain?? It's like telling a housekeeper to go away and come back later. I live in an old house and it has noises of its own that I tune out. In a few more days I won't even hear it. My 2 cats are happy and so is my family. Sure, the cats had to investigate the thing like it was a UFO landing, but they caught on in one night. This is a great thing for cat owners.",cats,2
"Our cat is 17 lbs so it seemed as though she would shrug out of it. Hard to put on a big cat, due to size and him not holding still. Better for small cats! But did its job while we were moving!",cats,2
"Good product. The dog developed a cataract in one eye over the summer, and it looks like her other eye is close behind. These toys allow us to continue to play fetch, one of her favorite games. She goes after this thing with a vengence. He's about bald on his belly and back, but he still makes noise. I found that getting a couple of different Multipets keeps her from directing ALL of her distructive energy on any one of them. I have a couple on the shelf for when these are finally done in.",dogs,3
"I ordered this as a pet house for my small dogs. It arrive quickly, was easy to put together, and looks nice. However, some of the holes were drilled too big and the bolts would not fit properly. This was for only 2 holes so it does not affect the stability, but buyer beware. The worst part is it has a VERY STRONG chemical smell. My dogs won't go near it and I have had to open a window to help air out the room. Hopefully it will loose the offensive smell.",cats,2
"I bought a pair (not kidding, they sent me two) from an online store and they cost about $20. I was upset and when I contacted the store, there were no returns and they told me they were then out of stock. After that, I looked and looked before deciding where to buy more. I found this deal and paid about $17 for all 4 (I don't know how many dogs have only 2 paws they need covered!) I was so happy. These fit and stay on well!",dogs,3

"I am THRILLED with this bubbler.....no costly filters that get gross and gunky within a week. And, since the pump is not in the water, it doesn't need to be cleaned either. Holds at least a week's worth of water for both of my cats and they love it. The first night they were a bit scared, like they are with anything new, but by the time I got home from work the next day, they'd already make friends with it and drink more than ever. It doesn't get dirty, though dishwasher safe, and is a snap to fill with more water. Couldn't be happier!!!!",cats,2
Our dog loves these things! If I even go near the cabinet they are in she is alert and focused. The peanut butter is her favorite treat.,dogs,3
Over the last 15 years I have tried every brand of carbon out there. From Marinlan to the generic brands even some of the store brands that you buy from Petco or Petsmart.Does this work? Oh yeah quite well in fact. BUT so does the cheap stuff. I have bought 3lb bags of generic carbon from a seller here on Amazon and that stuff works just as well.The difference? On this product they break it all into tiny little bits compared to the cheap stuff is usually in pellet form.personally I have considered even grinding or blending (in a blender) the cheap stuff to see if you can achieve the same consistency as the more prepared stuff from this company or Marineland. Not that I can or can not prove ot really makes any difference.Personally I am going back to the cheap stuff. I clean my filter every two months and replace the carbon then and like I said can't see any difference. At least not one worth paying 5x as much for .,fish aquatic pets,4
Clever design keeps litter from scattering around the outside of the litter box; very sturdy and easy to clean; would highly recommend.,cats,2
"I have bought these before, and they made the difference between getting dragged, and going for a nice walk. I bought one for my foster dog, because he was yanking our shoulders out of the socket when using a regular collar and leash. Now he jogs along side me, and he is a pleasure to take out. Regular choke collars can damage a dog's neck, but this works by pulling them sideways when trying to pull forward, and they have to stop pulling in order to walk forward towards where they want to go. My only complaint is that the adjustments tend to loosen, needing regular adjustment to work effectively.",dogs,3
Seems to work well when I went on vacation but I really cannot be sure. I will keep trying it. DOes not harm the fish at all.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)My dog loves this food. He suffered from some stomach problems when he was a puppy so I switched him to Innova. I loved Innova, but my puppy didn't - his hair became oily, he didn't seem interested in the food, he began to smell bad, and the stomach issues continued. I did more research, switched to Wellness, and everything cleared up! I like the clean ingredients, the way his coat looks, and how he NEVER has bad breath or puppy farts. Ever.",dogs,3

"Very nice product. My cat took to it right away. Does not have an excessive amount of pieces in its makeup, like other pet fountains.The falling stream of water is better than other pet fountains where the water slides down a ramp.

I have two pugs and ordered this ball for Harley's birthday. He is a little afraid of it. He will bat it around with his paws but won't pick it up. My female pug absolutely loves it. She walks around with it in her mouth and rolls around with it. I think it's great!,dogs,3
"First of all, it came with a large furminator. By themselves, they are not cheap, so BIG bonus there!! After that, the pen has more than paid for itself as far as keeping my little pup contained. We use it indoors and outdoors. It has even replaced his crate at the end of the bed. My only complaint is it's not the most solid, but my puppy hasn't even come close to destroying or messing it up, so I guess it's ok for now. Good for small dogs or puppies. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a decent sized pen to hold your furry companion.",dogs,3
These are the best pads I have found for my dogs. They are hard to find at local stores for some reason.,dogs,3
"This is so easy to use with the automatic litter box. With 2 cats it has to be changed about every 10 days. It doesn't leak or have a a discernible odor.

"If you want your previously litter-trained cats to start urinating in a chair in the corner of the room and ruin your hardwood floors, buy this product.Our cats hated it.

"I'm so impressed by these gates! They're such a clever design - very easy to install and use, and they work amazingly well. We have a puppy and a cat and will soon have a baby - these are a terrific way for us to differentiate spaces, and yet allow passage of creatures as appropriate. And taking them down or moving them takes about a minute - yet they're really sturdy and reliable! Anyone that's ever messed with gates that have to be taken down to pass by should really consider investing in these - they're awesome!",dogs,3
Works perfectly and seems to be very reliable. I've had it for about 6 weeks and the food has never clogged or become wet. Consistently delivers the right amount of food each time.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I was ready to shell out $299.00 for an automatic litter box and decided to try this first. Sure glad I did. This box is amazing. I can't recommend it highly enough! Our cat started using it on the first day. It is extremely easy to clean, and because of that, the cat has a clean box all of the time. I would highly recommend this, and spend the extra money you save on an automatic box on something fun!",cats,2
"Great for use indoors, like hotels and malls, but the wheels are very cheap plastic with no real wearability for sidewalks or crossing streets. I have a 15lb dog, which allows me to have about 10lbs of cargo in the basket under the main carriage space. It is lightweight and does fold like a baby stroller for trunk storage. My dog learned very quickly how to jump into and out of the easy opening back. It looks nice and was simple to put together, even though one of the round tubes got a bit bent in shipping (if that had not happened, then it would have taken 5 minutes to put together). The handle bar is comfortable.If you just want to put your dog in and walk with purpose or excerice in mind, then you better make a sign saying so. Your dog in this buggie is going to get a lot of attention and you will be asked questions about the product and your reason for using it. My dog is very well behaved and is used to rock star status that this product only enhances. :)Final note, I am glad I bought this for my trip to New Orleans, it helped move my dog safely while attending a convention of about 1500 people in the hotel. However, for at home use, where sidewalks are few, and sandy dirt drifts on the roads, it will not do so well. The product instructions note that this is not ment for beach use. I agree!",cats,2
"I have two of these for my two fairly large dogs (80 lb. Lab, 75 lb. Vizsla). The dogs love them, they have used them daily for ~5 years now and the frame and fabric material show no signs of wear. Occasionally you need to tighten the screws holding the frame together, but not more than once or twice a year. I have another dog and will buy another Coolaroo Dog bed for her, once I figure out which size is appropriate.",cats,2
"I just wanted to comment on some of the reviews and animals that are living in this cage (which I don't own)...degu's and rats in this cage? Degu's full grown are the size of softballs, and one person has 5 in this cage? I have 3 rats currently housed in a 4 level 32w x 18d x 36h cage, I wouldn't even use one this size for travel for a single rat. Just stating that this cage at 14 x 11 x 12 is not in any way appropriate for rats/degus or any animals of like size. Dwarf hamsters or mice are the only animals this cage will really house without stress on the animal.",small animals,5

"First, let me say that 5 gallons is a LOT heavier than I thought it would be. :) As an outside waterer though, this is the bees knees. The dogs and cats will both drink from it, I've seen our little wild bunnies getting close to it, but I don't know if they've actually used it. Water stays cool, bowl doesn't get slimy...all in all, I'm quite happy with the purchase so far. We'll see how the plastic holds up to a Texas summer.All that said; I think this would be a monster to have *in* the house, unless you've got a really large kitchen, and you don't mind cleaning up the little spillage you're likely to have when you tip the full bottle into the holder part. Also...seriously, it's heavy when it's full. Assume about 7 pounds a gallon for water, so it's 45 pounds when full.The giant size is perfect for our 200 pounds of dog and 30 pounds of cats (plus whatever wildlife is wandering around out there), but it's WAY more than you need for small animals.",cats,2
"I gave this to my Scottie to play with not knowing whether he would be interested in figuring out the game. It didn't take him long to figure it out. He loves it and wants to play with it over and over and I get tired of putting the bees back in the hive. I am very impressed with the durability of the toy, especially since Scotties are known for their strong teeth and jaws and my dog loves squeaker toys and really puts this product to the test. Have had it about a year and the toy has held up well.",dogs,3
This is a very good dog jacket. Bought it for our new Goldendoodle puppy. Went ahead and bought the large. It is a little big but he will grow into it quickly. Only complaint was there was not enough sizing information on the product description. Looked through the reviews and someone was nice enough to put on the sizes. The product is great. Usually these things are cheap looking but this actually has some sturdiness to it. Would recommend.,dogs,3
"I love my dog, and as such I really didn't feel comfortable with shock collars... however, living in an apartment, we couldn't have him barking every time someone knocked on our door. So, we simply put the collar on when we knew someone was coming over. After two or three sprays, all we had to say was ""Collar!"" and he would know not to bark. DO NOT keep it on all the time! Your dog needs to vocalize! However, it's great for addressing instances of nuisance barking.",dogs,3

Door is poorly designed and of marginal quality. Problems include:- in a mild breeze door fly's like a kite (opens wide)- door attaching hardware is very poor (plastic or nylon)Really disappointed in the installation and overall quality of the dog door. In a minor wind it might as well not be there. Had to re-engineer installation with new hardware to make more robust. Really not worth the cost.,dogs,3
"I have a bulldog puppy and while he's been good with his puppy pads he does have a few accidents. So I purchased this thing thinking it would help me find any spots I may have overlooked or missed. To my surprise I didn't find anything at all, then while I was thinking to myself .. wow he really is doing outstanding with his house training I saw him pee on his pad but on the very edge and about half of it went right onto the carpet. Hey what a great opportunity to finally see what pee looks like with this thing. Guess what... it didn't show anything at all ! That's why I didn't see anything before... because this thing totally doesn't work at all. It's a massive waste of money. Don't waste your time or money on this thing. I ended up calling a professional company that had a device that looks a lot like this thing but literally lit up the 3 spots I missed like a Christmas tree. I was shocked, then pissed off at the 20 minutes I was crawling around my living room looking for spots with a useless novelty toy disguised as a tool. AVOID THIS THING !",cats,2
We have been giving these to our dogs for some time now. And they absolutely work! We have a 13 year old Samoyed with severe arthritis and an 8 year old pit bull with hip problems. And without these chewables both dogs would barely get up from their beds. I would recommend this product.,dogs,3

It has a very large reservoir and you can adjust the speed the water comes out. We've had it set up for about 3 days now. It's not very loud, but when its quiet in the apartment, the motor makes a slight buzz. Our cat also likes it and has had no trouble adapting to the running water. If he likes it, we like it.",cats,2

"I have a 30 lb sheltie who loves to play tug-o-war. She's always running to her toy box to pick up this ""fleece"" tug toy to let me know she wants to play with me (this and her Coleman ""bear rug"" toy, her favorite tugs). She hops and tugs and shakes her end of the tug toy to her heart's content. She loves this tug so much that she'll simply hold onto one end while I hold the other end in one hand, and do chores with my free hand. It's like walking her around in the house with a leash, only it's a fleece tug in her mouth.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully. Also, she doesn't play with this toy on her own if I don't play with her.This toy is long enough that it's actually better for my back, as I can hold onto my end while my knee-high sheltie grabs hold of the other end, and I don't have to bend over (I'm 5'9""). Each end has a squeaker, which still function after two months of play.I'm glad I bought it! It gets daily play at my house, it's clearly one of my dog's Top Two favorites. I have other Premier toys and am very happy with their longevity and their design.**UPDATE** I've now had this toy for 3 months, and neither of the squeakers work anymore. They can't be replaced, but I'm still glad I purchased this toy, my dog still loves it even though it doesn't squeak.**UPDATE #2** I bought a second tug toy, and this one had its long seam come undone within the first day. Manufacturing defect, pleh. My girl and boy shelties still play with the first, older tug toy, it has holes in it that I put kibble in to add renewed interest to the toy.",dogs,3
"I bought this for my very territorial papillon. She is obviously very bothered by the ultrasonic noise and immediately quits barking and hides whenever it goes off. However, it rarely goes off on its own. I usually have to press the manual control to get her to shut up. Sometimes it'll automatically go off (and sometimes it goes off at nothing) but it doesn't seem to be able to differentiate between barking and other noises very well. The good thing about it is that I can easily take it off of the wall where I mounted it and carry it around the house with me. So, if I have company, I just need to keep it near me so I can set it off whenever she starts barking at this unwanted guest.",dogs,3

"Great collar. Cute design. My (BAD) dog chewed in half in about a day. I leave his collar loose in case his sister gets ahold of it, it won't choke him as quickly. So, he was able to get to it and chewed it in half. This would have (and has) happened with almost any nylon collar, so it is not a reflection on the collar. Good news- I mailed it to Lupine along with my address and I had a new one in about a week! No hassle, no phone calls, no charges, no questions. I tightened it up and I've had no problems.",dogs,3

If anything entertains her for more than a half an hour, it's amazing!",dogs,3
"I just wanted to write a review to let people are considering buying this collar know that it is BRIGHT yellow. It is almost neon. The collar is great, but a little big on my 3 month old cat. She hasn't tried to wiggle out of it yet, so that's a good sign.",cats,2

I have 5 rats in a large cage, and all pile up together inside the nest. It's funny seeing heads, feet, and tails sticking out of a nest! I line the nests with nesting materials to keep it fresh longer. If you have 4 or more rats a Giant size nest is best. There are also medium size nests for fewer or small rats. I use a large safety pin to anchor the nest to the top wire shelf as the rat love being on the highest shelf. Try the grassy nests; your rat friends will love you for it.",bunny rabbit central,1

I had a Maine Coon with horribly bad arthritis in his jounts ......... I noticed after a few weeks of using this product he seemed to have less pain and walked better. I think it works well - but I would go by whatever dose your vet doctor recommends over what the package states,dogs,3
The colors are great and it is very sturdy. I plan on using this to walk dogs at the local animal shelter and it is much easier to use than a traditional leash and collar.,dogs,3

"I got this collar because we had a reflective braided leash (that we got from Walmart) that was the best leash we've ever tried and I thought this reflective braided collar would be great too (even though it wasn't from the same company). However, this collar also has an unbraided portion, which is the weakest link in this case. The braided part is strong enough (although not as strong as the Walmart leash we had) but beyond that, the unbraided portion was flimsy. Not only would the end of the collar beyond the buckle keep slipping out, but the rings on the unbraided portion would break off and that portion would start to fray, so we had to replace it because the collar was slipping off every time our dog pulled hard on it when leashed.I could see this collar lasting longer for a small dog, but we have a strong 60-lb dog that will pull against the leash sometimes and this collar just couldn't withstand that.",dogs,3

I love that this disposable box makes cat cleanup something that the kids can do (since they wanted the cat in the first place). The fact that it fits in a standard size trash bag means no additional expense of cat box liners. WE LOVE THIS! Will be switching to order the Jumbo box since our cat is so huge though.,cats,2

"I have two cats and an automatic food dispenser. I have it set to dispense 1/4 cup at a time so that one of my cats cannot eat until he pukes. Unfortunately, my dispenser only allows me to dispense food 3 times a day. While the food they eat is dense and high quality, the fact is that 3/4 of a cup of food distributed between two sedentary house cats isn't quite enough. I had taken to manually giving them a couple small ""snacks"" during the day, but then they began to beg me for food.With this toy, I can load the ball with 1/4 cup of food and leave it out for them at night. They push it all over and nibble whenever the mood strikes them. They seem to find it entertaining. They no longer pester me for food at odd times. This was a great way to solve a slight underfeeding problem. It allowed me to give them a controlled portion of food AND a little game to play at the same time. They actually eat less than they would if I just put 1/4 cup of food into their bowl. It seems to fill some need inside them to ""stalk"" their food and then eat it. Even when they eat out of boredom, they eat a lot less because they have to work for it.",cats,2
"If my kittens were reviewing this, they would give it 5 stars! They really love playing with the ball and occasionally use the scratcher part in the middle. I give it 4 stars because oh-my-heck it is noisy when they really get to playing with it. I defintely think it's worth the money I paid for it!",cats,2
We have a 10 lb silky terrier who was not potty trained and marked every corner and wall he could find. The new carpet got not so new real fast. We bought the 100 pads for $25 or so and trained him to go on the pads. He used to like the pads so much he just lied down on it. After getting him trained the pads held up very well. If the pee went straight onto the padded part the pad soaked it up well as expected.Our silky terrier is also getting old so he can't hold it like he used to. Sometimes he walks around the house back and forth and then starts to let it go when he's walking. So our solution to that and his need to mark his area was to use the regular sized pads as a diaper. For a 10 lb dog cutting the pads into thirds is the perfect size to cover his bottom half. Wrap him with a sports wrap w/ velcro and no more yellow-stained carpet! He eventually learned that trying to mark things with the pad on only got him wet and stinky. Once in a while (when he can't hold it) he pees while the pad is on and 99% of the time it doesn't leak out. It works great! Your dog's results may vary though depending on the amount of pee.So for us this product is 100 regular pads and/or 300 diaper uses.,dogs,3
It makes cleaning up after 2 cats so much easier than before. It's not a perfect system--sometimes clean litter ends up in the tray--but it makes it much easier to do multiple clean-ups and keep the box clean throughout the day.,cats,2
I thought this was like the as seen on TV product and it turned out to be a piece of plastic sheet with holes. The plastic sheets are so thin that after one day you go and try to pick the clumps of litter and the sheet breaks dropping all the litter back in the litter box. Now you have to use a second sheet and if you skip a day you will need to use 3 or 4 sheets so you end up using most of the 24 sheets in a month time. The litter cost me $11 and I use that in 1 month so why would I spend an additional $13 for this product for more work when I could just throw the whole thing every weekend! That plus the shipping is as much as the product cost makes it useless. Ended up going to Frys and getting the Seen on TV(forgot the name) and that worked much better. For one the bottom of the other product is a very strong mesh that actually works and you only use one even if you skip a day.Hate writing bad reviews but I love great products and readily pay for the ones that work but don't like ones that claims they have a good product and don't!!!,cats,2
"We had to put our collie in a confined space in our yard for a couple of days during construction. The first two days she was being eaten alive - there were hordes of flies swarming in her ears, her back, just everywhere. This collar solved the problem right away! No flies, no bugs, nothing! That's without spraying the area of the yard or anything. This product is really great and a terrific value!",dogs,3
"I thought the Littermaid was a good idea, but in the last 3 months --- my 2 cats have used it only 3 or 4 times. I put it next to my ""regular"" litter box (as the instructions suggested,) but no cigar. Ultimately, I was afraid to remove the old box for fear the cats wold poop on the floor, and pee in the corner.On paper, the Littermaid sounds terrific. I bought it because my sister-in-law said it was the greatest. Later, I asked my sister-in-law if her 2 cats used it, and she said ONLY ONE did. (Wish I'd asked before.) So, for me, I wish I had my money back.",cats,2
"This lead is perfect for taking my dog to the beach, it gives her enough freedom to run around yet allows me to keep her from running into the road after the joggers/bikers. This is definitely not meant to keep your dog tied up in the yard, not that you should anyway, but I could see a dog quickly chewing through it and getting tangled up! Just be careful, if your dog pulls too hard it cab give you a major burn!",dogs,3
"This litter box is everything it claims to be and then some! My 15 year old cat, who is afraid of any type of noise, actually used it without any hesitation. It is really quiet! I actually think she likes it because her litter box is always clean. I was able to go away for a week and all my ""sitter"" had to do was put some fresh litter in the tray and dump the grocery bag with the waste into the trash.The best thing about the Simply Clean Litter Box is the customer service/warranty. The motor developed a slight ""whine"" so I called customer service. They shipped another motor out (got it in 2 days), I replaced it in 2 minutes, and the litter box was back in business. I received a followup call from customer service a few days later, just to make sure everything was working fine.",cats,2
"It's a black 50"" cotton lead. My dog is a little on the small side though, so the clasp seems a bit heavy duty for her. It would be better for a medium to large dog. The clasp is sturdy though and its held up well after a couple months.",dogs,3
"Unfortunately, my little dog is between 6 and 7 lbs. so based on reviews of the small Snoozer Console Car Seat, I chose to try the large seat. I have a RAV4 SUV and this size is way too big.

Based on the stated dimensions, the small should just barely fit. Will update if it works!",dogs,3
"I am a little irritated because when I bought this... PINK WAS NOT AVAILABLE! :( But this item is so great that I will deal with black, but I wish pink had been available before I'd purchased this! The bags are wonderful but I would bring napkins with you also because for me its super gross to feel poop and you can feel it through the bags! I can deal with it but Id rather not! I clip this right onto my belt loop or the bag I carry and just pull one right out. This seems hard to do at first with one hand but the more you get the hang of it its much easier to hang on to a crazy pulling puppy and still take on right out of the dispenser. If you walk your dog this is a great idea. I HATE people who do not pick up their dogs waste. So buy these! I would leave the house all the time and completely forget to get a bag.. well what can you do when your already out? Nothing, how embarrassing! I keep this right with my dogs leash and harness and off we go and I have never forgot it!",dogs,3
"I was so excited when my Drinkwell arrived... I have 3 large dogs and I was constantly having to wash and refill their large water bowl. This item has made my dogs and myself very happy! The water is fresh and clean all the time. However, one of my Boxers drools a little and I've found that when there's a little white ""drool-cloud"" floating on the surface of the water, I simply use a coffee cup to scoop it out and it's back to clean. I refill the jug once a day, as I swear they are drinking quite a bit more water per day than before (which is GREAT!). I put the whole fountain in the sink once a week and clean it thoroughly, but haven't needed to try the dishwasher, since it's so simple to wash. I think the filters are quite helpful, I just rinse them and replace every 2-3 weeks.My only criticism is that the clear plastic water ""jug"" on the back arrived dented and although I popped out the dent, it's still creased. I wish it was made with thicker plastic. As I'm refilling it once a day... I'm wondering how long it will be until it cracks.",dogs,3

Adding this product to my dogs' food has done wonders to help their Colorado dry skin. Both are recently rescued Eskies that came to me with itch and coats in poor condition. A friend who works with dogs professionaly even commented that my dogs don't shed as much as other Eskies she sees. I attribute it to this salmon oil. It is also a good supplement for eye and brain health and the dogs love the taste. Just ordered another bottle.,dogs,3
Extremely pleased with the pad. Sturdy and good quality. Porch feral cat I rescued loves it. At first placed the pad in a box but now have in a plastic dog house. The pad is just slightly warm until she sits on it and then warms up to keep her snug. I am confident this pad will keep her through the winter.,cats,2
"I purchased one a few months ago for my cat because she was eating very fast and always seemed to be hungry and want more food. I didn't want her to become overweight and so I hoped this would make her eat slower and also get in a little exercise. This product is great! My cat figured out how to use it in about 1 minute and I feed her all her meals in it. I also bought 2 more for my mom and sister's cats. They both told me they love it too. The only thing I'd change is I wish there were a few more size options for the food to come out of, but overall this is a great feeder ball. Every cat could benefit from one even if they don't need to loose weight - it makes them think and keeps them entertained!",cats,2
"Ethical Pet Wide Durable Heavy Gauge Plastic Colorful Springs Cat Toy, 10-PackThis is a favorite in our house. One of our four kitties will play with nothing else but his springs. He even knows the word ""spring,"" where we keep them, and where they get lost. He'll play for hours chasing his spring around the house, and has even taught himself how to play fetch with it (he brings it to us and cries until we throw it for him). This is the only toy he plays with, and turns into a little stinker when he doesn't have one available. We keep them hidden and give him one at a time to sate his boredom.I've read reviews with concerns of breakage and ingestion, and can honestly say this has never been an issue in our home. Two of our cats (aged 1 year and 6 months) play with them frequently. The one-year-old has a tendency to try to eat non-food items, yet he has no interest in anything but playing with the springs. Naturally, all cats are different and should be supervised.Overall this is a great value for a great cat toy. I keep these on my Amazon shopping list for quick access now, when our springs (inevitably) go missing.",cats,2
"Our Jack Russell is a real chow hound and just `wolves' down her food. We now serve Wendy all her dinners in the Tug-a-Jug. At first she was quite frustrated but we mixed some small kibble with the regular size and she was rewarded enough to keep working on it. Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15-20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast. Some reviewers didn't like the plastic rope in this newer version, but I find it cleans up easier and does not become frayed.",dogs,3
"The thermometer I received was horizontal rather than vertical (as shown in the Amazon stock picture). I took a picture of the one I received and posted it in case anyone was interested. I think that it being horizontal is better as it is kind of long.Anyway, as for the quality of the thermometer, it is great! It makes reading the temperature very easy to read! Also, it is removable for you to reposition as necessary. I have 2 tanks and I wanted to know what this thermometer was reading for both and I had no issues moving it back and forth.",fish aquatic pets,4
"As a thermometer, it seems to work fine.But if you're using it in a acrylic tank, DON'T USE THE SUCTION CUP! It left two permanent ring shaped marks on my tank, after about a month of use.

It was so easy and took such a small amount of time I will order the same thing again.6/2011 - I ordered this item again at a good price and quick delivery.

"As soon as I took this thing out of the package, my cat went crazy. She loves this thing! Chasing, stalking, biting, flipping, you name it, she does it. I don't know what it is that she finds so appealing, but she does. I have bought plenty of toys similar to this one in the past & they all end up in the unused pile. The ribbon thing on this toy is multi-colored & made of some sort of soft, felty, blankety material & is attached to a simple (but sturdy) plastic stick. That's it! No catnip, no tricks or surprises, no lasers that dart out across the room, just simplicity, and it's perfect.",cats,2

I'll be donating it to the cat shelter.",cats,2
"When my 2 cats found me and took over my household (and heart), the one thing I dreaded was cleaning up after them. Thankfully they came to me already trained to use a litter box, but I still didn't even like the idea of having to wash and clean a litter box - doing toilets is enough. I originally found The Kitty Wonderbox in a grocery store. I liked the idea of just adding litter to the box, scooping when needed, and then when it would normally be time to wash and clean a real box, this you just threw away and started with a new one. They are biodegradeable and I use one a month based on the Wonderbox instructions and my own cats usage. My cats have no problem using the box and there has never been an ""accident"". I do know there is a larger size Wonderbox available if you have a super kitty, but for a normal size cat, you should be fine with this. If you don't like to soap, water, sterilze a plastic box, this is the answer. Also good to carry on trips.",cats,2
This litter box is great! Great price and better than any other one I have purchased. I was thinking about getting the robot one but what a waste of money that would have been! This one does just fine ; ),cats,2
"For the first day this collar worked great. It startled my small dog when she barked and I really think she would have learned not to bark had the collar worked for more than a day. When we put it on her the next day, it simply didn't work. I was so disappointed. We thought perhaps it needed to be refilled but no,it just failed to work. I have requested another collar to be sent, I'd like to give it another try. Perhaps this one was defective.",dogs,3

We owned this ball for about a year before it disappeared recently.Emma is a 50 lb lab/pit mix, not a huge dog, but an aggressive chewer. She has eaten meals out of it, rolled it around to get treats out of it, played fetch with it, caught it off a big bounce, swam after it, chewed on it, and slept next to it. ",dogs,3
"As far as I can tell, it works as advertised. We only used it once while we were gone from the house and my cat didn't eat (stress I think). We have to use wet food though and the ice pack didn't last as long as I'd hoped. We were gone overnight and the ice wasn't cold when we got home, we threw out the food that the cat didn't eat. So if someone can come in to change the ice, it would work. There must be a way to do it where it would last longer, but we've just had someone come feed the cat instead. If someone knows of a way, please let me know!",cats,2

"Our dog considers herself a homeowner, she loves her den.We got this 30""L x 23""W x 24""D model that is much larger than needed for a 4 lb chihuahua/toy poodle mix because smaller cat-type ones don't cut it and are way to confining for at-home use. (we have a small one for in the car)We can't let her run around the house when we have to leave; although we only leave for 3 hours at a time she is too small to have free reign over the house, so for her safety we put her in her own doggie house. She doesn't mind it and is usually sleeping when we get home.I wouldn't want her to stay in something that she wouldn't want to go in on her own, and sure enough she goes in this crate on her own to take naps even while we're home and we just leave the door open.I'm happy with the purchase. Strong quality bars & the plastic tray should last. Amazon charged $49 w/ free shipping which was about half what local and mart pet stores I researched were charging for this size and quality. The crate was very easy to set up with the Drop-Pin system(under 5 minutes) but it is really a 2 man operation.",dogs,3
"I was unsure how my new kitten would like to drink from a ""fountain"", the first week I had it he would just look at it, eventually as he got a little older he started experimenting with the water (dipping his paw in ocassionally). Well he started to drink from it (both at the base and top of the waterfall) and he loves it now!!! I would NEVER go back to unfiltered, stale and stagnent water. Every cat and dog should have one of these WONDERFUL devices. I think that this is the best model because it has both a charcoal filter and a water pressure gauge. The sleek black and stainless steel goes great with a stainless steel food dish. Plus you have the satisfaction that your animal is getting clean, fresh water on a daily basis, what more could a pet owner want! I highly reccomend that you buy this product, I would even suggest getting one as a gift for a friend that is a pet owner! Everyone should own one! Enjoy!",cats,2

I know dogs are not human, but a product that has that scent cannot possibly be good for the dog. I went to petco and got some supplies including wellness puppy treats. He loved them so much I decided to quickly switch to this dog food. No transition just fed it to him, he loves it, eats more, and has absolutely no problems. I am happy with the ingredient list.

"The Furminator is great. I was skeptical about spending so much money on a brush/comb for the dog because I see so many in the stores for much less, but a friend had recommended the Furminator. We are really happy with it, it truly is worth the money. We have seen a decrease of hair in the house since we have begun using the Furminator. Would definitley recommend.",cats,2
"This is a great product. We live on 45 acres and have had problems with fleas, ticks, bull ants, wasps, and spiders. My husband sprays the yard about once a month, I spray the dogs each week and our horses when needed. You can not use it on cats. Our tick problem was so bad we could not walk outside without getting 10 or more ticks on us. We have a lot of deer that walk through our property which was a big part of our problem. It is so nice to go outside in bare feet and not covered with bug spray. I can buy this locally for $22 so this is a good buy. The delivery time was fast too. I have just started using it on dirt dabbers and wasps, works great on them too.",dogs,3
"I have been measuring my cats food for years due to the fact that she is a bit overweight. So this saved me a bunch of time....Then we adopted 2 new kittens so we bought a second one to keep their food separate from the ""fat"" cats... :)~ It is perfect! No problems at all....",cats,2

"I think this cat food is better than the mainstream, agribusiness brands but it still has &#34;chicken meal&#34; as one of its chief components.

"I wanted to find a good skin and coat supplement for my Whippet since they only have a single coat and their skin is more exposed to the elements. I had been feeding him Halo's wet and dry food so when I saw the great reviews for Dream Coat I didn't think twice about ordering it. I wasn't quite as educated about dog health at the time, but I did read the ingredients list and thought it seemed ok. After a few weeks of mixing the supplement with his food it didn't seem to help at all. His skin was red, and he was constantly itching his eyes and ears. We took him to the vet twice, they gave us some allergy pills and sent us home. Well after 2 expensive vet bills I decided to change his food hoping it would help. I switched to Wellness Stew wet food which my puppy loves. I then decided to take a closer look at his supplement program and discovered the first ingredient of the Dream Coat was soybean oil! I've read that a lot of dogs are allergic to soy so we stopped giving him the supplement immediately and lo and behold- his itchy-ness has reduced some. I'm mad because I was giving this to him for his health and in the end it ended up hurting him more. I wish I would have looked at the ingredients closer. And to top it off- the halo healing salve that I bought to help with the itching also has soybean oil in it! We have since stopped buying all Halo products.",cats,2
"After reading the reviews and losing all of my security deposit (and then some) from my last apartment due to my cat's constant scratching of the woodwork, I decided to try this item. I really had my doubts about my luck with it as my cat can be very fussy about being directed to do anything like where to scratch. At 1st, as some dissatisfied users reported, my cat showed absolutely no interest in the post. When he would scratch the woodwork, I would place him at the post and he not only showed no interest in the post, but even retracted his claws as a further insult.I thought ""another waste of money."" Then I remembered that one of the posts I read in the reviews was from a lady who had the same disinterested reaction from her cat and who enticed her cat to scratch the post by teasing the cat with his favorite swinging cat toy on top of and around the post. Feeling I had nothing to lose, I gave it a try and I simply couldn't believe it. The cat dug his claws deep into the post while swatting at the cat toy and the rest is history. He became so interested in the scratching post that he forgot the toy. Afterwards, he tried to scratch the walls only a few times and just saying ""no' sent him to the nearby cat toy. Another good recommendation I read was to place the scratching post near where most of his scratching behavior usually takes place.I also want to comment on how sturdy this item is. It only took about a minute or so to assemble and is solidly constructed and not likely to tip over. I have a huge Ragdoll cat over 20 pounds of muscle and he hasn't knocked it over yet and he vigorously uses the post now. Sorry for this being so lengthy, but I hope it can help someone who, like me, was a sceptic and at first thought this isn't going to work. Thanks to whomever posted the hint about using the cat toy to provoke interest in the post. You saved me a lot of heartache.",cats,2

I purchase this product about 3 months ago and must say that I am very pleased with it. I have 2 sixteen months old akitas and I had them chained up for most of the times because they were not trained and I was scared of them running away or even hurting someone. I really did not like to see them chained up in captivity so I solicited the help of a dog trainer to assist me with them and after several training he recommended the Inotek system to keep the dogs on the property. This product is amazing.....my dogs stay on the property and are able to roam free. I am now a very happy dog owner. My dogs greet me in the evenings when I arrive home and i can see that they are enjoying their freedom tremendously. I just recently got 2 other pups so I will be using the same Inotek system to keep them on the premises. My only regret is not knowing about this great product before...I could have saved my dogs a lot of discomfort and myself a lot of worry. I would recommend this product highly and I give it 5 stars.!!!!!!!Thank you Inotek for such a GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!! and amazon for having this product available for purchase.,dogs,3
"I get most of my fish through mail order. By the time they get to me they are often starting to show symptoms of any disease they've EVER been exposed to. This helps. I have successfully treated fish with ich, fin rot and body fungus.You do need to keep the treatments up, though - just putting in a dose for one day won't be enough. The directions are to use one capful for every 10 gallons daily. ""Repeat as long as required as long as fish show no signs of stress."" You can also use this as a preventative dip for new fish (which I highly, HIGHLY recommend) by putting half a capful per gallon of the dip.The good news is that not only do you not have to take the charcoal out of your filter and you do not have to worry about snails or shrimp, either. I did a heavy series of doses on one tank that had cherry shrimp in it, and not one died or even looked sick.If you keep fish, you really need to have medications on hand to treat them when something breaks out. Early treatment is key. I keep this and maracyn 2 on hand so I can nip diseases in the bud. Prazipro has a good reputation, too, but I have not tried that.Maybe there is a better broad spectrum treatment available than ParaGuard, but I have not found it yet. I would definitely like to hear people's feedback if they've found something that works better.By the way, this is what the bottle says",fish aquatic pets,4
"We purchased this item on a lightening deal before Christmas and paid about $40. I'm glad we didn't pay any more than that. Our cats have several scratching posts around the house and the bases are all covered with carpet. On this new ""Smart Cat"" Scratching Post, the base is hard plastic, slick and slippery. The cats can't get a foot hold with their back paws or claws when they stand up on it to scratch. They have tried standing off of the slick base to scratch the post with their front claws, but it's awkward for them. They've also tried laying on top of the base to scratch the post with their front paws, but they slide around on the hard plastic surface. As a result, they now just ignore this item. We are going to try and cover the base with carpet ourselves. If this doesn't work, we may end up donating it to a local shelter.",cats,2

"My new rescue dog had constant mushy stools. The vet treated him for worms even though he showed no signs of them, gave him antibiotics and prescription canned food. This is when I found out that it was dry food that caused his stomach problems. Dry food is much harder to digest than canned. I then found prozyme and it solved the problem. Wish I had tried it before I spent a fortune at the vet. Rawhide is especially hard to digest and would always bring back the diarrhea. Now after eating rawhide I give him a little prozyme and all is fine. It only takes 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon per cup of food so a bottle lasts a long time. If you dog has stomach problems give it a try. I tried several other products and this is the first thing that worked.",cats,2

"I had purchased a healthy, happy pedigree Boston Terrier puppy who, once reached 4-6 mos of age, developed a rather severe case of Demodex. After going to vet and being prescribed serious, heavy duty topically-toxic prescriptions (oral meds with and frequent poisonous dips to kill the parasites) I opted to research the problem on my own to find a holistic cure -- and discovered the parasites/mites survive on the skin, appear like mange and are actually dependent on yeast that ultimately comes from the dog's diet and needs to be treated topically with Neem Oil shampoo.I modified the diet to a solely organic reliable food source (found at website FlintRiver dot com) that provided only foods found in a dog's natural (pre-domesticated) enviornment. They abstain totally from all manner of artificial preservatives, yeast, enzymes, etc. Storebought dog foods fed and maintained the mites/Demodex condition by including ingredients counter to a healthy diet for dogs. The external therapy relied on the weekly use of neem oil shampoo, a natural botanical oil that the mites could not tolerate. After a month of diet and shampoo therapy, my dog had extremely noticable and positive results - after three months, the condition was 98% resolved. By the time my puppy was 1yr old, he had totally overcome his Demodex condition and is healthy, happy and chemical free.I continue to use this organic neem-oil shampoo exclusively to keep my dogs safe from fleas and ticks in the summer and it works great in that regard as well as keeps my dogs' coats soft, shiney, clean and fresh smelling. I also continue to feed them Flint River dog food since a healthy, organic diet is the best preventative for good healthcare. Also, I have peace of mind knowing I'm feeding my dogs USA-made, USA cultivated organic, human-grade quality food ingredients found in Flint River dog food. Saftey issues with pet food ingredient-sources and subsequent pet food recalls are a real concern and one we don't have to worry about with Flint River.",dogs,3
"If your dog has 'stinky collar syndrome', this is the answer! Our dog, a six year old Golden, had smelled so bad for so long that we thought it was her. It turned out to be her collars after they had gotten wet from her frequent swims. This is the only collar we've ever tried that after two months and many swims later, has no smell whatsoever! The collar is holding up perfectly and the functionality of the 'Fido' tag doesn't concern me. Unfortunately, there is a definite glitch with sizing on these collars. For some reason, there are gaps between the sizes. When our dog's 16 1/2"" neck size wasn't covered in their sizing chart, Teafco's customer service suggested ordering a large and it wasn't even close to fitting. So we ordered a medium and it barely fit. Get past the sizing issue and this is a great collar!",dogs,3

I was impressed with the weight of this football when I held it. After about 20 minutes of playing with this football, he already started chewing off the fabric so now we only let him have it when we are playing with him or he would sit and chew on the whole thing until it's ruined. Hopefully we can get a little extra life out of it this way! I don't know that I would purchase another one in the future with the same fabric on it.",dogs,3

I simply pull one of the eggs out, squeak it, and put it back in the slit. They LOVE working to get the eggs out. One of my dogs is obsessed with balls and tosses around the eggs like a ball once he gets it out. I highly recommend this toy and am very pleased with the purchase.",dogs,3

"My German Shepherd mix pup Lucy used to scarf her food so we bought her the Kong Wobbler in an attempt to slow her down. We usually put half her meal in her food bowl and half in the Wobbler and it has definitely slowed her down. She definitely has fun trying to get her food out, although we don't have as much fun listening to her kick it around and into walls for 30 minutes, I guess it's worth it if she's happy! We'll probably end up buying her a special bowl to slow her down to we don't have to listen to the banging (she gets realllly into trying to get that food out) but she still enjoys the Wobbler so we'll keep it in use.The opening is big enough to get her food out, but her food has large chunks (Purina One) that get stuck, so she pushes it around into walls and furniture until we open it to help get her food out.",dogs,3

"I've had this thing for five or six years and nothing has broken (I'm rather impressed as I thought it would). It jams occasionally if my cat just peed like a racehorse; scoop it up with a litter scoop, put it in the bin and cycle the power switch - ten whole seconds. Litter does collect beneath the waste bin and that's annoying. My cat tracks litter onto the floor and there's no avoiding that. I keep a whisk and dust pan next to the box. It's a little noisy; shut it off at night if it bothers you. The containers are expensive and thus can be lined with a plastic shopping bag (one with no holes). One box of plastic bins lasts over a year for me. It needs cleaning periodically, too, for your cat's health. I know of no maintenance-free litter box. The Littermaid not perfect but way better than the old way. I've been happy enough with it to buy another for a second cat. BTW, the silicone spray on the tines that someone mentioned??

"We've had really great success with this kit. It's plenty sturdy enough (my cat is 10lbs though so he's small) and the perforated rings are very gradual. Also, I've found that if you move too fast, it's not irreparable, just save each ring as you cut it off in case you've moved too fast and if you have (as my cat showed me by peeing in my mother's potted plant) just duct tape the last ring you cut off back in place. My cat was completely toilet trained using this kit in 4 weeks - well in advance of what the kit said. I think the key is just to see how comfortable your cat is with each step - if he's avoiding the bathroom, then he's not comfortable. My cat would examine each stage we moved to with great curiosity and was always willing to try it and only once tried to go to the bathroom elsewhere. So that's how I could tell he was comfortable enough to move him along quicker than the kit recommended. And in the 4 weeks that it took him to be completely toilet trained, we went from my apartment to my parents' house (for winter break as I'm a student) and back to my apartment and then to a new apartment so my cat had to switch and adapt to 3 different bathrooms during those 4 weeks and still managed to be completely toilet trained in that time. He is a pretty confident, curious, adaptable little guy though so I don't think all cats would have dealt with toilet training and moving 3 times as well as he did, but I really think this kit is wonderful because the rings are gradual (compared to litter kwitter), it's really very cheap if you think about what you're saving in litter (and if you compare it to the litter kwitter which was the other kit I looked at), and it's super easy to use. To cut the rings, I would use a utility knife to cut part of it so that I could then get my scissors in there and cut the rest of it. The only problem that I've run into is that my cat likes to play in the toilet water (and drink it even though he has a flowing fountain available at all times) and now that he's litter trained, I can't just close the lid to keep him out of it so right now, I have to keep a couple of teaspoons of vinegar in the toilet water at all times (cats hate vinegar so it works to deter him although it's kind of annoying because I have to do it every time I flush) but it's so much better than dealing with litter. My apartment does not smell at all anymore - even if he goes in the toilet while I'm not there, and I don't get a chance to flush it for him until I get home from classes, the water hides all smell of his waste so not even the bathroom smells even if there's his waste sitting there unflushed in the toilet. This is a huge difference from when we used litter, and he wouldn't bury it all the way, and it would smell up the entire bathroom. So basically what I'm trying to say is - toilet training is SO worth it, and I very much recommend this kit to help you get there.",cats,2
"This box is a nice sturdy plastic, but unfortunately I have found that it is not odor-free. I live in a 540 sq ft studio in Manhattan with one cat, and you can smell what's in the box as soon as you walk into the apartment.

If anyone wants to buy this box from me, I've only had it about a month and would be happy to re-sell. (Based on the reviews, it does seem to work for some folks.)",cats,2
Overall a great product. The only problems I've encountered so far are:-The hose nozzle is too big and not flexible enough.

"My son received this as a Christmas gift, and the past 5 months have been very enjoyable. Guests think it's pretty cool, and our cat doesn't stand a chance against this fish bowl. It's much sturdier than it looks, just make sure to have a wall anchor as water is heavy of course. It's a little awkward to change out the water, but we just add some fresh and siphon out some of the old. Seems to be less stressful for the little guys (my son and the fish).I have never seen a Betta jump, but maybe they do.

"I really disliked cleaning the litter box. I would always put it off too long and then felt horrible for my kitty. This litter box makes it so much easier, and I empty the litter a whole lot more now than I used to.Giving the box a roll, tap and then back over is all it takes...then dump the waste and you are done.I did have one day when the lock on the front of the box came undone and the litter started to come out the side when I rolled it over. Not a fun mess, so I now do a quick check and make sure all of the locks to keep the top on are secure before I roll and tap.I love that I don't have to buy liners for the cat box any more. I love that it takes less than a minute to clean it. I love that I don't have to feel guilty because I put the job off for so long. I'm certain my kitty is happy about that, too.I think who ever thought of this is a genius.If you really hate cleaning the litter box...this is definitely for you!",cats,2

Yes he is big, yes he is active, but in no way would i describe him as an excessive puller on the leash. i got the harness because he really has a hard time going the same direction i do, meaning he will move to the right while Im trying to go left. so, the harness really did help him gently turn with me. plus its better having any pressure in the front and not on his neck.he is in basic dog obedience and the instructor liked the easy walk harness but had actually recommended another one, should have listened.i liked that the D ring was in the front of the chest and not the back, like a husky pulling a sled.either way, if they decide to make more durable harnesses and i will consider buying another.",dogs,3
"This product is great! We have tried several other collars for our Maltese to try and control his constant barking at everything from people, the doorbell, other dogs and even leaves blowing in the yard. We have him wear it at night, he does not wear it 24/7, dogs should be able to bark since it's their natural instinct. He barks once, gets a whif, and he's done! It's awesome!!",dogs,3
"One of my coworkers gave me a couple of these when I first rescued my kitten. She loves them! They bounce around in unpredictable ways, almost appearing to be alive somehow!Her favorite, which she's named ""Blue Springstein,"" must have gotten knocked under the stove or something, so I'm ordering another pack to replace him.Highly recommended!",cats,2

"I had this feeder for 10 years before it fell to the floor and shattered. The spring load broke first, within the first year. I had to reset the unit manually (move the ring and red rigger by hand). I had battery issues throughout the life of the unit but I found if I tested the unit several days before going away, I could make sure it worked. By year 4, the unit would skip days, for example, the cat never got to eat meal 2 because the door moved past 2 to meal 3. Occasionally, other days would skip. It got the the point that I had to ask someone to check on the unit every 3 days to make sure the cat was fed. It was impossible to have total comfort that my sweet cat was okay.I only fed female cats using this device (the largest cat was 12 lbs). I read in the other reviews about the cats pushing open the next day. While my cats did this occasionally, it didn't happen every time I used it. I think a 16 pound cat or larger would make this device a play thing.Now that my unit is broken, I am trying a different brand. If that does work, I will come back to this unit.",cats,2
"This is the 2nd one I have ordered. The first one last for more than 6 months! It is a great toy for my dog. she loves it...brings it to me when I get home. Good quality and pet loves it.I did noticed a difference in material for this second one. It seems smoother and smaller. I ordered a large like the first one but this one seems and feels smaller. That is the only down fall.Overall, good product.",dogs,3
"This item is very durable, but a little difficult to adjust properly for the size of the dog food. My dog loves puzzle-type toys and flips this one all over the house until all the food is gone and eaten.

"My little poodle loves to be next to ""Mommy"" and she loves this carrier, me too. I can take her with me on hikes or anywhere pets are allowed.

We love it!",dogs,3

We have two Australian Cattle Dogs. It took them about 15 seconds to figure out how to get the treats out of the toys. The good thing is that the process of getting the treats is a long one so it still takes time to get the treats out. I think that if the two dogs weren't so food motivated they would get bored very quickly with these.Pros,dogs,3
"This product is plagued by breakdowns. The collar has broken 3 times in the first 6 months. First, the probes in the collar fell off. New collar, $56.00, long prongs, $9.95, overnight shipping, $15.00. Then our dog pulled the reciever off of the collar. New collar, $56.00, long prongs, $9.95, overnight shipping, $15.00. Then the cap on the battery came off. New cap, $9.95, new battery, $8.95, $15.95 for overnight shipping. If you have a long haired dog like I do, you have to buy the longer probes extra every time you replace the collar. The product was expensive enough to begin with without paying an extra $40-$50 dollars every time you turn around. I would try a different manufacturer next time, maybe invisa-fence. Even if it is more expensive up front, it would probably be cheaper in the long run.",dogs,3
My cats absolutely love this toy! They just cannot get enough of it! I keep it folded up in one of my bookcases and they sit at the base of it and cry at me begging for me to get the toy down so they can play. It's great for wearing down kittens so they'll go to sleep at night. I turn on a one hour show and watch tv while I bounce it all over the living room while they chase it. When my program is done=I have worn out kitties! Best toy ever!!!,cats,2

"I bought this Gentle Leader for my Saint Bernard that I rescued in March. He has never had prior training and was always pulling on the leash! Obviously, because he's such a big dog, his pulling habbits had to stop. My trainer recommended a Gentle Leader, so I checked Amazon.com, of course, and they had exactly what I needed. This thing is definitely an attitude adjuster! When he's wearing the Gentle Leader, he tends to stick closer to me, and when he does decide to pull, he's quickly stopped by the Gentle Leader pulling him back to me.This thing is amazing! I recommend it to ANYONE with ANY pulling problem with their dog.",dogs,3
"I purchased this item for a English Bull Terrier runt puppy who was struggling to stay alive and not gaining weight.

It worked for us and I was so glad to have found it.",dogs,3

"I read the reviews on here before I purchased the product and was hesitant but decided to order anyway because of a lack of alternatives.My cat was crying incessantly for me to feed him periodically through the day starting at between 3-4AM. This was taking a toll on both myself and my husband. Due to weight, I had to control portions so I could not just leave out an unlimited supply of food.I have been extremely pleased with the product. To dispute a few of the complaints I read from other users, my husband programmed the timer and he said it was not difficult if you followed the directions. Also, both the hopper and the lid have a locking mechanism to keep kitties from knocking it over and releasing the food.I no longer have to listen to my cat cry and beg for food all day. He no longer runs to the bathroom (where is food is) everytime I start in that direction. He knows the food comes from the feeder now and not from me.Bottom line, I highly recommend this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",cats,2
Have noticed a marked improvement in my 16 year old Siamese's ability to easily reach his feeding shelf (out of the dog's reach). Recommend this product!,cats,2

"I bought this for my 6 months old mastiff puppy I had gotten one of the adjustable ones with the plastic knobs. It took her only a couple minutes to turn that one over and chew on the knobs. I sent that one back and kept looking for on with ""no chewable parts"". This one works fine. It is also cheaper than many of the ones that I found.",dogs,3
"I agree with a previous reviewer that this toy is best for a medium-sized dog. The goose is a little plump so it's harder for a smaller dog to squeak it. I have a medium-sized dog and his specialty is ripping the squeaker and stuffing out of toys. I continue to purchase the AKC toys because they are more realistic looking (rather than crazy, brightly colored toys). If you're dog is a ""killer"" these AKC toys are very easy to tear apart, but luckily they're cute and fairly cheap so I don't mind. If your dog is the opposite and never tears squeakers out then this toy is even better.",dogs,3
"My biggest complaint is it's instability. No matter how I seat belt it in, it wobbles. I think that might be what turned off my dog. He tried to perch his feet on the edge by the window, and it tumbled forward. He knocked his head on the window only to have the car seat fall forward against the dash. Since then he won't stayed in the seat. Too bad, since it wasn't cheap. On the flip side my cat likes it as a bed.",dogs,3
I bought this item for my cats a few years ago. I thought they would love to go in and out of it and sleep in it too. Well they both looked at it once and then ignored it!

"The cover does what it's supposed to do. It was delivered relatively quickly and was easy to install. We did air it out for a few hours, as it does have an odor.

I don't think I would spend too much more than that, only because it is, after all only a cloth cover.",dogs,3
"This is a review for both theTattle Tale Sonic Pet Training Alarmand theCatscram Electronic Cat Repellent.I have a needy cat who HAS to be on the other side of any and all closed doors at all times. If she is inside, she wants out. If she is outside, she wants in. You may think this would be cute, until you're trying to sleep inside the room with the closed door. An open door is not an option because I can't have my eight year old walk in on her step father and I in the middle of the night either. This had been going on for almost a year. I felt my sanity slipping away from me due to lack of sleep. I would regularly pass out sitting up at my desk at work, and get caught in the act! I was on the verge of giving her away (which I hated to do, but I didn't know what else I could do). Then I came to Amazon with my problem, which I do for all my product needs.I had first bought theTattle Tale Sonic Pet Training Alarmafter reading reviews and comparing prices. It worked...very well. I attached it to my door with some command strips. Any time that she pawed at my door the alarm would sound and she would stop. The problem is that it has a very loud tone that is audible to humans and would wake me up. The up side is that she would not continue to paw at the door the rest of the night, so it was a good trade off...I would only be woken up once during the night. It has 2 settings, High and Low. I only used the Low setting which seemed to be very sensitive. I can see how this would be EXTREMELY helpful for dog owners who want to keep their pooch off the couch when they are away. I plan on trying it on my counter top on the High setting to see if it keeps my sister's counter surfing kitty off (update to come).I decided I wanted better. I have to say, I was very skeptical about theCatscram Electronic Cat Repellentat first. The reviews were ok but the price was nearly double what I paid for theTattle Tale Sonic Pet Training Alarm. I decided to take the plunge anyways and I am so glad that I did! I followed the instructions when I first turning it on then set it up in front of my door frame facing across my door. I could tell it was working because my cat was sitting on my bed staring at it with her eyes dilated, which was a good sign. I set her outside my bedroom and closed the door. I went to sleep and woke up 6 hours later! Could it be?! Did I really just sleep 6 hours straight with no interruptions?! You have no idea how happy I was. Maybe there is hope for my sanity yet. The motion sensor on it is sensitive enough to sense movement in very dim lighting conditions so I can also put it inside my bedroom to keep her from trying to get out in the middle of the night and we can still get our cuddle time in.The manual for theCatscram Electronic Cat Repellentdoes mention that it may not work for white cats because their range of hearing is by nature very limited, and also older cats or some exotic breeds may not be affected by it. It works for my little calico though.So the verdict is",dogs,3
Got this item to help train my dog when he gets too excited when there are a lot of people around. worked well for the first day or two. Then I noticed that sometimes I'd press the buttons and nothing would happen. Eventually it would only work less than 50 percent of the time. I don't think I would recommend this product to anyone else unless you dont mind spending the money for something that could possibly not work for your needs.,dogs,3

Been through 2 other pouches and my pant's pocket before buying this treat pouch. This makes having those treats available at all times and not treats fall out of the pouch when bending over because of the quick closing pouch. The smaller pouch can be used for different treats or to store you clicker. It also has a key chain ring on the pouch if you prefer to keep your clicker there. A much smaller pouch is on the back side for those times when Fido does his business in public and you need a bag to clean up. Worth every penny.,dogs,3
"As for construction, it seems sturdy enough and it's unique in that it has rotating teeth. However, it does make a bit of noise which my dog did not like. Also, my dog has a medium coat- not very long, but he does have some undercoat. It seemed to me this would be better for a dog with longer hair or a thicker undercoat- it just didn't really grip the hair or get it out on my dog. Now it's just sitting in a box not being used. I much prefer the Oster undercoat rake for my dog's coat- really gets a ton more hair out than this one.",dogs,3
"My Springer spaniel ADORES this toy. It's like a security blanket to her. She usually rips off most of the tennis-ball fuzz, leaving a goofy-looking rubber football. But she LOVES this thing. We've designated it as an ""outdoor-only"" toy (because she has too many toys), and it's the first thing she grabs when she walks out the door. It's more important to her than actually going to the bathroom. She gets very sad when she can't find the toy (when she's played with the kids, or drops it to go after a rabbit, and then can't find it when she comes back). She lost one over the winter in the snow, and we (she) didn't find it until spring. She was ecstatic. She brings it to the back door and knows to drop it before she comes inside, though sometimes she tries to sneak it in.We've been through a few of these over the years, buying a new one when an old one gets lost, or when it finally bites the dust. (We foster animals, and an especially gregarious pit bull puppy helped shred one to bits - but they had a blast playing with all the smaller pieces. If they hadn't played tug-of-war, I don't think the whole ball would have come apart.)For all those who are bummed about the fuzzy stuff...that's life. The dogs love to ""skin"" what they eat or play with. The ball underneath is still perfectly fine for playing with, if a bit slobbery by the time she brings it back to you to throw again.As happy as this thing makes my dog, I'll never stop buying them.",dogs,3

"My cats love these. I had a hunch they would, because they are always taking off with the little plastic lids on juice containers. These are so simple and inexpensive, yet they provide a lot of entertainment. Both cats are 9 months old, and they play with these on their own, with each other, or with me. They play both on the carpet and on the slick kitchen floor. They drop them at my feet so that I will throw them and they retrieve them, they bat them around, they carry them upstairs and bat them around in the empty bathtub. They drop them in my shoes, boots, and purse. I find them in their water dishes. I only bought one package to begin with, because I never know for sure what they will like, but I recently found them at the pet supply and bought three more packages, because these are the new favorite toy.",cats,2

"We picked up a 6oz bag at petco at first (for like $7), but since our puppy loved them we committed to a bigger bag, and this was the best price around (amazon prime wins every time).Highly recommended for training, but remember that hotdogs are better than pretty much anything (though gross...). These treats will dry out if left unsealed for a pretty long period of time (many days, a week?), so don't take out too many at once, but even dried she still loves them.If you're on the fence, definitely get them :)",dogs,3
"I tend to do it every week. When fleas are present you can see dead fleas falling off the dog when you rinse. A combination of these things is best - not just Frontline alone. Another thing - remember that this flea is called the CAT flea. Of course it infests dogs too, but it is especially well adapted to the cat. Bottom line - control fleas on your cat(s) as well as your dog(s). Control fleas and you will control tapeworms. They are transmitted by the flea.Another thing to consider - the flea, along with mosquitos, could probably be considered to be among the most dangerous animals in the world. (Not lions and tigers and bears, Oh My!). Fleas, by transmitting bubonic plague, killed 1/3 of the people in Europe in the 1300's. They are not a joke. I have used Frontline on my two Labradors for years, but I do it a bit sporadically as needed and seasonally. From the research I have seen, Frontline is more effective than Advantage, and it seems to work well on my Labs. One disadvatage on these dogs is that they are a female (70 lbs) and a male (85 lbs), and so they are near the upper end of the weight range for this dose (45 - 88 lbs). This makes me suspect that it is not quite as effective as it would be on a dog at 43 lbs. To compensate, I tend to put it on at about 3 week intervals instead of the recommended 4 week interval. Fleas have about a three week life cyle (depending on temp), and so you need to hit them ""inside"" of this interval to prevent them laying eggs again.Cleanliness is very important in controlling fleas as sleeping areas tend to be places where larvae and feces collect, larvae feeding on the blood-rich feces that drops off of the dog. Wash bedding, shake-out beds, vacuum frequently, etc. Another thing I have found very effective is to WASH the dog(s) frequently -",dogs,3

We've been through four or five fountains during our forty years of feline companionship, and all of our cats have seemed to love drinking from the flowing water.If you happen to have a water-loving Maine Coon, he will find it much harder to splash all of the water out of this fountain as opposed to splashing it out of a simple water dish.Be sure to buy extra filters and the water jug that attaches to the back of the fountain.",cats,2

"I loved this collar when I received it. Just beautiful for my little Diva Princess Kacee. She is a 20 lb black-white and brindle Boston Terrier. I made sure to measure her neck and also measured the length of the other collars she had worn. I felt very comfortable in ordering the Lupine 3/4"" Wild Thing 9-14 Adjustable Dog Collar. It is a well made sturdy collar, however - she doesn't have much hair on the front of her neck and the way they secured the ends of the collar (I'm assuming) so it wouldn't fray makes it very hard and prickly scratching her neck and causing it to turn red. Also lining it up with the other collars I had for her it I found it was shorter. It IS very stiff! So...I went to my handy dandy sewing machine and took out the adjustment part of the collar and did a zigzag stitch across the prickly ends so it was softer. Then I left out the adjustment part and resewed the clasp onto the collar. I also rolled the collar between my hand and the table (for a while) to soften it up. It is softer and fits her perfectly. Now I know I could have returned the collar, but I really loved the print and couldn't find anything up here that I liked. So....this is a well made collar and for the dogs who have lots of hair on the front of their necks I'm sure it would be ok. If your dogs neck measurement is on the hairy edge - I would order the next size up. Also understand the collar is ""stiff"". Possibly after wearing for awhile it will soften up. The clasp is nice and sturdy also....and the print is lovely.",dogs,3

"This may be a great product for some, but it didn't work for us. I put the collar on my barks-a-lot 1 year old puppy and within minutes he barked -- the collar prayed the citronella and the dog was confused, he barked at the mist and collar went off again. This continued, followed by much coughing and gagging. At the time, I was dealing with HORRIBLE morning sickness coupled with allergies and found that after the citronella was sprayed all over the house, I was running for the bathroom getting sick from the smell. Later that afternoon, I went to pet my puppy as he was being a good boy. I scratched the side of his neck under his ear (favorite spot) and thought it should be far enough away from the sensors but that still triggered the collar again and I got sprayed in the face. After that I spent the rest of the day sick in bed :( Love that morning sickness! Later in the evening, the puppy got down on his favorite rug, rolled around and the collar went off, he got up and shook after a nap flopping his hears and the collar went off. After that, the puppy scratched his ear with his hind foot and the collar went off again. That night... mommy took his collar off -- forever. The puppy was happy and mommy felt better :)Food for thought. Our dog trainer was very concerned that we had chosen a ""bark collar."" She says it's better to just have a remote operated training collar that you control. You want your dog to give at least one warning bark in case there is something wrong (intruder/danger). After all there is a reason dogs bark, to communicate. With a remote operated collar, you can control the EXCESSIVE barking. I'm buying one of those remote shock collars now. Tried one on myself, not much more than a static shock you get from your clothes in the winter.",dogs,3
"I purchased this item to use for a Siberian Husky puppy and was very disappointed when it arrived. The sides which show a dog resting its head on are barely able to hold up my hand. With only the slightest pressure the sides cave in and fold over which defeats the purpose. The bottom is VERY thin and can be pinched between two fingers. Your pet might as well be laying on the carpet. The ""sherpa"" cover is also extremely thin and not very soft. It is more like a car buffing material. Lastly the item I received was very dirty on the foam bottom so it was probably returned from previous purchaser. If you love or even care for your pet even a little do not buy this so called bed!",dogs,3
"These things are awesome. Period. I started replacing one of my floss filters with this medium per one of the girls at my local pet store, trying to remove tannins from my driftwood. This does so much more, and is super efficient. For tank critters with super clean water requirements, these are a must. Only wish they weren't so expensive.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I bought this cage second hand and it has been great for our lop eared bunny. He is more of a free roaming bunny, so the cage size is adequate for him to use as a resting and sleeping place at night. It houses a big litter box and food bowl comfortably. He has enough room to lounge. Clean up would be easier if there is an opening at the top since the front door is smaller. Would recommend a bigger cage if your bunny is always in the cage.",small animals,5
"I have had Littermaid electric litterboxes for 8 years now (I have 4 cats,) one, still an original and still functioning. This one, however, is the worst. It is incredibly noisy, the metal tines don't pick up the litter, leaving little clumps everywhere, and the clumps end up behind the tines frequently. It also gets stuck on relatively small lumps. It also doesn't turn itself back on in the case of a power outage. (Found that out one smelly day.) Save money, buy the older model- mega- plastic tines and quieter!",cats,2
"I've been using these for all of our training and so far he hasn't gotten bored with them. He eagerly awaits each one.

For me, the fact that I read that they are made and sourced in the USA makes them a good treat option.",dogs,3

"We have a male black lab that we absolutely love, but he isn't the most obedient dog ever. He is probably the hardest dog to walk because he is CONSTANTLY pulling. After some research I decided to purchase this one, and it INSTANTLY DID WONDERS!! He was a little unsure about having something around him at first, but he did just fine after a few minutes. Believe it or not, we had slack in the leash for almost all of the walk. This is made our daily walks A LOT more enjoyable for EVERYONE. A+++++++!!!",dogs,3

The problem is, it's not and there's nothing on the toy that clips on to the ""Da Bird"" pole in order for it to work with that toy.My cat still likes this toy, throws it in the air and really has a good time with it but don't buy this if you want to use it with your Da Bird cat toy.",cats,2

"I'm very happy with the indoor/outdoor plastic pet pen. I have a little three-pound puppy and this contains her very well, while getting her outside in the nice weather. Gives me a break from watching her every minute too. She will only get to be about twice as big as now so I expect I'll be using the pen for quite some time. I ordered two more panels to give her a bit more room to play in. The quality is good, and it is lightweight and easy to move around. Also, super easy to put together. Thanks for a great product.",dogs,3
"We adopted two year and a half old dogs from our local Humane Society who had not had much time, attention or training. Walking them on leashes with a standard collar was a nightmare- pulling and lunging and they were nearly impossible for me to control them separately, much less together. Our trainer recommended this type of collar and I was able to loose-leash walk both of them together with one hand the first trip out with very minor tugs to keep them in check. The collar is tough for me to open and close the recommended way but I'd rather that than too easy. These collars are a must-have for us and our girls are happy they can get out more and explore the world.",dogs,3
"I would say that the dog loves this Frisbee. This is the third one I have used over the last nine years.The previous two were lost due to owners failure to follow correct maintenance procedures on the thrower mechanism, meaning my arm.The only thing that I can say that is negative is that the 'glow' doesn't last as long as the previous ones.With that said the 'bone' emblem on the top makes it much easier to dogs to pick the Frisbee up; the Frisbee flies really well andglows.As I said my Black Sheppard loves the thing.Timahh",dogs,3

"We have had problems with other litters with it being tracked around the house. This product doesn't seem to get caught in our cats paws. The smell of the litter is unique, it has a sweet smell. It smells sweet but you have a wad of poop messes with your senses. Our cats transitioned to the new litter without a problem. It clumps and holds well while sifting out the unused portioned. Unlike other litters when you sift the clump, some of the contaminated litter falls back into the box. The Worlds Best Cat Litter lives up to its name.",cats,2
"Many years ago I had a reef tank. Now I've been working on a freshwater planted aquarium and it is just as challenging, although thankfully a little cheaper. I can't afford all the real fancy stuff so I add Flourish twice a week and it seems to help. I figure the plants need the nutrients. I also stay away from activated charcoal because it just pulls it all back out. Be careful though for the occasional algae blooms. I still get them and the only solutions seem yo be to be very careful on home much light you use, and don't overfeed!",fish aquatic pets,4
"Maybe my expectations were too high, but based on the reviews I thought it would strap in securely and have some kind of harness attachment mechanism (even just a loop would have worked) but it did neither.The only way it is secured in place is with the seat belt crossing one corner of the back part. All it takes is a sudden stop at 25 mph to tilt and cause my dog to fall off the seat. It works fine as a regular booster seat, but provides no safety for my 12 lbs. min pin mix. Plus he doesn't even like sitting in it, and hops out and climbs into my lap as soon as we start moving (whether it's in the front or back seat).So now it's just taking up room in the back seat of my car, until we've got enough room for it in the can on trash day. It's too bad, because I really need a safe, secure car seat for my dog.Why two stars? Because it seems well constructed (though poorly designed) so I would have felt bad about giving them less.",dogs,3

"We've been using the Litter Locker for about 3 years and have never had a complaint. In fact we thought of it as a God-send! When our local Petco stopped carrying the refills, (although they still sell the Litter Locker unit...go figure), we started looking on-line.The first place we saw was Amazon, my favorite place to shop! I've used several of their sellers before without any problem, so I wasn't the least bit apprehensive about buying from one of them.We placed the order on a Sunday and in less than a week we had them, and at half the price that we would have spent at Petco!I'm not sure what the ""plus"" is and it doesn't seem to be addressed anywhere on the labeling, but I was concerned it might be a size issue and wouldn't fit our unit. As it turns out, it fits perfectly and we are once again happily shrink wrapping our kitty's ""buried treasures"".",cats,2

Owing to their push-face structure, Pugs have impossibly crooked little nubs of teeth crowded into their small mouths. I tossed this Ball into the floor, and within 5 minutes, Mildred, who's 12, had the treat out of the ball. The treat alone seems like a choking hazard to me, and we are not able to use this item for any purpose. I loved the design, but won't be buying it again b/c the design does not serve the purpose.",dogs,3

Dogs don't really have a sense of size- they're as happy with a small bite as a much larger treat! And you don't want you're dog to be too busy chewing when you want to keep his/her attention and repeat a behavior. These treats are just the right size!",dogs,3
"I saw this in a magazine. I wanted a solution because my kitten used to play with water and make it messy. He used to splash water with his paw and the whole floor would be wet. So, I tried this pet fountain. My kitten and dogs love this. I also got the 50 oz attachment also. So now, they have fresh water all the time. My dogs are happy because they don't have carry their empty bowl out to me when they were thirsty. It gets noisy when it needs refilling. I have had it for about 2 weeks now. Maybe it is just a habit from cleaning pet water and food dishes, but I do clean it when I need to add fresh water. Now I only need to give the pets' fresh water every 1 1/2 to 2 days instead of twice or three times a day. Also, I don't have to worry about whether I have filled it up. When it needs refilling, I usually wash it and fill it and the 50oz attachment and it is good for almost 2 days.Oh yes, the kitten doesn't make it messy now.",birds,0

"FYI if you don't already know, these are only everlasting when accompanied by the Everlasting Treat Ball, which is a sturdy rubber ball toy you jam these into.I originally bought the ball and these treats (size small) for my mini dachshund who gets into mischief when I'm not home. She's VERY food-oriented so trying to get the treat out of the ball by licking it and scraping with her front teeth originally kept her occupied for almost a week during the days (we would put it up when we're home to play with her) with the bonus of cleaning her teeth really well. However, she has figured out how to pry the treat out of the ball after some licking, so it only lasts about a day or two now. Amazon has them for cheap so we still buy them, but we only give them to her when we'll be gone for longer than just an hour or two so we don't have to buy a new two-pack every week.",dogs,3

Now we have it set on 1 and have had her get the sound 2 times is all since and both times was chasing another dog out of the yard. She heard the beep and immediatly turned around and came away from the flags. Chevy is either a very smart dog or this product works great, maybe both.

I don't hate cleaning the cat litter anymore and can do it every day without it being a big deal. I hated scooping the poop with a scoup-shovel, and I also didn't like throwing away tons of cat litter every day with the non-sifting liners. These sifting pan liners are the perfect solution. You start by putting all 10 liners in the pan then wrapping the included rubber band around the side. When it is time to clean the litter just pick up the sides that aren't anywhere near the gross stuff, gather them together, shake a little so the clean litter comes out, then stick it all in a plastic grocery bag to put in the outside garbage.",cats,2

And I've tried harnesses, head harnesses, slip collars, clicking buttons, treats, walking the opposite direction when she yanks, stopping and making her sit everytime she pulls, nothing worked. But this harness is really amazing, it does it for you, when she pulls it turns her around, so she's pulling on herself and not you, works great I recommend this to anyone!",dogs,3

She can &#34;nest&#34; in it and still have plenty of room to stretch if she wants to. She's a dark brown color (like a chocolate lab) and the khaki has been a great shade in hiding her dog hair from the average eye, and it's neutral enough to fit in with the decor without looking ugly. I haven't tried washing it yet so I can't review how well that will work, but I'm sure it will be fine. The best thing is that my husband and I don't have to kick her out of our bed at night anymore--she leaves willingly to go sleep in her new bed!",dogs,3

I have had the ScoopFree for about a year and was really satisfied with the product until I needed to contact their website for problems with squeaky noise whenever the rake moved and needing a new purple lid when I dropped mine and one of the tabs broke off.

The squeaky noise attracts my cat and she is always trying to bat it around when it is working. I can't keep her from messing with it so don't expect it to work much longer.Update,cats,2

"Finally broke down and spent the &#34;big bucks&#34; to get a top quality shock collar and I can report that it was a great investment. The reach is GREAT, the variations available perfect. With proper training, you won't even be using the shock part of the collar after about a week. Once your dog &#34;gets&#34; it, you can use the beeper and get the dogs attention like right now. And it's nice insurance if your dog will chase things. We have rabbits, foxes, coyotes, and even bobcats around here (Arizona) even though its suburbs. I walk my dog EARLY in the morning, still dark, and let her off the leash on some trails, and on the local golf course. If she sees rabbits, no problems, but if she sees a coyote, the race is on.

Also, at the time my kittens (I have two) were only 12 weeks old, so I was looking for a collar that would adjust with their growth. I'm happy to report that this collar (I ordered two, in different colors) has been great. Even the vet noticed the collar and remarked how neat it is. The collar looks really sharp and has a nice sized metal loop for hanging an ID tag, etc. Both kittens took to this collar just fine (it was their first collar) and I have been able to let the collar out a bit as they've grown. I also like the fact that there's no ""extra collar"" hanging out past the buckle -- the collar just forms a big loop around the kitty's neck. The only issue I've had is one of the collars is a bit hard to adjust -- but overall I've been very pleased.",cats,2

The only thing that would make this thing perfect would be to make it a little taller as it doesn't leave the water very deep however I will probably put mine on something to make it higher and hopefully that will help.",fish aquatic pets,4
"When we brought Noelle home she got sick and we had a mess to clean. This was so easy to wash and it came out just as if it was brand new. It is something our baby loves. It is so cute to watch. She has a bed on it and she actually sleeps on this and under the bed we have on top of it. So if you wonder if you should get it don't hesitate to get it because it is as wonderful as it looks and was told. I will be getting another one soon as a backup while washing this one. So Noelle if she could speak would say thanks I love it.Love,Paulagene and Noelle",dogs,3

I can't say much about the freshness of my dog's kibble, because I haven't had it too long, but it's really easy to just pour the food in, seal it up, and take out what I need from the top. I really like the slim design, and it held my 37 lb Blue Buffalo perfectly. Very satisfied.",cats,2

"I have two 16 year old cats, and I have tried various brands of cat vitamins but of course they always would recoil or at least be indifferent to the smell (even the vites infused with meat essences) so I'd always have to blend them in with their food until I tried the ActiPet brand. It is hard to believe that they are actually vitamins because my cats beg for them like they are kitty treats when I pick up the bottle!! So I give them their vites for dessert after mealtime! And for the record, both of them are happy, healthy and active for their ages, still running around and playing with each other, and one of them even runs on my treadmill!",cats,2

"I have had cats for 30+ years, and have tried all sorts of litter boxes including Booda domes, etc.This is the best litter box to date.It is super easy to empty, and minimizes the dust and odor you would typically stir up if you were scooping the litter.I can empty my litter box every day and only have to wash my hands afterwards, not change my entire set of clothes.The smell of cat urine has been reduced in the home, because I can easily empty the box more frequently.It works well with the Arm&Hammer; Suoer Scoop litter, but you may have to tap the bottom of the litter box to dislodge some clumps from the bottom of the box. This has not been a problem.I would highly recommend this, especially the large version if you have 2 or more cats. It is the best box on the market.",cats,2
"Going from a standard bed to a very tall Tempurpedic bed created a height problem for our four dogs. We had a three step contraption that did OK before, but wasn't even close for the new bed. The Solvit PupSTEP Plus did exactly that -- solved the ""problem"" for our pups. They took to the steps as soon as I opened the box.....even the smallest -- a 17# cockapoo.There was no assembly required, other than sticking the carpet-like material on each step. The steps are very sturdy and very steady. What a great find and value.....and where else? Amazon! I would recommend without question.",dogs,3

I find myself having to actually get in the back seat and push the seatbelt latch out every single time -- very annoying.

"I own six cats and never have found a scratching post that either lasted a week or two, or that drew no interest from my cats. Within an hour of setting up the SmartCat Post, a couple of my cats were stretched out fully scratching away. Clawing at furniture stopped immediately, and I had tried so many sprays and sticky strips to make them stop ruining my furniture. I realize cats are very opinionated, and yours might totally ignore the SmartCat Post. I can only share my experience that my cats love it, my furniture destruction problem is solved, and the post is worth it's rather expensive cost.",cats,2

On the side for any whom might read this hoping for a bit of info should their pets have this problem... Don't forget to treat your home as well as your pets. I use a carpet powder by Hartz. If you decide to use the powder as I did (my ranch house is all carpeted minus the bathrooms and kitchen, it took me 4 to treat my whole house) be sure to pick up a few of these bottles, another broom, paint mask, and have your pets placed in a room with a door that has been treated at least 24 hours. This stuff is very thick and will take at least an hour to completely settle once you have swept the powder into your carpet the directions tell you to let it stay for at least an hour but recommend 24 hours before vacuuming. Remember to wipe down all surfaces like tables after vacuuming.",cats,2
"I wanted to update this review since she's had the toy for about two months now. This is STILL my lab/border collie mix's favorite toy! When she is in an excitable mood, she loves to tear the squirrels out of the log. When she's in a quieter, herding mood, she enjoys moving the squirrels into new piles in the apartment (I think it's her collie herding instinct). Sometimes I walk out of the bathroom and there is a squirrel army waiting for me outside the door!I thought she would rip apart these squirrels and we would need to replace them, but she has an odd affection for them and doesn't try to bite them apart. She even takes them into her crate to sleep with.Original review",dogs,3

"I have tons and tons of toys for my cats but they inevitably gets sick of the toy. But no matter how many times they play with Da Bird, they never get sick of this toy. I bought this toy based on the many many good reviews it got. And my cat loves it!After playing with kitty for a couple of minutes, I can see the appeal. First, the feather flutters when it's up in the air. Second, when I put it in front of a fan, the feather spins and it actually sounds like a bird's flapping wings, plus, it moves with the wind so my cat will start jumping for it. Third, my cat never gets sick of it. In fact, she will come by, charm you with her purring whenver she wants to play with it. She knows which drawer we keep it and she knows how to ask for it.This is the first toy that she has REPEATEDLY requested to play. I don't think she's ever tried requesting for another toy.The one con is that it's not the most durable toy - partially because it's not constructed too well and probably because my cat tears it to shreds whenever she gets her hand on it. So we are constantly replacing the feathers and sometimes even the stick if she breaks the string too many times. Basically, you will need to replace it a lot if your cat loves it as much as mine does.",cats,2

"Repetetion is an excellent way to teach a parrot - IF there is also a visual, taste or sound stimulus with the word or phrase. Just hearing a word repeated over and over again begins to teach the bird - but what does the word mean? What is a cookie without the visual and taste stimulus?As instructed,I put my CD player on repeat to play a single track again and again. After five minutes the parrot was upset and started repeating, ""NO!"" Now when he hears the beginning of that song he whistles and says ""NO!"" African Grays are smart and blind repetetion wasn't the best way. Now I occasionally play the CD through and let him decide what he wants to repeat. One problem with the CD - all the audio tracks were not recorded at the same level and some tend to be much louder than other tracks.Would I buy it again - probably not.",dogs,3

"My beagle, who has full access to our fenced in backyard, nearly lost her freedom because she would incessantly bark at any person or dog within earshot.I was timid about getting one of these, but after the initial shock she got from the first time we put it on, she never barked again. I knew she would be startled, so I stayed near her to calm her down quickly after she got shocked for the first time. At this point (over a year later) we probably could take the batteries out because she knows not to bark when it's on.The collar length was more than we needed, but we were able to tighten it just fine, and I trimmed the end and hit it with a lighter so that it wouldn't fray. After all this time, she hasn't managed to break it. It shows signs of wear, but it remains structurally sound. I check it every once in a while by rubbing the contacts across the counter to hear the beep to confirm the batteries are still working, and so far they haven't died.",dogs,3

Nope. This thing lasted about 6 months, and now won't retract. I tried to take it apart to fix it, but even that isn't cooperating with me. For the money these things cost, you'd expect it to last a bit longer. Do yourself a favor and get the store brand--that way, if it only lasts a few months (which it probably won't--it'll probably last years) you won't have lost buckets of cash on it.",cats,2

OK we are completely surprised about this one. But our dog loves this thing and it is in the same condition as day 1 after 2 months or so of daily use. All of the chipmunks squeak and because they are small our dog can't get enough leverage to tear them apart. 2 bonus things about this - you can hold a chipmunk from inside and pretend like it's peaking in and out at your dog. When your dog attacks squeak the chipmunk like it's crazy. Lot's of fun. Also you can just stick your hand in the stump and wear it like a boxing glove and push your dog away while he tried to get it from you. A+++ considering the price. We gave similar versions of this toy to our friends' dogs and they all report the positive reviews.,dogs,3

"I have two Labradors which are known for their 'double coat'. Long hair on the surface and a down undercoat.The undercoat was the issue. We had to vacuum the entire house every day. Every time they would stand up and do their customary shake you could see a nice cloud of super short hair leave their bodies. I tried every 'reasonably priced' product out there eventually spending rougly $50 on garbage.I could never pull the trigger on the Furminator due to the price. $60 at Petco and $30 on Amazon. Knowing that if it did not work, I would not take the time to return the product by mail and refusing to pay the $60 price tag at Petco I continued vacuuming on a daily basis. I got the Petco manager to honor the Amazon price and purchsed the Furminator knowing that I could easily return the product if I was not satisfied. It was incredible!!! My dogs loved it. Every stroke pulled out the loose undercoat by the fistfull. It was a hot summer and you could see the relief in my dogs' eyes. Best of all I vacuum twice a week. Word of advice, be gentle, it is very sharp and will cut the longer hairs if you are too rough.",cats,2

"I have two small dogs (about 13 pounds) and every night about 3am one of them runs outside to bark at the rats, cats, possums, or whatever is in my fruit trees. So of course, the second dog can't be left behind and starts barking as well. Every night. I lock them in, but then one of them just whines. Or pees. I thought about using the ultrasonic birdcage until I read that it punishes the dog that doesn't bark, and I don't believe in shock collars. I don't know what took me so long to try this spray collar. It is absolutely brilliant. Worked the very first night. Has worked ever since. I just put it on the alpha dog and it is a miracle. No more night time barking! Now if only I could get the birds outside my window to stop chirping so loudly at 5 am...The spray box on the collar is a little bit bulky for a small dog, but she seems to be OK with it.

"I bought this car booster seat while I was preparing to bring home my puggle puppy on the recommendation of a friend who also has a puggle. I have another dog who happily rides in the back of my Jeep but I was nervous about putting a tiny puppy back there with her, especially on long trips. So the Outward Hound Booster Seat seemed like the perfect solution.And for the most part, it has been. It securely attaches to either the front passenger seat or the back seat and it's fully adjustable so I can put my seat cover or a towel underneath it to protect my leather seats. The clip is secure, adjustable, and easy to use, all I had to do was buy a harness and my dog was ready to go. It's kept my puppy secure and happy--she is now 15 lbs and 5 months old and she can curl up to sleep or sit up and watch the world go by our car as we drive around. She had a little problem with getting tangled in the strap but she quickly figured out how to move around to avoid that. Now if she gets tangled she is almost always able to right herself without me having to unclip her.She got carsick for a while, and the seat was very easy to clean. The mesh on the sides presented a bit of a containment problem, but I just draped a towel over the sides and it made cleanup a snap. Fortunately she is over her carsickness! The pockets on the sides and zipper pockets on the front are great for storing extra toys, treats, or even holding my keys.The ONLY problem I have with this seat is the air cushion. Fully inflated it's great and very sturdy, and it was the perfect height when she was tiny. And it's still an acceptable height now, though it takes a bit more maneuvering to get her into the seat at times. However, there is no way to deflate the cushion partway and have it remain a stable surface for Fiona to sit/lay on. I wish the cushion had 2 or maybe even 3 separate chambers that could be inflated or deflated as needed as a puppy grows into an adult. That way the height could be lowered when needed without compromising the stability of the seat. As it stands I am going to fold up some towels and put them in the space where the air cushion goes to provide some boost but not leave her riding too high.",dogs,3
"I bought the blue model for my Maine Coon Cat, and found it does remove a lot of hair, but the cat for some reason HATES it. Oddly it removes tons of hair even when my cat is not shedding. Typically she will jump up on the toilet seat so I can groom her with a slicker brush. She typically purrs to show her appreciation. However, with the Furminator, the cat acts as though I am trying to mutilate her. Whenever she sees me pick up the Furminator, She shoots straight out of the bathroom and under the bed. So yesterday I took the Furminator to my office and looked at the edge with the microscope. It looks to be basically a cutting edge 40mm long (about 1 and 1/2 inch) like a single edged razor blade, but rather crudely sharpened, with 41 comb-like pointed steel projections, each 3mm long (as measured from the razor edge out to the point) The projections make it impossible for the sharp edges to cut anything but hair,not even the most delicate fold of skin, as the distance between projection points is less than a millimeter. The 41 little cutting edges between the points are actually almost ""V"" shaped, like devices used to cut string. Years ago I carried a device called a Trim Comb when I traveled overseas to give myself haircuts. It was a razor blade in a plastic clam-shell holder with plastic comb-like projections and worked well for keeping my hair at one even length. Furminator seems similar, but with more and shorter teeth, and all milled out of a single block of steel. This device looks to me obviously for CUTTING hair, and, I suspect, has little to do with shedding, except,I suppose, that SHORT hair shed around your house is less obvious than LONG hair shed around your house. I suppose it is possible that, not being as sharp as a razor blade, the Furminator rips some hair out by the root, which may account for my cat's bad reaction, though I think it more likely that the cat realizes she is being given a HAIRCUT instead of being BRUSHED, and she HATES haircuts. Dogs may be more forgiving, but I can't recommend Furminator for cats, if for no other reason than they really don't like it.",cats,2

Even without heating it, they still sit on them, snuggle with them, and our 8-month-old kitten tears around and carries it with him. They are also very washable - I threw one in a small wash cycle and let it air dry and it came out like new. (Just remember to remove the buckwheat pouch before washing.) I understand cats have different tastes, so it depends on the cat, but I've been really happy with these warming pads.",cats,2

The dogs she went after had the head collar on and the woman kindly told me about it. She said it would ""change my life"". So I went and bought it. I carefully fit it and tried it out. OMG! Now my 11 year daughter can walk her, which she couldn't before. It has made an instant change. I am now using it to stop her from barking at every dog that walks by and from jumping on visitors. This is a miracle! And I truly don't think it is causing her any anxiety or problems. It is as if the ""code"" has been broken. That she finally understands what I want and don't want.",dogs,3

"My 11-year-old cat, who has tried plenty of other 'nip over the years, totally agrees. These flowers/buds contain more scent and flavor than any other part of the plant, particularly leaves. Since many reports suggest that cats sense catnip in their mouths, these pleasure centers must get an incredible report from Yeowww! catnip flowers. Even my comparatively limited ability to smell quickly tells me that this sweet and aromatic herb tops the list (including a catnip bud competitor). The results beat any others I have seen in more than 40 years of cats and the felines respond in kind, remembering the experience days later (and probably much longer).I'm sorry for the person who thought he was buying four--or ""only"" two--pounds of catnip, although the website now clearly says you are buying a .3-ounce bag, enough for at least two very happy experiences with my big cat. You could even argue that it's expensive, but my cat pays me back many times over so cost doesn't count much for me.By the way, as I write this on Apr. 30, 2011, only eight more bags of these flowers are currently available from the supplier with free shipping on Amazon (usually, Amazon includes the notation ""(more on the way)"" if there will be resupplies).

"I was hesitant when I ordered this cage with the negative reviews saying they continued receiving a damaged product. With my Amazon Prime account I was able to get the steal on Overnight shipping in hopes that the express delivery would negate any shipping damages. Sure enough, the next evening UPS delivered this 75 pound package to my front door. I opened the box to check the contents. The packing wasn't the best, but it definitely wasn't the worst! All parts were clean and free of dents or dings. One screw had fallen out, but I was able to find it and replace it immediately.The cage is sturdy and well designed. The playtop is a great addition and the conures enjoy spending time on top of the toy hanger. The cage is secure enough that my smartest Sun Conure can not escape, and is roomy enough that when one of the birds is having a bad day, there is plenty of room to give him his space.The food bowls included clean easily and are fantastic as far as being sterile for the birds.

"We adopted an untrained 1.5yo golden retriever a month ago. The material is sturdy and wide enough for our Audi A4 back seat. However, yes, the seat belt holes are large and dirt will sip thorugh, we duct taped it. And what you read about leather seat is correct, it does slip and I periodically adjust the anchors and the headrest straps (they get pulled by the weight of the dog). It may not cover your seat perfectly but it does the job in preventing most dirt and gravel onto your seat and it's well water proofed even after swimming. Doesn't seem to trap smell either. Our dog doesn't seem to want to chew it so it should last a while and it's worth the price.",dogs,3

"My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater. He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat. His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea. The boy has expensive taste - lol.That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints. I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up. I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide hisNutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables(I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues). Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free. My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible. Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin. The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed. BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits. It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health. So, it has good stuff in it. It's also made in the USA. After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day. For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary. For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day. Each package has about 23 treats in it. If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world. Each treat is square and has a moist look to it. It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either. Just...interesting. But the best part is he LOVES them. His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it. He looks forward to it every day.Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food. He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves. He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter) But these Zuke treats? Heck yeah! Never a problem. Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.",dogs,3

"My dog is a rescue and had really bad teeth so many of them had to be pulled. But even with just a few, she LOVES to gnaw on this. I love how focused she is when she get her nylabone... because she just really gets into scraping her teeth against it.I have bought several different nylabone flavors/types but she always seems to prefer the original and chicken flavor.I also follow the directions and steep them in chicken broth for a while so not sure it that flavor penetrates inside because I rinse it off after steeping.She seems to lose interest in them after gnawing off the nubs on one side... so they don't last too long. In less than a year, she has gone through 8 of them. I wish they were less expensive. I have found that ordering directly from this vendor (entirelypets)-- you can usually find coupon codes to offset shipping costs. In the end, much more reasonably priced than buying from the local pet store.",dogs,3
"I have a German Shepherd who was leaving clumps of fur all over the house. Combing him out barely made a difference. My sister recommended Lipoderm to me. After about three weeks of giving it to my dog in his food, I began noticing a major improvement in his coat and a significant decline in shedding. Now, after 5 weeks, his coat is shiny, soft and beautiful with almost no shedding. What a difference! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has similar dog shedding issues.",dogs,3

It's very loud, sturdy and works perfectly.Don't waste your dogs time or your money on any other clicker. BUY THIS ONE ... in my humble opinion ;)",dogs,3
"This is a great product for a great machine! But...the granules are messy. When the cat jumps out of the box, TONS of these granules come with him/her and slowly spread throughout the nearby room. If you dont sweep atleast every 2 days they will pile up. Surprisingly though I dont find I need to refill the CatGenie much to accomodate for this which seems weird but true. I use maybe a light sprinkle from the box every 3-4 months to make sure the catgenie's litter level is maintained.",cats,2

"I bought the 14"" version of this ball for my 12 month old Alapaha Blue-Blood Bulldog pup. It arrived two days ago, and every minute the pup's been in the same room with it, he's been playing with it. He does try to get to the valve, but I think he has no hope. I put about a liter of water in it so it rolls all randomly, which drives him nuts. My older dogs don't care about it at all, but the puppy can not get enough. Highly recommended.",dogs,3
I was very happy to find this product on line because I can not find it where I leave. They are very durable especially for dogs that are very hard on them.

I highly recommend this leash.,dogs,3
"TOO cumbersome- I was hoping for a product that was more user friendly. This thing is heavy- and difficult to extend- and just too much trouble to use. I have used it 3 times in 6 months. Dog hates it, too- but he's older. A younger dog would probably do OK with it. If you've got the muscles and time- it might work for you. But it does take some time & effort to get it into position & take it down again. I would not reorder this product.",dogs,3
"The Drinkwell is fairly easy to get set up and running. The kitty sat in front of it watching it for perhaps 10 minutes before trying to take a drink but after that he was fine with it. I am certain that this has improved his water intake, which is essential for an older kitty to prevent kidney stones. With one cat, the water lasts for 5 days before getting low enough that the pump starts getting noisy (this is the prompt to check the water tank level and fill it).",cats,2

"I have to tell you how I just cut down on litter box cleaning by 10x. I bought this box. We'd had one of these before but the problem was two fold. First our cats need a covered box or they make a huge mess. Second the ""waste"" would clump to the sifter thing which just made it gross. The other day I read on a blog how these are so awesome if you don't follow the directions. You don't use them as the litter box. You use them as a giant scoop. You pick up the litter box, pour all the contents into this. The stuff in the filter you throw out. The litter that goes through you put back in the box. We have three litter boxes. Took me longer to take the lids off than to ""scoop"" them now. You don't get the stuck yuck either because it isn't drying and clumping to the sifter. Best investment in a while",cats,2

"Our dog has allergies and constantly has hot spots, starts licking and before you know it he has a big red ugly hot spot. This works like magic and is an over the counter product????? I have spent hundreds of dollars at the vet, then prescription meds including prednisone which I know is not really good for our dog. This works amazingly quick. Literally takes one coating and by the end of the day the spot already looks better, no redness...it also has an anesthetic component that gives him the relief he needs to stop licking the spot. AMAZING product. It has saved me several trips to the vet!",dogs,3
FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch EdgeI have 3 German Shepherds and have used various rakes etc. but nothing gets the undercoat out like the furminator.

I have recommended it to many people and have recently purchased one for my daughter. Amazon has the cheapest price.,cats,2

"I bought this after seeing a working display at my local pet store because I thought-wow-what a cool idea! My cats love to lick/drink off of surfaces (like the tub, sink, etc) so I thought they'd like this type of fountain. I was a bit concerned about the pump noise since a couple of my cats (I have 8) are a bit twitchy/timid, but there was no problem at all! The pump is very quiet. They didn't notice it at all. And they love it!I've had it now about 2 years & have had no problems. Yes you do have to keep it filled or it tends to ""gurgle"" which is ok with me since it reminds me to add water-usually once or twice a day. And yes you do have to clean it periodically-I can let it go about a month at most-but more often is better of course. I found it easy to disassemble, clean, and reassemble. Replacement filters are readily available and are reasonably priced.Of course it's more work than simply rinsing out a bowl but well *duh* any product like this requires cleaning/maintenance. But it's worth it to me since my cats really love it and seems like they drink more water which is better for their health.Overall I think it's an excellent product and well worth the money. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",cats,2

"Had heard from a friend that this worked for another friend of his, so I thought I would give it a whirl since nothing else seems to help. The first time I put it on, it did seem to work, and my dog seemed to back off from barking and looked dazed and confused about what was going on, but eventually, he powered through and decided what the heck, I don't care. I think he thinks the citronella is a form of cologne for him and makes him smell better. Anyway, I was hoping this would be the solution to my problem, but evidently it isn't. I would not go so far as to say ""it doesn't work"" as I do believe my friend and I do believe others who have said it worked for them, but it just did not do the trick for my wire haired fox terrier. He's two and half and a handful. Anyway, good luck if you do buy it, and I hope it works for you.",dogs,3
"Be aware of sizing - I got the Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat, Medium, Black, and had a hard time deciding on the size. I have a Prius and it has bucket seats in the front and that's where I wanted to put my dog -- up close where I could pet her and we could have a decent conversation.My poodle is a 13 pound miniature and probably would have been okay with the small size, but I am so glad I got the medium size instead. Yes, it is too big. Yes, it compresses slightly when I close the passenger side door. But my dog loves it! She can stand up, change position, rest her head on the Snoozer walls, scrunch her head through the slot where the seatbelt fits, and just plain get comfortable. She loves looking out the car window and is safe and secure in her seatbelt. (I bought a harness to attach the Snoozer seatbelt strap to, so it's more comfortable.) The storage drawer is perfect for putting in extra stuff, but in a Prius, it's a tight fit. It works, just tight. Overall, I love it and it's worth it.Now we travel everywhere together!",dogs,3

"I'm in love! If you can be in love with a litterbox, then this is it! I was skeptical about it as I read some of the negative reviews, but as I hate scooping and the smell I bit the bullit and gave it a try. Some talk about metal clips. I bought the large version as I have 3 cats and it didn't come with metal clips. They are like plastic slides. There are 4 of them. They do look a little flimsy and I will be very careful with them. I'm actually only gonna use them when I figure the box needs a good cleaning. As of yet I've only needed to add some litter and i just put it in through the opening as not to mess with the slides. I love how I just need to roll it over and back and voila, just slide out the catch and deposit in trash. I love it! I can't stress it enough. I guess to me the only con would be is the space required to roll it over, but is not an issue with me. I just use no name brand clumping cat litter and it works just fine. Go for it, you have nothing to lose but the scoop!",cats,2
"We bought one for my home office, and my largest cat loved it but couldn't fully fit on it (he likes to stretch out when he sleeps). He was doing whatever he could to make it work. So then we bought a second one to put right next to the first, and his reaction was one of pure love and ecstasy. One cat can get on each, although the largest will share space from the other. (we have no small cats) But since we have three cats, and sometimes petsit a fourth, that area gets crowded sometimes, and there are hissing fights. I don't have quite enough window space for a third.Right now I'm looking for replaceable covers, and I'm not having much luck. We've had these for a few years, and try to keep them cleaned, but it's a pain. We need to replace them.",cats,2
"Given the chance, my dog inhales her dry food and swallows it without chewing. This ball has been the answer! She really enjoys rolling it around, and uses her nose and her paws to maneuver it. My dog gets 1 cup of kibble in the morning and another in the evening, and it takes 7-10 minutes for her to empty the ball. It's entertaining to watch. Unlike some of the other reviewers' dogs, mine doesn't chew the ball apart, so I've only gone through 2 in 1.5 years. Had purchased at a pet big box store before, but will now order from Amazon because it's several dollars cheaper! Also - did notice the odor when ball was new but it went away in a day or two.",dogs,3
"I gave a one only rating due to my dog's reaction.My Boxer would love these but the new batch even smells different and after giving him 1 or 2 treats his back paws became red and a little swollen.So, I took him to the vet and we eliminated all the foods except these, what do you know, pinky swollen paws.So, my dog can't have these and I'm left with 2 &1/2 bags.This never happened before with Plato Duck and Chicken treats and I'm very sorry but now ordered Milo's Kitchen from Amazon.",dogs,3
"This was the exact product I was searching for so I was very happy and satisfied. I have ordered products from other vendors only to discover it was basically falsely advertised to LOOK like the name brand I wanted but WAS NOT THAT PRODUCT , and therefore I refused to use it for fear of doing harm to my pets! Nutramax Cosequin is an EXCELLENT supplement with wonderful results. I have used with 2 of my geriatric kitties and have seen marked improvement in mobility from arthritis or just cranky bones for aging kitties. My vet is a big advocate of this product as well, but I was able to purchase at a much better price through Amazon. My advice is to ALWAYS do your homework and triple check ALL INGREDIENTS to be sure whatever product you are searching for is NOT A KNOCK OFF!! Thank you very much!",cats,2
"I was a little skeptical when buying this, worried if I wasted money and my cat hates it. SO glad my fears were not needed! My cat LOVES IT! It's perfect for my apartment. It sits right outside the bathroom and I've had several guests comment on ""what a nice table"" - imagine their shock when they find out it's the litter box! It's sturdy, cute, and totally non-conspicuous. it n ever smells, he never drags litter out with him. When I first built it and put the littler in, my cat was a little nervous, it seemed like too nice of a thing to pee in. But after that first time, he's bopping right in and out of it (I think he enjoys the privacy himself!). Do not hesitate to get this, you will not regret it!",cats,2
"UPDATE - This Product IS NOT WORTH 4 STARS simply because it is automatic. I couldn't keep it in the bedroom because it is a motor after all and is by no means whisper quiet! The noise is enough to wake the dead. I could hear it from the living room.It takes 20 minutes to cycle after Kitty leaves the box. Sitting undisturbed is my ""guesstimation"" on why the pee eventually sinks into the ENTIRE Slightly Plastic Covered CARDBOARD CARTRIDGE. It will need to be replaced WAAAAY before 2 weeks... at about $20 a cartridge (including S&H;) you better have a bottomless bank account.I suggest using a thick piece of Plastic Carpet Protector under the entire unit. You will need it! You can get it by the roll at Home Depot.The Cartridges Are OBSCENELY EXPENSIVE considering the use you get out of them.if you expect it to last EVEN TWO WEEKS, you need to remove the Poo EVERY FEW DAYS from the end of the cartridge, by hand - a pooper scooper really doesn't fit in the tiny covered area. It is not that simple of a task. It takes awhile to pull it all out than just cleaning a regular kitty litter box. Bad back - NO WAY! You will need to wear GLOVES and a GAS MASK or hold your breath for a long time.I bought the DOME LID, over $25.00 with shipping, for the thing! But still, even with the hood - Phee-U-weey coming out from the front of the Litter box!The cat litter is less than 3 inches deep in the entire cartridge. The more it cycles the litter goes down very quickly.I believe that helps contributes to the odor issue.I tried every type of Clumping Litter on the market. I also switched her to all dry Science Diet cat food.I even used the HEAVILY PERFUMED Multiple Cat Liter. The Poo BACKS UP in the tiny Poo catcher area. It is about 4 or 5 inch wide by about 15 inches long, NOT REALLY DEEP, Poo catcher area. This is NOT the only issue that makes it fail the ""ODOR EATER TEST"" here.The rake just pushes the poo into the SPACE and the Poo accumulates and backs up very quickly. It is at the front of the box - so the Dome Lid is useless.OH did I forget to mention the disgusting Poo that gets smeared and Gobs get stuck on your rake? You get big time stink there. Cleaning it is such a ""high."" It dries quickly if you do not get to it right away too. It wouldn't come off with a knife as I tried to scrape it off.Also, the rake stops too soon when the Poo backs up because the little cardboard flap door stays open a smidgen from the backed up Poo. **THE CYCLE STOPS** As in doesn't run anymore - won't cycle back to rake the next kitty dump.BTW - You will lose a lot of expensive Litter too. Every cycle, a bunch of GOOD LITTER will slide into the tiny Poo catcher, which also backed the Poo Catcher up very quickly!Oh Yes... I forgot to mention, Every changing you have to get rid of the huge CARDBOARD CARTRIDGE. Just try to move the HUGE Stinky, SOGGY, LIMP, Wet - don't forget HUGE disgusting Cartridge. And it really is HUGE and horribly stinky. It will always be dripping foul matter as you try and get it into a ""Lawn Size Garbage Bag."" You will get drippings on your carpet or floor eventually. Murphys Law. The harder you try NOT to drip, you will miss the bag somewhere... usually while you are choking and trying to STOP THE GAG FACTOR!Ask yourself this question. What happens when a Cat pees on slightly plastic coated cardboard - over and over again for two weeks?I knew real quick I made a mistake here. They say it has a quiet motor and that didn't pan out. Then, I was stuck having to pay $15.99 per cartridge and you don't save a PENNY buying the 3 pack! The shipping is OUTRAGEOUS! They got you by the nose hairs here if you buy this unit.It took me weeks to GIVE THIS EXPENSIVE set up, WITH HOOD away. Nobody wanted it. LOLI saved my money for months to replace this Stinky Monstrosity with the really Expensive LITTER ROBOT! It was worth every Penny. I have had it for over two years and never had an ODOR problem. I can use KITCHEN GARBAGE BAGS once a week. It ties shut and no odor there.BTW - NO LOSS OF GOOD LITTER EITHER. The Litter Robot sifts the litter out from the clumps and only the clumps goes down into the big deep drawer that is lined with a ""Kitchen Garbage"" bag. I get 15 for $.99 at the dollar store. That's 15 weeks for $.99.Also, I am not throwing away good litter and saving money there too! I buy a bucket of Fresh Step every couple of months. My house is odor free and I have more than paid for this unit now with the money I saved by not paying $19.00 a cartridge every week and a half.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. You will replace it. I guarantee it.Look at the long picture.52 weeks in a yearReplace every 2 weeks...26 weeks @ over $20.00 a cartridge if you include shipping.That is $520.00 a year in soggy wet - dripping, stinky CARDBOARD cartridges that will leak all over your floor.Not to mention all the litter you waste between the rake scooping it in the Poop Catcher area - and having to replace all the litter in the cartridge every changing.If you can afford it... get the LITTER ROBOT - just Google it and see the amazing video. I suggest the one with the bubble for the cats to turn around in it. I have a small cat and she is cramped inside. They didn't have that feature when I got mine.Also if you have a BAD BACK... do not get this item. It requires more ""maintenance"" from Rake and Poo back up problems nearly every day. The problems require you to stay bent over for a long period of time and my back just couldn't take it!",cats,2
"I waited a few months before posting my review as I wanted to know just how effective this product would be. Let me just say I'm 100% impressed. I am the proud owner of 3 Pomeranians and 2 cats. Both my cats had decided taking up residency in my formal dining room was acceptable, and one of my Poms decided (after years of being potty trained) that he wanted to deficate on the Persian rug in the dining room. The way the room is designed they could get in from two directions; hence I purchased two Contech Stay Away Motion Deterrants. I put one at each corner, and put them both in the spray and beep mode. Within a matter of a few days my Pom, Bishop, stopped entering the room. My cats tested the area a few times. The units, as others noted, didn't ALWAYS go off, but I found it depended on how much light was entering the motion sensor so after moving them around a little, walla, the CATS now understand that our formal dining room is just that, a place to eat and not a place for them to prowl. My home is a split wing and I do not like my dogs going into the guest bedrooms nor do I like the cats to go into the guest rooms as they often believe the human bed is theirs. Since some of our guests have mild pet alergies I wanted to try and keep the pets off the bed, so I moved both units from the dining room into the hallway. I put one on each side and guess what, in just one week they do NOT go down the hallway. I tried removing the units completely from the hall and dining room; however, my pets all believe they are still there and are afraid to even come near the hall or the dining room. This unit works like a gem! I highly recommend this if you have a cat getting onto something they are not intended to jump on or even for a dog entering a room or eliminating in one location. I also have purchased a Scat Mat from Contech, both the active one and the fake mat, and these have also worked to keep my dogs away from the litter box. Contech makes amazing products. I've had my Scat Mat for 6 years and it's still working like a pro!!!! I bought both my products on Amazon as they always seem to have the best price compared to my local pet stores.",cats,2

"I purchased the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box at PetSmart for around $37. I purchased an XL box for my two, overweight, adult kitties to share. The arrangement seems to work well for both cats. We have no other cat boxes in our home.For under $40, the box was a steal when compared to the Littermaid. We considered a Littermaid, but it was just too expensive for so many fair and poor Amazon reviews. We took a chance on the Omega Paw, and my husband and I haven't been disappointed. There are a few, minor flaws but is it really possible to perfect such an undesirable chore? When you roll the cat box, a small amount of litter falls through the sides. Also, smaller poop and clumped urine falls through the sifter and doesn't get included in the removable scoop. There is always small amounts of poop and clumped urine floating around in the box even after being rolled and cleaned. Other than that, we haven't had any real problems. I wish the box came with a door flap (to keep in smelly poop odors), and we'll have to purchase a rug because plenty of litter can be found outside of the box as with any box. I give it four out of five stars. I recommend it for those on a budget.",cats,2
"K9 Advantix Flea Control for Dogs 21-55 Pounds, 6 PackK9 Advantix 12 Pk Red Dog 21-55 LbsI have three dogs and use this on the every month during the summer. Even after camping trips and the runs through the woods that they love to do when I take them by my parents farm, I have never had a flee or tick on either of the three. If you are not smart enough to call your vet instead of the number on the box in an emergency then you should avoid this product and all other products. In fact you should avoid owning pets period.That being said I cannot say the same for when I used Frontline. My dogs would have ticks all the time and once in a while even a flea. Product leaves fur a little more oily than frontline but is much much better as this product repels and kills fleas, ticks and mequitos. Frontline only kills fleas and ticks (when it feels like it).",dogs,3

"On the front of the box, along with all the other great Scoop Free attributes, are the words ""whisper quiet motor."" Well, the motor itself may be that quiet, but the rest of the moving parts make enough noise to wake the dead.When the rake moves back and forth in its track, it's quite noisy. But what's even worse, as the rake moves, it twice changes its angle by flipping in its track. As it does so, it makes a VERY loud clunk. Maybe if you live in a house and stick the litter box in the basement, that's fine. But if you're in a one bedroom apartment, there is no avoiding that sound in the middle of the night.Secondly, the instructions tell you to place the Scoop Free unit near the old litter box until your cat(s) become acclimated to it. Given its large footprint, however, that may not be practical. Also, many people keep their litter boxes in the bathroom; in its instructions, the Scoop Free recommends against that because of the humidity.",cats,2

"GrassSaver was recommended by a local pet food supply company. This product appeared to work, but after 4 days my border collie got severely ill. She lost her appetite and quit drinking completely. She wouldn't drink water, chicken broth, or pedialite. The vet wouldn't say that it was the cause. She only would say it has an extremely large amount of chemicals; some of which are used to settle the dogs stomach. She stated all of these products have probiotics to help with digestive problems created by the rest of the chemicals in this product. This product is dangerous to border collies, which under normal standards they can eat natural foods such as road kill, but highly chemicalized foods such as dog treats can upset their stomach. This was a good price, except thet $230 vet bill that had to be added to save her life.Granulized Gypsum or gypsum can change the PH levels to reduce the acid burn.

He wraps them around his paws to chew on, loops them on door stops for the 'twang' fun, tosses them in the air and brings them to me to throw for him (the only thing he fetches--self taught by the way). They are quiet and don't hurt your feet at o'dark hundred when wandering around the house. My cat even plays with them in bed next to me and I never wake up!

I have the pads on timer switches to go on in the AM before I leave for work & off when I arrive home in the evening. The dogs have the option stay outside in the kennel to go in the cottage and lay on their pads during the day. I do check every AM to make sure the pads are warm before I leave for work. When I come home they seem happy & warm. At this point I am very happy with my purchase. I like the fact that they are hard plastic, washable, and the cord has protection from chewing.",dogs,3
"We got this for our new puppy that is supposed to become a full sized 50-60lb dog. Currently we have the divider set in it so she only uses about a 1/3 of the crate currently. While using the divider you unfortunately can't slide the bottom tray out of the crate to clean it. The crate itself is pretty durable as since our dog is still a puppy, she tends to try and chew on things and I've caught her trying to chew on the bars some and they've held up just fine. Another sign it is very durable is its weight. It's heavy, which is good but not good for when you want to move it around. The crate folds in on itself easily enough which makes tear down and and setup pretty easy, its just the carrying part is a little difficult with the weight of it. Overall I'm very happy with the crate and my puppy should grow into it quite nicely.",dogs,3

The ""Ultra"" in the title refers only to the better cushioned handle; there is no ultra Chuckit ball included. Additionally, I ordered what I expected to be a regular sized Chuckit! but was sent an item labeled "" Chuckit! Ultra Grip Ball Launcher Medium/Moyen ""(great marketing move for Canadians, eh?).

"I cannot say enough good things about this! I have a hyper active, super energetic 8-month lab retriever and no matter how much I do in a day to exhaust him, it's not enough. Enter Chuck-it, which is like a godsend. It helps that he loves fetch but if your dog isn't ball obsessed, this may not be for you. But mine is, thankfully. It was nice to have a ball come with the ball launcher and it is a nice bright orange, which makes it easy to spot. The ball launcher has an intuitive design and fits my hand perfectly. It took me a while to understand how to use it properly and for the first few days, I couldn't achieve the distance I would have liked to. But once you get how to use it, it's easy! The ball goes pretty far out and that makes the dog run, run, run... and tire himself out. This makes him come home and pass out and that is very good news for me. I would've liked to get the Chuck-it ball, instead of the tennis ball version that came with it but it will do for now.

"I had, in my teen years, WAY over-exercised and my knee and hip joints really started hurting in my 20's. I sometimes had to fall out of bed to get out of it. I wish I could remember how I learned about Synflex--it wasn't an advertisement. I started taking it, in any case, and WOW I can't tell you how much better I felt. I don't always take it consistently these days (I'm 42 now) but I still have no pain. I gave my mom some for her fingers, which are starting to go crooked, and they helped her, too.The biggest story, though, is about my beagle. She is 9 years old, and had been having seizures and accidents in the house for a year. One day she could hardly walk at all, and for the next few days she barely moved. I made the decision to euthanize her poor little sweet self so she wouldn't have to suffer. It was the weekend, so it would have to wait until Monday. In the meantime, I went ahead and researched beagles online.Found out that dogs in general can have seizures when they are in tremendous pain. Seizures don't necessarily have to be caused by brain and nerve troubles. I decided I would give my dog Synflex (beef flavor smells like vomit but she loves it), along with some fish oil that I ordered from *Drs. Foster & Smith*, and in a few days I had a beagle PUPPY, not a 9-year old dog! She started jumping on people like she did years ago (bad dog) and running out the front door like when she was younger (bad dog) -- I don't like her doing these things, but the fact that she is able to is so exciting.No more seizures, no more accidents in the house at all, and no more pain. People, please try this before putting your dog down. Sure wish I would have thought of it when I had my Doberman.Try it for your own body -- it just works. I recommend taking Carlson Salmon Oil liquid-caps with it daily. Your joints will thank you.",dogs,3

"I have both the bristle brushes, wire brushes and the furminator deshedding tools and my cats hate all of them. We bought the dog version of this for our pups to help with bath time and grooming (which is equally amazing) and I decided to try it out on the cats. It was huge and awkward but worked amazingly on the cats and they loved it. We have 3 kitties and none of them like the other brushes we've used in the slightest and dart away when we get them out or brush them for more than a minute at a time. Since the dog brush worked so well, I bought the smaller kitty specific version. Our huge 18lb cat who hates being affectionate will lay in my lap for 30 minutes just to get brushed now. It seems like every time I clean the brush out, it fills up immediately after. It's ability to reach the undercoat is actually impressive. I alternate between a circular motion and going with the root of the fur. It doesn't trap and hold absolutely every hair, but it's easy enough to clean up so it's not a huge deal. The gentle teeth give a soft massage for your kitty's skin and evidently feels wonderful, so it's a good trade off. It's soft enough to brush the sides of their face, their head and the delicate areas around their legs and tummy without fear of hurting them or irritating skin. It's so much better than fighting them to brush their fur. Great buy!",cats,2

I like the idea of being able to take this one on trips and still keep my dog contained. My only complaint is the range is not as large as I had hoped. I have to keep the unit on the back wall of my house. Even then, the range does not extend the distance of my moderately sized yard.",dogs,3
"Even though the hedgehog as a baby is usually one of my dog's favorite toys, he still doesn't seem to get that there are eggs INSIDE this toy, even after showing him. Much better are theKyjen PP01055 Hide-A-Bee Pet Toy, Largeor theKyjen PP01056 Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy, Large, because it is clear when they look at it that it is a large plush item, but that babies are inside each ""window"", because they LOOK like babies. The eggs in this toy simply look like non-descript ""balls"". Not as much fun.So even though he knows they are in there, he has a lot more fun with the bees, the squirrels, or even the rabbits in theKyjen Magic Hat with Rabbits Puzzle Plush Interactive Dog Toy.Can't really recommend this toy except as a regular hedgehog.",dogs,3
It looked bigger and beatiful. When I received it I was discontent but the price of the product was 17.20 and I paid 46.99. I said probably it was a mistake and they charged me the right amount. What a surprise. I was charged 46.99 and not the combined amount when you bought the seed for the birds together. I called amazon and they told me to speak with outdoor livings. They said the product was 46.99. What a rip off. Becareful buying things online these days. I have been buying things in the internet for years without any problem but I will stop this practice. It is better to see the product with your own eyes first.,birds,0
"I previously bought 2 of the medium sized bowls for my larger dogs and they worked really well so when one of my smaller dogs started choking down his food, we bought 2 small bowls recently.They really slow them down and do not tip over easily. I have to work at it just to pick them up sometimes because they are made so well to stay on the floor. None of my dogs have ever tipped them over or figured out another way to defeat their purpose.I have already recommended them to others and would continue to recommend them to anyone with a dog that needs to slow down their eating.",cats,2
I use these wipes on my very furry dog who occasionally needs a little help in her behind quarters. She's one of those dogs who has a lot of fur around her rear. Malacetic wipes work very well to deodorize and remove any offending bits of waste. They're worth the price. I'll always keep these around. Highly recommended.,cats,2
I think the concept is great but my Weimaraner destroyed it the first day! He pulled out the plug and chewed it up! He swallowed pieces and ended up vomiting. So I had quite the mess to clean up! I was hoping it would last a bit longer and keep him occupied while I was at work. I wanted a refund or to exchange for a different item but the company would only replace it! Which doesn't help! So now he can only play with it while i am sitting with him and watching him. So don't get it if your pup likes to chew at all.,dogs,3
"Took this well built, sturdy scratch post out of the box. Usually the first thing the cat does is to climb into the empty box.

"After trying multiple ways to stop our beloved dog from his almost constant barking, and none of them working, we finally gave in to this static collar. Not only is our family more at peace, but our dog is more peaceful and calm. He is definitely much happier since he isn't consumed with his barking. At first it was odd not having him bark, like he lost his voice, but it is so much better not having him bark at EVERYTHING!!! For anyone skeptical...give it a try. You will enjoy your dog so much more!UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW~ we are sending the bark collar back. For some reason, it has stopped working completely. When we replace the battery it works for a few days, then nothing. I wish it would've continued on with it's original success with our dog, as his barking is once more a disruption to his peace and calm. I'm very disappointed that it didn't work. Loved the results when it was functioning properly though! Off to find something else to help. Good luck to you all.",dogs,3

"I have an adopted pup named Puzzle--she's about the size of a collie (40-45 lbs) and the medium was a perfect size for her. She can &#34;nest&#34; in it and still have plenty of room to stretch if she wants to. She's a dark brown color (like a chocolate lab) and the khaki has been a great shade in hiding her dog hair from the average eye, and it's neutral enough to fit in with the decor without looking ugly. I haven't tried washing it yet so I can't review how well that will work, but I'm sure it will be fine. The best thing is that my husband and I don't have to kick her out of our bed at night anymore--she leaves willingly to go sleep in her new bed!",dogs,3
"I use pee pads in the house only when no one is home or overnight.I work from home, so 90% of the time I am home and available to let our chihuahua out to use the bathroom.I have noticed that she will pee once, and sometimes twice overnight and the pad doesnt hold the pee all of the time. The other pads I have used have never had this issue.Also, when I pulled the pads out of the bag, sometimes the corners of the pad would be stuck folded into the middle of the pad and when I would pull it apart the pad would rip and I would have cotton coming out from the pad..So, after trying these pads for about 5 days...

I think the fact that the tension is in the front makes a big different to them psychology. The harness also pulls them off balance if they try to stray or pull more than they should.GREAT GREAT buy, now walks are calm and enjoyable.",dogs,3

"Does your wonderful feline love to knock over its water all the time with its paws? One of mine used to live just to do that! Loved to paw it over, water everywhere. Delightful! He really enjoyed destruction!No more. Ha, ha...I got them Bergan's Petite Gourmet Combo. They no longer think I'm a dummy cause I believe it would take a lion to knock over a Bergan's. (It would be nice if some instructions came with the Combo). You have to figure it out yourself, but it never hurts to think once in awhile.It's a bit tricky to get the food to run 100%. I think cat food would have to be shaped like marbles. A tap with a hammer (no...no...your palm will do - or a big stick)!! On the watering trough you need some clean water already in the bowl, or you'll run half the water container down. Try a quarter or half a quart to start, perhaps. They work pretty good, not perfect (like us)? Colors may vary - from gray to gray.

"The nice high edges really help quite a bit with keeping the area clean. With a 20lb cat that used to pour off the edges of a normal sized litter box and an overzealous kitten throwing dirt for fun, this thing really does it's job. Another advantage is that with it's size, you can put way more litter in the box, meaning scraping clumps up is much easier since there's less stuck on the bottom of the pan. Even with I get lazy after a couple days, there is way less odor and it's easier to clean with the extra litter. Daily smell is down dramatically",cats,2
"This is one of the best grooming tools I have used on my dog, which is a Norwegian Elk Hound with a very thick coat.

In the past I have had to sweep the house everyday to pick up Doogie's hair. Since I started using the Furminator I only clean up every 2-3 days. If you don't already own this tool, buy it now, but only if you have a long haired dog.I bought one of these for my girl friend to use on her German Shepherd and she said not only did her dog not like it, she said it did nothing to reduce the hair she found in the house.So, long, thick coat great.

"I only have had the ScoopFree for a few days. There are two models. I got the upscale one. I have one cat who is 1.5 years old. I installed the box and removed his old box. I put just a small amount of his old litter over the crystals. About two hours after he used the box and has used it ever since. I will use all crystals when I change the litter cartridge how ever that long that is. I immediately noticed a lack of odor. The box comes with a button where you can change the setting on the time between the cat using the box and when it comes on and rakes the litter. It comes preset to 20 minutes. That works fine for me. An indicator shows you how often he has used the box. That is neat. If he used the box there is a light that blinks between the time he used it and the 20 minutes you have it set for so you know it will soon be coming on. The noise did not bother my cat at all. When he heard it he came to investigate. If you get the upscale model like I got be sure and read the fly-er that comes with the box as it has the updated instructions for the new control panel. I looked at the manual first and it was for the downscale model and some of the lights I have did not show which left me confused until I picked up the enclosed fly-er. I thought it was advertising. You do not need any brains to speak of to use this. I usually put something together before I read the instructions so one thing I missed was that there are two magnets on the litter cartridge and two on the box. When you put the box over the litter cartridge the magnets should line up and you will hear a little click as you let the box down. Also be sure and place the top of the litter cartridge under the litter tray when you slide it under the box. I am only three days into this and I sure do not miss emptying the litter box twice a day. Now I can look in there and see how many times he went to the box each day. Might help you if your cat is ill and going to the box a lot. There is a tray that you can buy and just fill with litter yourself and save some $$$ but you will need to wash it down. If you only have one cat that is probably only once a month which I could live with. I don not know if it has the magnets on it. I ordered one so will know soon enough. I read you can buy them on eBay. I ordered my from Amazon. I think it was about $25 but you could pay for that real quick when you look at the price of cartridges. I had a hook that came with mine but I am not using it. My cat had never used a hood so I did not want to lay all that stress on him at once. The manual says you should keep your old litter box by the new one for about 7-10 days. Not me. I immediately took it out and with the little bit of his old type litter I put in to cover the crystals worked fine. Now you can hardly see the old litter. I am still going to keep an extra cartridge around as I am tired of washing out cat boxes. I have 5 cats that live in the garage or outside when they want to go out. It is heated and cooled so they spend more time in than out and never never stay out at night. Not in the last 4 years. Ther are all former strays and I have had them all for over ten years. They have found the good life and when out side never leave my backyard. Amazing for a cat.The unit comes in a giant box. You can send it back if you or your cat do not like it. When unpacking be sure and do not miss the little electric cord and transformer . It is in a small whit box. I thought they had left mine out until I dug around and found it. It comes with one litter tray cartridge so you are ready if your cat is ready to go up scale.I sure recommend the unit with the timer and the window that show you the number of times your cat has used the box. That plus the hood cost about $34 more. From the pictures you cannot tell what the difference is.It is some months later since my first post (Feb 2011) and I like the litter box even more. I have never had a problem. I have no odor problem. My stray cat is still with me and is an indoor cat. When the unit is in operation he sometimes likes to jump back in and play. I normally change the box after about 80 uses which is around 3-4 weeks. That is why I really like the counter that shows how many uses the cat has made. It takes me about 5-10 minutes to throw the old one away and place the new one under the unit. No touching of the litter is required at all. I was looking at one of the new models today which had a nice feature. Instead of changing the entire bottom box you just change the plastic container that holds the feces/urine and add a little litter. After looking at the cost of the litter and the container boxes it would actually be less expensive per month than my current box. Also, it would be easier as you would just lift up the little plastic container box and dispose of. If mine ever wears out I will give this a go. I am 100% sold on these electric litter boxes and I have had cats for over 60 years. No odor, no touching of litter and best of all my cat likes it. We have come a long way from shredded up newspapers or real sand. P.S. You really do not need a hooded cover as the box scoops the litter into an unseen container.",cats,2

"I bought this for my porkie 12 pound Pomeranian and we are extraordinarily happy with it. She used to be a ridiculous nightmare in the car, because she wants to see outside and she wants to be close to me. She fits great, has room to turn around, can curl up and sleep in it, and she can easily see out the window. She always wears her harness which attaches to a clip on the device so she can't jump out. We drive for hours and she is very content and comfortable (of course we stop periodically for walkabouts). If I have a passenger, I hang the dog's car seat on the back of the passenger seat and she faces the back. That way, she's still close to me and she can still see outside. The bottom strap of the car seat has never interfered with my passengers' comfort in the front. It's lightweight, the straps are super easy to adjust, and it's secure and affordable. Terrific choice. I highly recommend this device.",dogs,3
"Good-sized, affordable, thick straw mats that my two rabbits love to lie on almost as much as they love to chew. So why three stars instead of five? *They pack them with silica gel packs that are dangerous for your pet!* This is not the first time I've gotten a rabbit toy with a silica gel pack along with it that's so small it fell out of the package without my noticing and landed where my pets could get at it, and it was only sheer luck that it caught my eye before they got to it; rabbits, being the goat wannabes that they are, would certainly eat it, presumably causing sickness or even death. It's unacceptable.Now, I don't know exactly what a silica gel pack does and maybe it's important to include them with the item, but if so, just put in a large notice along with the product warning the customer that the gel pack is there and needs to be disposed of when you open the package. Do that, and get the full five stars. But as it is, this product is *dangerous* for those who are unaware these packets are being included.",bunny rabbit central,1

"I needed a bag for airline travel and previously owned a Sherpa Bag. That was years ago. I have a chi-poo named Vinny who is a little over a year old. He currently weighs about 7.5 pounds. He was a little smaller when I purchased this bag but not much. First of all, Sherpa bags are wonderful. I was browsing Amazon for a bag and saw this one. It is beautiful. I used to own the red one a few years bag. Anyway, I loved the houndstooth pattern and the color. I wanted a bag that looked good, was functional AND was accepted on airlines. Sherpa has the guarantee so I purchased this one. I knew Vinny would fit in it with no problems and he did. It has top and side entrances. The Panels, I call them windows, are mesh and it has roll up flaps on three sides. It comes with a convenient should strap and large accessory pocket that zips. Vinny is crate trained so he is comfortable with bags.As soon as this one arrived, I set it up for him. He sniffed it and walked around and then when in to sniff more. Then he laid down. I only use this bag from air travel and that has only been once since I have had Vinny. Now, we flew SW Airlines and I had Vinny in the bag. I went to the counter so I could purchase his ticket and let them check the bag. The lady was a complete witch. She was not helpful and was extremely rude. She started looking at my bag and asked if he could fit in there. I said yes and told her that he was IN the bag lying down. I sat it down and unzipped the top so she could see. Vinny sat up and his head stuck out of the bag. Then she said that the bag was too small for him AND too big for the plane. I told her no it wasn't too small for him. Then she said that he needed to be able to turn around in the bag. I told her that he could. She still was telling me that the bag was too small for him but too big for the flight. Suddenly, she told me that I needed to purchase their branded carrier. That ugly thing was even smaller than my bag so I couldn't understand why she thought he would fit in there. I was getting so frustrated. I took Vinny out and set him down so he could walk back in the bag. Then she said well when he sits down, his head sticks out. DUH!! I told her he wouldn't sit up during the flight because I would not have the top open. He would most likely be lying down. Then she said well if it doesn't fit, I would be kicked off the plane. I just said ok and paid for his ticket. I had read reviews on Amazon and some other places about this bag and them saying it did fit under the seats but I started to worry. I noticed other people carrying bags that looked larger than mine. We get on the plane and get to our seats and the bag fit just fine. On our return flight, we had no issues at all. I even told the lady about the problems I had with the SW agent before we left. She looked at my bag and said, 'it's a Sherpa! It's fine."" This bag does fit under the seats on SW Airlines and Vinny was very happy in it.I got all sorts of compliments on the bag because it is so gorgeous. I'm very happy with this bag and so is Vinny.",dogs,3

I like that is had a nice handle for carrying, and for the size its very lightweight. I bought this for my 120lb great dane. who is abou 30 inches at the withers. The length and width are plenty for her, and since she is a little tall I love that it has the zip-open roof.

"First, this crate is a really great price. I bought a dog bed to fit inside, and then started to worry if the divider wouldn't fit as a result. But, no worries! It fits great, since the divider isn't flush with the pan.Secondly, this crate arrived super fast! It was really easy to unfold and set up. It's just as easy to take apart and store under a couch or bed when not in use.I didn't want a plastic crate for two reasons. The first being that I hate the smell of plastic and didn't want the pup inhaling all those chemicals. The other reason I didn't want a plastic crate is that they typically have only a few holes so you can't see what's happening in the crate unless you are looking in from the door. This crate can be covered with a blanket when you want to give the dog some shade, but otherwise it's great to be able to monitor your puppy from any angle.Lastly, the overall construction is superb.

"The product worked fine for 18 months but then became erratic. Our cat started losing weight because the food had started coming out at half the rated rate, and half the rate it was coming out before. I noted that the warranty on the unit is 90 days, an indication of an unreliable product. I called customer service, who answered on a noisy telephone line. Appears to be a call center in India. I ended up ordering a replacement part online, but got no e-mail confirmation from the web transaction. For the replacement part they only accepted PayPal, indicating they are a lesser business and cannot obtain a real credit card account. After a few days I sent an e-mail asking for an order confirmation, but received none. Note that my online account statement showed the payment had been received. A few days later I called customer service, who answered on the same noisy phone line. Overall the product has a poor warranty, is not reliable, and the business operation is sketchy.",cats,2

"I had bought one of these Harnesses for my Pug and it worked very well. So I bought 2 more for my other 2 Doggies. It makes it much safer to walk and train them than a standard Harness. It pulls their front shoulders together should they get ahead of you so they tend to back off and stay at your side where they belong. The choker style collar is the worst. For a Pug especially, it can cause the eyes to pop out of the socket. So I would suggest this collar for all types of dogs. Amazon was the best deal. I bought 2 store returns here for $10 less than the original one I bought at P---s---t.Ron",dogs,3

Now I have the setting on the collar set to the beep level, when he hears it beep he will dang near jump out of his skin to get back where he needs to be. Even true love couldn't get him to cross his boundary, he wanted to so bad but just wasn't brave enough to make that leap. So I recommend this collar and the radio system.",dogs,3

"Our year old foster dog just wasn't getting the ""no bark"" training. We didn't want our neighbor to complain so we had to do something. We'd done everything the professional trainer recommended. Since that didn't work, he recommended this collar and it's worked very well. The only negative is that it doesn't always work when we're in another room - guess because of the solid walls that block the signal. Other than that, we're very pleased and would recommend it for a resistant dog who doesn't respond to the normal training techniques. It took only 2 days to make a huge difference. The dog now wears the collar but it doesn't have any batteries in it.",dogs,3

"After a month of investigating automated pet feeding and watering devices for my pet cat, I finally selected this five pound model by Ergo Systems. It was not an easy process, many of the consumer product reviews regarding the various available models seemed to be either plugs or diatribes. Clerks at local pet stores tried to be helpful, but none of the stores I visited carry these devices in stock so close inspection and particular model recommendations were unobtainable. The best they could offer were vendor recommendations based on reputation. I finally made my decision based on design specifications, vendor highlighted features, and the most discernibly objective reviews available.This particular feeder requires some minor assembly, although it is relatively easy to perform. The individual parts appear engineered to assemble and disassemble as to facilitate easy cleaning. Automated feeders require regular cleaning so that your pet's meals are not contaminated with dirt, dust, or other undesirable elements. The dish fits snugly, but is easy to detach for daily cleaning.The programmable timer is intuitive, you set the ""on"" and ""off"" time for eight intervals. These times regulate the portion dispensed to the bowl by turning the feeder on and off. Be certain to read the instructions, this timer appears to be originally designed as a security implementation (it has a random time interval feature, probably for controlling lighting to give the appearance of someone being at home.) It is very easy to set for automatic feeding, override to dispense manually, or disable, but use of this feature requires careful attention to the fact that the automatic feeding facility only works properly when shifting from ""OFF"" to ""AUTO.""The one complaint I have about this product is that the lid on the top takes some patience to remove and replace. It is easy (although unnecessary) to twist the lid on too tightly.Overall, I rate this product as excellent. It's feed mechanism is designed around a large plastic screw that turns slowly when engaged so I don't expect fast, excessive parts wear and look forward to years of reliable service from the unit. Provided my expectation of it's lifespan is met, I will replace it with the same model when it does become unreliable.",cats,2
Setup is a bit of a hassle and hard to get used to. Also the clock runs fast so you have to adjust it periodically. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.,cats,2
"I owned one of the older littermaids for nearly 4 years and it worked well. Unfortunately, it finally broke down after 4.5 years and I had to buy a new one.Because my old one was so dependable, I thought I'd stick with the same brand. Bad mistake.I bought one of the new Elite Mega Littermaids and it did not even work work a full two days. It stopped working and has never regained its functionality. Now I have an expensive manual litter box that I have to go and clean all the time.Save yourself the time and money and get another product. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this.",cats,2
"Around 5 weeks ago my family and I bought a Mountain Cur and as he's gotten older his barking has increased. My neighbors also have two young dogs and I saw they had a lot of success with their anti-bark dog collars (which happen to be the shock variety) so I decided to do some research. There are tons of brands to go with along with hundreds of reviews with each of them and I've been torn as to which to buy. A shock collar seems a bit excessive but yesterday I finally had enough! So I went to my a local pet store (the don't carry the shock)and the owner recommended I try the Innotek Anti-Bark Citronella Spray Collar. He stated that his other customers have raved about it and boy was he spot on! I've seen results immediately! His barking has stopped and it's sensitive enough that it will spray if he whines loud enough! The only draw back is the Citronella smell, I'm not a big fan of it but apparently he isn't either so in the end as long as it works I will learn to live with the smell, I also wish you could attach it to any collar not just the one provided. I am leery about him not having his tags on and the collar in the kit doesn't have an attachment for tags. So if your dog barks and your on the fence regarding the shock collar give the Innotek Anti-Bark Citronella Spray Collar a try. I would recommend you purchase off of Amazon because I paid double the price listed on here at my pet store!Side note...It does have an off switch so you don't have to keep taking it off and on. Lastly I'm not sure how long a can of the spray lasts, the directions say the collar will last approx 18-25 sprays but the can of citronella doesn't state how many sprays it contains. Good luck to others who have pups that bark....",dogs,3

"as our dog grows, so did her food supply! when we first got her we werent really prepared it was a rescue situation so we ran to the store and got the quickest food and water dish available. we never really upgraded until now. Well I love this, it looks very elegant, as far as food/water dishes can look. The one we were using was somewhat small and she was dragging it across the kitchen floor, with this she cant do it, and she loves it! She can easily access her food and water. I love how clean looking they both are, and they dont leave messes all over the place! Its easy for me just to use a papertowel and wipe underneath as well. The assembly was super easy, and I think all of us are completely satisfied.The only thing I would suggest to the seller is take newer better pics between the smaller and the larger dishes for comparison. The pics you have make them look exactly the same size.",dogs,3
"Our elderly Rotty-Lab is very large (160 lbs) and arthritic. Getting in and out of our Volvo Wagon, or our even higher Dodge Caravan, was very difficult for her. Nor was it a simple matter to lift her, as you can imagine.Initially, she would avoid the ramp; if we tried to guide her up it, she would jump off. Our front door has one stone step so we put the ramp here for a few days and she walked up and down it without any problem. We then switched it back to the cars and she used it readily and easily. It is stable, sturdy, has a non-slip surface, and is easy to fold up. We had read the ""squashed finger"" review and were concerned that would be a problem. In fact, we had no problem like that.The only negative is that the folded ramp takes up more space than we would like in the Volvo wagon. It is no problem with the Caravan, however. Given the size and weight of our dog, the fact that the folded ramp is bulky is a problem we're willing to live with--particulary to get such a strong well-made ramp.",dogs,3

Throw in a torn knee ligament which was repaired and I immediately went back to Cosequin. I do think it helped in her post op recovery, and she is back to her old self, playing with her toys, prancing like a pony and lying upside down on the couch looking for belly rubs!",cats,2

No mess! Even smells are kept to a minimum! If your cats are like mine, they like to kick litter around after they take care of business. While a small amount of the litter still manages to find its way out of the front portal, compared to a standard litter box, it is much harder for the cats to kick the litter out of the box, and less litter ends up on the floor.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",cats,2

All of them failed due to pump problems. Finally I found out they sell pumps and went ahead and just bought a new pump. In the pump instructions they provided cleaning instructions for the pump (how to dissemble and clean w/ vinegar and water....this was not in our original instructions at the time). I managed to get all of our previous pumps working! So now I have a huge excess of pumps in case one ever goes out for any other reason.Some other tips",cats,2

"I have six indoor, rescued, adult cats. They all love this toy. And it's a lot of fun for the humans in the house, too! The cats are so intrigued by the swirling, flipping, snaking motions of the toy, the humans end up laughing and giggling just watching them. The cats jump, and flip in the air, and roll around on the floor. It's fun to watch.I don't know how they do it, but the unit is exceptionally well put together. After lots of exuberant use by six cats, it's showing no signs of wear and tear at all. The fabric is super soft, and it's stretchy, too. It's attached to the flexible, apparently UNBREAKABLE wand so well that it shows no sign of detaching from it. Its wand has been stepped on, dragged across the house by various cats, gotten stuck in the weirdest places, and it just keeps bouncing right back.There's another favorite toy we have, thePetstages Catnip Chew Mice. So I took one of those and tied it to the end of the Cat Charmer's fabric, and that's been a big hit with the cats. They like carrying the mouse around--while pulling the entire Cat Charmer along behind them. It's quite a sight.I've bought many cat toys over the decades, but this one truly stands out. I highly recommend it.",cats,2

You don't have to raise the larger door to do maintainance on the cage, I can use the smaller one. If I open the larger door, and stick my hand in their, the bird's tend to fly out.I also found it easy to put together.",birds,0

"What a waste of my money! I bought 2 of these bones for my 2 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (3 years old, 18lbs, toy dogs). The packaging says ""for your power chewers"", ""perfect size for small breed dogs"" and ""thoughtfully designed for toy sized dogs of all ages"". I don't particularly consider these dogs to be ""power chewers"" (my last dog was a bulldog - now THAT'S a power chewer!), but they like to chew, and I would much rather have them chew a toy instead of shoes, stuffed animals, kids toys, etc. I picked this bone because it was a change up (and looked more interesting) than the Nylabones they already have.The ORKA bone is a flat, flexible, blue bone with a hole in one end. The hold has 3 ""streamers"" tied onto it. The streamers are small canvas ribbons with knots in the ends.I gave the bones to my dogs, who were instantly interested, and within minutes I was pulling a loose streamer out of one dogs mouth. One streamer was already gone (to be found later during poop pick up), and I removed the others and threw them away. The dogs seemed to like the bones, so I gave the bones back. They had the bones for about 20 minutes when I took them away to check them out. Well, what I discovered was that one of the bones had already been chewed through at the point of the streamer hole (20 MINUTES!!!) The other bone also showed many signs of chew damage. That was that for the ORKA Bones. Very disappointing.On the bottom of the package it says ""While this product is made of an extremely durable material, no product is indestructible in all cases. As with any product, supervise your pet's use of this toy. Inspect product regularly for rips or tears and remove toy if damaged or if parts become separated, as injusry could result.""In my opinion, an extremely durable material, when being used in the intended manner by the intended breed, should last a LOT longer than 20 minutes.Bottom line - save your pet's health and your money, and don't buy this bone.",dogs,3

The size is good for our small apartment, and it's lightweight and easy to handle, clean, etc. The only negative I've experienced to date is that the metal grates of the cage feel a little flimsy, and the perches that lock in are thus a little wobbly. The doors also can be somewhat noisy when opening which tends to frighten our new bird a bit, but overall we all like the cage.",birds,0

"I just bought another because I lost the first somewhere. I'll find it, I but can't have too many. The puppy LOVES his laser toy and even though he's never caught the red spot, it's still the most exciting toy of all. It doesn't work outdoors in the daytime, so I take him to the basement where the concrete floor won't be damaged by his scrabbling nails and he runs around like a maniac after the light.The cheapo batteries that came with the toy lasted a respectable 5 months with daily use. They can easily be replaced with basic watch batteries.As the days got shorter I would use it with the group at the dog park. Some dogs got it and were zooming around with mine, others just stood there looking puzzled. I don't know why some dogs love it and some don't, the only clue is that the retriever junkie dogs weren't as into it, while the lackadaisical retrievers were nearly foaming at the mouth. None of the dogs care about the fancy shapes, which are dimmer anyway. The brighter spotlight is what works.Remember, if your dog is wrecking things, he's bored. A tired dog is a happy dog.",cats,2

"This toy outlasted 90% of dog toys but still did not survive one full evening of chewing from my boxer and had to be thrown away on the first day.So far the only toy from JW that I have tried that survives heavy chewing from my dog is the MegaLast Bone toy, which I think is a very good value compared to Kong products, which are the only other rubber toys that survive. The MegaLast Bone has lasted months without a rip, tear, or puncture.",dogs,3
"...Meh!I've used this filter for 1.5 years and it's just OK.Pros:Cute decorationWhisper-quietSurprisingly keeps my 40gal tank cleanCons:Waterfall is much too steep for my 9in yellow-bellied slider to climb, so can't be used as a basking areaRequires the water level to be incredibly low, leaving my swimming space (took multiple trips to Lowes to buy planters to place under the filter to increase water level)Cartridges are rather expensiveNeeds to be cleaned and de-gunked very frequentlyOverall, may be great for smaller turtles, but my full-grown turtle needs a filter that will allow ample swimming space, and maybe doesn't need to be cleaned as often.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Mrs. Spudman picked up a bag of this canine treat because it was on sale. I don't think Beggin Strips are much of a deal at any price. Just read the list of ingredients. It's a wheat/corn product with a little bit of bacon and cheese far down on the ingredient list. There was a time when most of the dog treat products were of this low caliber. Today there are far better choices with more wholesome ingredients and even real meat listed first.Beggin Treats are soft and easy to break into small pieces. Our dogs do seem to enjoy this offering, but in the world of dog snacks, this one resides near the bottom of my list, a treat I wouldn't consider no matter the price.",dogs,3
"I purchased two Gentle Leaders back in June. It is now Jan. We have two dogs that are part Shih Tsu and part Bijon. On a leash, they were all over the place, pulling and wandering and getting aggressive with other dogs. With the Gentle Leader, one of them became very docile and manageable. He walks beside us with no pulling or wandering. The other dog takes longer to settle down and pulls a little more. He is more curious and he still wants to wander some but he is much more in control. Both are much more manageable when confronting other dogs. Watch the video and do exactly what it says and you will be amazed in the change in your dog! This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it!!!",dogs,3
"My kitten was growing up-and out! I have a tiny apartment, and we're only allowed one pet, so she wasn't getting enough exercise. The PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball makes her work(out) for her food, and gives her something to do for an extended time. Sometimes, she doesn't even eat it all, so she even eats less. She has slimmed down, and we're both happier! It's very sturdy & well made, easy to fill and adjust, and just what we needed. If it could be adjusted so smaller pieces of food wouldn't fall out so easily, I would give it 5 stars.",cats,2

This is my second seat cover. They work great for smaller sedans. Definately waterproof as my dogs always go down to the river. The only drawback is the seatbelt holders. They are large and will leak and get your seat wet if you do not cover them in some way. I bought a cheap waterproof baby crib protector and put it under the cover where the seat belts go. Works perfectly. They are easy to install and you can throw them right into the washer.,dogs,3

"At about 3 years of age, our cat would have bladder infections several times a year (straining at the litter, staying there for 5 min+ at a time, only a little urine and it was blood-tinged). We had been feeding her only on indoor cat dry food. After many trips to the vet and rounds of antibiotics, I read that some cats with this problem do better on wet food - something to do with not drinking enough water or just not getting enough fluids in general. For the past 4 years, she has not had one bladder infection! Friskies Chicken Dinner in Gravy Special Diet is the only one she likes the taste of.",cats,2

However, somewhere in the description it says they have catnip inside of them, but my cat hasn't responded to it at all. He just likes them to be thrown.",dogs,3

I love this leash system. One of the training techniques used is to tether your dog to yourself - this does that and allows handsfree walking/running for both of you. Definitely add the accessories if you are needing some increase in leash length and a bit of stretch.,dogs,3

"You're not going to notice any change in coat quality or shedding off the bat, as it takes time for your pet to actually absorb and use the nutrients in this product. However, over time, and supplemented by good brushing habbits, your pet's coat will start to regain luster and the shedding will taper off. Of course, you will never ever get rid of shedding 100%, but this product will help get you close. Brushing is the most important part of combatting shedding, so don't expect much if you use linatone without brushing.",cats,2

"I was hoping this product would be a replacement for the messy cardboard cat scratching posts that my cat has liked over the years. I was really surprised to see how small and flimsy the product really was. I actually have an average sized cat, 8lbs. and it wobbles underneath her, there's not much support under the carpet scratching area, so I finally had to use a 3 lbs. weight to weigh down and stabilize the scratching post. Daisy still doesn't use it unless I put her on top of it, even then the scratching post is so small she can only fit half of her body on it. I've tried catnip, toys, etc. but she doesn't really like it. I wouldn't recommend this product, unfortunately, I'll keep looking for a scratching post that she'll love.",cats,2

Update,cats,2
"I have always wondered that if you are a manufacturer and spend all those investment money to manufacture a product, why you don't just spent a little extra time to test your product!! This feeder is one of those products that just do not deliver what they suppose to, because it's clearly not tested in real life condition. First of all the feeder is easy to flip over. I took some time to screw it into a wooden board to make it more stable. But the second problem is even worse. It doesn't take long for a cat (cats are naturally designed to stick their paws into all kinds of holes) to figure out how to get into the the dispenser opening and jiggle it long enough to get the food to come out. I have tried many ways to glue things and devise some king of protection but all failed in the end. Then the timer got out of control and time just kept changing. Resetting it didn't help. I got a new timer from a hardware store but the feeder's motor stopped working soon after. What can I say. Don't spent money on this junk.",cats,2

It would be great if you could open the top and pour water in...my #1 wish for something like this,cats,2
This is the best investment that I have made for my dogs. Before I bought this my dogs didn't seem to be drinking alot of water. Since buying this product they want to drink water all the time!

"The product really does work to hold back my 1.5 year old Weimeranaer (who is VERY headstrong and wild). He throws a fit every few minutes when it is on, however I believe this will subside with time after he gets used to it. I love how it takes very little effort to control him with this collar, and it appears to be comfortable for him, as well. Would recommend this product to anyone that has a wildly hyper dog on their hands for walks. My vet recommended this collar instead of the choker ones or the ones that have the inverted spikes. I had never heard of it before, but I'm so glad she told me about it.",dogs,3

I like the way youcan curve them just the way you want, and I think Friskie does, too. They are well worth the price.",birds,0
"This product does not displace the cat's desire to drink out of the kitchen faucet. The unit makes enough noise to be distracting in a quiet room (not a ""fountain"" noise, but rather a ""motor"" noise.)

Clever idea, but I'd recommend against it.",cats,2

"My yorkies love this toy so much. One loves to pull the balls out, and the other loves to play catch with the balls once they are freed from the cube. This toy was a bit too easy for them to get the balls out (one hard shake and half of them fell out), so I ended up sewing half of the openings closed to make it harder. If you have a dog that is too smart for their own good and loves this type of game, then sewing up some of the openings will make it even better. I love the versatility of the toy in that they can use it as a seek-and-find game or just have a blast playing catch with the balls. I haven't had any trouble with rips or tears yet, but my pups are gentle players and more into games and competition that chewing and shredding. The material doesn't seem like it would stand up to a rough chewer so keep that in mind if your pooch likes to ""kill"" their toys. All in all a fun toy that can be filled up with other small toys if your pup wants to keep digging for more treasures.",dogs,3
"This item is described as ""Guaranteed Indestructible"". My dog loved it but after playing just a few times with it, it is leaking. Really disappointed.

"I bought these because my puppy was not learning housebreaking easily. I figured I could at least save odors and stains on my carpet until she caught on. They do work great as far as holding urine. But they do not keep in stool do to the opening at the base of the tail needed to put the tail through the outside of the diaper. This is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, but there isn't mush you can do since you need an opening for the dog's tail. You can reuse them , if not soiled of course, thanks to the reusable cling tabs. I can't say they are speeding up housebreaking, but they do save my floors from urine in the meantime.",dogs,3

I needed an automatic litterbox because after a horrendous injury to my leg I have had and will need many surgeries and it is impossible at times for me to get out of bed to clean the litterbox and painful the rest of the time. It is easier to find friends to feed the cats only because scooping poop seems to fall out of the duties of friendship. I saw all the great reviews of the Litter Robot and ordered it 1 month ago.I bought the unit in black and it looks hi tech. This is truly a great product and has made my life so much easier.It is easy to assemble and the noise is minimal. I have 2 cats and I change the bag 2-3 times per week but the drawer would hold an entire week. The maker recommends 13 gallon trash bags but I prefer plastic litter box liners(jumbo size).There are only 2 problems with the unit. One is that odor does come out of the drawer thru the little holes but I totally solved that problem by putting a Renuzit Super Odor Killer in the drawer. The second problem is that due to the height and design when the cat comes out cat litter is strewn all around from his paws much more than with a regular covered litterbox so I suggest you keep a dustbuster next to it.Despite these small problems I intend to have one of these units for the rest of my life!,cats,2

"I've used Prime for the past 15 years on every fish and shrimp I've kept. It is by far the best on the market, and the most affordable. There may be conditioners that cost less, but consider that normally you need one cap full for every 10 gallons. With Prime, you need one cap full for every 50 gallons or so! For big tank owners, that means I can do a 50% water change on my 120-gallon and use 6ml of Prime vs 30ml of any other product. Even the smallest bottle (100ml) will treat 1,000 gallons!I've read some complaints here of the smell, and it does have a sulphur-like smell. The smell is NOT transferred to the water, and of course goes away when you cap the bottle.This is the only conditioner I'll ever use... it is effective, safe for even my most delicate ornamental shrimp, and by far the most cost-effective product on the market.",fish aquatic pets,4

This product solved the scratching issue immediately. The only improvements I would add would be to mattify the plastic so that it is less obvious and to make them a little wider so that they can be wrapped around the corners of the furniture for wider coverage and further deter side scratching.

"I have a vacuum designed especially for homes with pets, and for PET hair, it does pretty well. For HUMAN hair, it has a much harder time and despite cleaning the roller after each vacuuming session, I've had to replace the roller and the belt three times. My hair is almost down to my waist and my stepdaughter can sit on her hair and we both shed a LOT of hair. I think we shed more than the cats, actually.I was looking for something that would get up as much hair as possible off the carpet prior to vacuuming it, read the reviews, and ordered The Universal Rug Rake. I haven't had any problems with the height of the handle (I'm 5'7"") and the handle hasn't collapsed on me during use, although I do tighten it before each use so maybe that's why. Using short, quick strokes and working in a grid pattern, it is both impressive and a little scary how much hair this thing gets up. We did a 3x3 section of carpet in the hallway outside the bathroom - we had to clean out the rake twice. I didn't realize how much hair was left behind after vacuuming. I also noticed that it did a very nice job of fluffing up the carpet, and it's made getting some of the deep down dirt that gets imbedded into the lowest part of the carpet fibers much easier to get up. The rug rake has been great for getting up all the junk that clogs my vacuum, and I use it daily to keep the carpets looking fresh. It's made vacuuming quicker and more efficient, because I'm no longer stopping to clean the roller, and there's no more burnt hair smell lingering in the air after I'm done. (gross, I know)All in all, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and have already recommended this product to friends.",dogs,3

This leash could have been shipped in a bubble bag but instead came in a 14"" X 20"" X 4"" carton filled with 20 air bags.

I first started them off on Wellness hard food but for some reason it gave one of my cats diarrhea. (He does have IBS flare ups at times) I wanted to stick with the natural lines so I tried Blue Buffalo next and it was a great fit! All three of my cats get this hard food and they enjoy it.,cats,2
I just gave this Kong to my dog several minutes ago and I can already tell that it's money well spent. It hasn't left his mouth since we gave it to him! I put some of the pepperoni Kong paste inside and he thinks its the best thing ever. He is a 17 pound standard Dachshund puppy (Weiner Dog) so this size works great for now but he will soon grow out of it. I will be sure to buy one of these toys when he does! Only complaint is that he likes to squish all of the paste out of the toy and smear it into the carpet. It is worth the mess though if it makes him this happy.,dogs,3

"My 3 American Indian dogs are picky about what they will eat; especially the youngest who is just over a year old. We leave their dry food out for them so they can eat when they want, but the youngest just won't eat enough. When this food arrived I gave him a handful and he chowed down like it was a treat. He is eating and loving it! Highly recommend this food if your dogs are the picky kind. The small size is great for my oldest dog who is just over 17 years old. She often has trouble with other brands because they are too tough or too big for her to eat....she's lost a few teeth. She too is picky and now loving this food.I like the fact that it is primarily chicken. We, as a family, eat mostly chicken and rice; nice that they get the same thing in a way that is better for them to eat.Overall a great product!",dogs,3
"This ramp is a great combination of durability, weight and ease of use. As I'm starting to get older I wanted to be able to get my dogs in and out of an SUV without needing assistance from me - particularly when they get older. We just added a new Chocolate Lab to the household and wanted to start her off on using the Ramp when young. It took about 5 minutes to have here going up and down the ramp. Surprisingly, it was about the same for our 12 year old 80 pound mixed breed.I like the rubber treads, they are durable and give the dogs sure footing. I thought about the carpeted ramps, but after a while they would be difficult to clean. The ramps that have a sandpaper type finish seem like they tear easily. This solves both problems.It terms of weight, it's not the lightest ramp, but then again, it's not the heaviest either.The length seems about perfect for my Mercury Mariner. The ramp is not too steep and would probably be good even on a higher vehicle.It is a bit bulky, but I cannot imagine any similar product being much better.",dogs,3
I live in the desert and have had no problems with the springs or handle. My puppy likes to poop in the rocks. The poop patrol does not like the rocks and I usually end up with more rocks then poop. That's really my only complaint.,dogs,3
"Got the litter box about 3 weeks ago and our 3 cats took to it within 2-3 days. They say with one cat it'll last 30 days and from my experience with 3 cats (I can stretch it about 10 days), that is right in line with their claims.I don't know what kind of mega-whizzing-craptastic cats these people with one cat who say it only lasts one week have... If this wont last for one week with a single cat, you better bring em to a vet. I have one small cat, one large one, and an old one that pees all the time and the cartridge handles them easily for a week plus.The crystals really do a great job of capturing the smell -- just mix em up every couple days to spread out any uneven wetness spots (like if your cat prefers using one corner).The only downside is the cost.. $45 a month is pretty high to maintain the box for 3 cats. Planning on trying out one of the ""forever"" refillable litter trays with my own bag of Fresh Step crystals.UPDATE 12/28/07 -- With 3 cats, I can go a full two weeks, product still awesome.. The metal tines are beginning to rust however due to sitting in wet pee from time to time.",cats,2

"This product has changed the way I feel about litter boxes. I keep it right next to our box at home. You just open the lid, scoop and deposit into the litter locker, The scented liner cartridges seal out unwanted odors. just 1/4 turn is all it takes and your refill will last quite a long time. Very easy to empty just open, cut liner with attached cutter tie it in a knot and toss it in garbage. (you dont even have to handle the bag full of used litter). I have one cat and generally have to empty the locker every two weeks.",cats,2
"It took mme a while for me to figure out that a litter box must be available with higher walls and thus, would stop a lot of this kitty litter from getting around the room. (NOTE",cats,2
"This is my dog's favorite toy. The rings are edible and not the least bit ""bad"" for him. The Busy Buddy was actually recommended to us by his trainer since he's a ""strong chewer"", and she was right!

I have a mixed breed dog with soft straight fur. This is the first brush I found that combs out a lot of hair. Her coat looks and feels great. This tool has a quality feel and can be had for a fraction of the retail price on Amazon. I don't know how it got poor reviews. I can only imagine it pulls the hair on dogs with curly hair/fur or that its was used too hard or too often.,cats,2

"Living on Maui, I am used to the fact that many times I am forced to pay higher prices for certain retail items purchased locally. One good example of this is pet supplies for our Holland Lop rabbit; at the local pet store on the island, I was shelling out $14.99 for the 3200 cubic inch package of Kaytee Aspen Bedding. Several months ago, I realized that I could purchase this same product on amazon.com for $9.43 (and, since I am a member of the Amazon Prime program, there was no additional charge for shipping & handling).Just the other day I came across the 8.0 cubic foot package of Kaytee Aspen Bedding on amazon.com for $21.99 - this is a huge savings for me over anything I could find locally, and I am thrilled to be able to save so much on this product! In addition, due to the large size & weight of the product, not only is shipping free, but amazon.com sends it out to me by UPS, so I get it within 2 days.My only complaint (and this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that the bedding was not sealed in any kind of plastic wrapping, but simply in brown packaging paper. It's not as secure as the plastic wrapping might be, and as you can see from the photo I uploaded, there is a small rip in the package....and the bedding is starting to make a mess everywhere. I would recommend plastic packaging for this type of product in the future.UPDATE as of September 2012",small animals,5
"My younger dog has gotten bored lately, and chewing anything she can get ahold of in our shed. I went out last night in an attempt to find something that will keep her occupied. For $20 I bought this, took it home and had hope for about 7 minutes. She got the treat out, and I messed up by pushing it in too hard, and getting it stuck in between the 2 sides. (In theory, this was the most amount of time the toy went without having the treat popped out.) After she licked at that for a while, I was able to push the treat out and get it back to the place that it belonged. Pop. Pop. Pop. She is now a pro treat grabber, who can get these everlasting discs out within 3 seconds flat. 2 if you don't count the time she sniffed at it. Now I have a $20 ball to play fetch with.",dogs,3
"The title says it all! It's a nice looking scratching post that you can leave out in your living room or family room even when guests are over.

"How much easier can you get? The automatic litter box works like always, it just dumps into a bag rather than the plastic container. I have 3 cats and I was constantly emptying the plastic container. Not only did it get expensive, it got messy. This is so much easier! The mess goes into a bag. You twist the bag, tie it off and cut it from the rest. You knot the bottom of the next bag. I don't have to touch messy litter. My cats are happy. I'm happy. Piece of cake!",cats,2
"I bought the Super Concentrate to help break down the contents of the Dooley even more and hopefully help eliminate more of the odor.

"My cat loves it and he's REALLY hard to please with his water. I thought it was pretty expensive for a water bowl, but it's been worth it for us. He used to beg (loudly) for ""fresh"" water all day long. (His idea of ""fresh"" was our decorative fountain, the fish tank, the toilet, the hot water from the bathtub or some immediately from the sink! I figured out that he really likes movement to his water. When I slowly stirred the water in his old dish, he would drink it. This gives me days of peace until it needs to be cleaned. I use distilled water so that it won't breakdown with minerals, but I have to remember to always have some on hand.",cats,2

It doesn't pull out the hair that's attached...like some other brushes I've tried. Cadie and Duke just love the attention. Sometimes makes me wish I was the dog! It seems pretty comfortable to hold while I'm brushing them out. I usually spend about 20 minutes or so brushing each one.",dogs,3

There are a lot fancier and newer styles out there, but they're expensive and the one I bought, at least, is easily gotten rid of by any savvy cat.As for putting harnesses on fat cats; well, naturally they're not going to fit right. Don't feed the cat carbs (i.e. dry food; or use grain-free dry food along with canned food), you'll get him/her to lose weight, and that'll solve your problem. And the cat's problem.",cats,2

"I bought the Bumble ball for our 16 pound dog for Christmas. I have no complaints about how the ball works or the quality of construction. But the dog only looks at it as a curiosity such as a cat looks at a gold fish in a fish bowl. The ball is hard and really has no good way for a small dog grab it. She prefers her stuffed toys and balls.I am glad I tried it, but the toy is better suited for a larger dog. Seems like a cat may enjoy it more but again the size may be a limitation.",dogs,3
"I purchased the CitiKitty about 2 years ago when one of my cats was 2 years old and the other was about 6 months old. I got really tired of smelling a litter box so I decided to try this out and see how it worked. The process at first is a little messy with the cats flinging the litter on the floor when they scratch and stuff like that, but in the end, it is totally worth it. The whole process took about 2 months since we were taking our time and training 2 cats at once. Also, one of my cats was a little slower to warming up to pooping in the toilet (he was fine with peeing, however) but eventually he was able to do it just fine and after removing the training seat completely I never had any problems. I cannot tell you how happy I was to be rid of litter, the litter box, and the litter box SMELL.So it has been about two years since I finished successfully training both of my cats to use the toilet, but I am writing now because just a few months ago the younger of my two cats passed away from internal issues he had had since he was a kitten. I adopted another cat just recently and since I am not pleased about having to use litter again, I am getting ready to toilet train this one as well! I am hoping this time around will be just as successful as the last!",cats,2

I use them as a reward and an incentive. They are just the right size, not to big and not too small. These crunchy little treats are little signals that something is about to happen. I use them when I leave the house, I use them when I come home. When it is time to go to bed or time to come for a walk. These are their favorite treats and I feel good about giving them something that is healthy.",dogs,3

"After the second Litter Maid broke in a couple of years, I bought Litter Robot. My cat used to pee up against the Litter Maid rake, which made a mess every time. No problems with the Litter Robot. And it does look like the Death Star. It isn't silent, but is rarely noticeable. The original one had a defective board, which was replaced by customer service in mere days.There is no smell. Trash bags work fine. Hardest part was leaving the broken Litter Maid to fill up so the choice was between the nasty Litter Maid and the clean Litter Robot. It took 3 days to convince the cat.Just don't tell anybody in the office you spent $300 on a litter box. You may never hear the end of it.

"If your Cats are bored with their old scratching posts--this is the scratcher for them! I have 3 Siamese, and they were all estactic over this, when I surprised them with it as their Christmas present, 2 years ago. They have had numerous Kitty toys that amuses for a day or 2, then never looked at again. This wonderful scratcher is used daily by all 3. Mei-ling, my naughty kitty, absolutely loves to shred the corrugated interior, then pull the loose pieces out with her teeth, and smacks the ball around so fast, it occasionally will come out of the track. Sometimes there is quite a mess, but better the Turbo scratcher, than furniture or drapes. Refills are easily obtainable, and I am having to refill quite frequently. Meitu, my old kitty, loves to scratch and knead it while taking her naps, and occasionally will bat the ball. Suki-hana, the princess, was declawed before I adopted her, and entertains the other 2 kittys, that will watch intently as she attempts to sharpen her claws. (Do not declaw your kitty, it isn't right) This wonderful item is not only a scratcher, but entertaining as a toy, and occasionally will substitute for a bed!! To add extra fun--Catnip can be sprinkled on the corragated scratcher interior. I am purchasing another Bergen Cat toy today, as I have definitely been delighted with my first purchase.",cats,2
"After reading the other reviews, I thought this was going to be a great toy for my puppy.... IT ISN'T! It curly 'hairs' pull out of the animal with the simplest tug!

"I have an almost 3 year old Saint Bernard that has chronic, disgusting skin issues. He does pulse rounds of antibiotics for chronic infections, has severe allergies, and even the dermatologist has issues getting him regulated. I had noticed that he was chewing on his back again and licking his front legs, and had called in a refill of antibiotics to preemptively start so it wouldn't become a raging infection again, but had also recently purchased these. I figured no time like the present since his skin was gross anyway. After 2 days on these, I didn't need the antibiotics. His coat is healthy, he's about 80% less itchy, and the staining on his skin where he licks is slowly disappearing. I could not be happier with this product. Even better, it hasn't upset his already sensitive stomach. Definitely something I am going to keep him on! He's been on it a month, and there are no regrets!",cats,2

To avoid having him kick out of my arms and undo what the surgery had fixed, I looked around and found this product. It has made carrying him up and down stairs so much easier as I can just carry him like a briefcase. The only complaint I have, which is geared more towards my dog, is that he sometimes steps out of the front straps and almost took a nasty spill as a result. Now, I just check the straps before I lift him.",dogs,3
"We have a german shepherd puppy who has learned that the sound of her bark gets our attention so she barks all night every night. Which is really special. and super annoying. Especially since we live in an apartment complex and are trying our best not to irritate the neighbors below us. Of course we didn't want to shock her she's only 15 weeks, but we needed something. We just put the bark collar on her and 3 barks later we have a perfectly happy puppy who no longer barks. Plus she's now a walking OFF can as citronella repels bugs. Best investment we've ever made. Not sure how long it will last so if it doesn't I'll write an update. As of now - we are thrilled.",dogs,3
"I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats. Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the ""rope,"" which didn't take long to tear in half. I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea. He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any! So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong. He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp. In less than 24 hours this toy was in pieces and in the trash. It was definitely NOT worth the almost $20 I spent on it!",dogs,3

"This tray is really quite wonderful. It has removed the need for me to tape down puppy pads, and it seems to help my puppy with understanding her ""boundaries"" by giving her a little edge to try to not step over when pottying. (Notice I said ""try""... it's not fool proof.)I ordered the small, because the price appealed to me and the size dimensions seemed appropriate. I have a 4.5 month old Miniature Pinscher, about 5.5 pounds, and it is too small for her. She tends to wander while going #2, and this isn't quite big enough for her wandering needs. If you have a puppy about this size or bigger, or one that likes to wander, go ahead and fork over the extra couple of dollars for the ""Regular"" sized tray.Other pros",dogs,3

"The description says the door has a 4 way locking feature. The problem is the lock which requires the collar magnet only works one way. The other lock is a manual slide lock. The 4 way locking feature gives you the following options:-Unlocked both ways-Locked both ways-Unlocked to go out, collar magnet required to get in-Locked to go out, collar magnet required to get in(Notice that the collar magnet is only required to get in the house, so any animal can get out).I have 2 perisan cats and a Yorkie. I only wanted the yorkie to be able to go out so I installed the door backwards.It took the Yorkie a few days to get the hang of getting out as she has to hold her head down low (otherwise the magnet won't unlatch the door) and push the door open at just the right time (magnet only unlatches the door for about a second).Last night my worst fears came true, I saw 2 racoons outside....Now I have to lock the door via the manual slide lock at night which means nothing can get in, not even my yorkie. She can get out using her collar magnet, but then she's stuck outside.Overall the door is great but I feel the locking feature should be described more clearly. I bought this door so I would not have to wake up at night to take my yorkie out, and now that's what I'm doing.",cats,2

"I have a Beagle, a Cocker, and a Dacshund mix. The medium works for the first two and the small is perfect for the little guy.Postive:My dog would eat so fast that I was sure he never chewed. All three dogs eat at the same time and the Beagle would always finish first and then pressure the others for thier food. This caused the Cocker to eat a little faster too. I am glad I saw these on a TV show recently. They work!!My Beagle has slowed down considerably. He HAS to slow down just to get to all the bits around the center prongs. I hope it keeps working. We have been using it for 2 weeks and I just ordered more for my niece to use with her 3 dogs.Needs Improvement:The bowls need to be weighted down. They are too light. With the dog having to move his nose around the prongs, it moves the bowl more than a standard bowl. Adding some weight would help.My dad is working on a raised platform to use with the bowls. That will give the benefit of feeding the dogs at their best level AND holding the bowls in place on the stand.I highly recommend these to anyone with dogs who eat so fast that they regurge thier food as soon as they are done.",cats,2

This resulted in a gross, soggy dog food mess every time the dog ate. This resulted in my wife cleaning the mat just about every day and complaining to me about it, which led to her complaining about why I never did anything. So I go online, read some reviews and bought this product. When it arrived she rolled her eyes and asked why I always buy &#34;crap like this&#34;. But since buying this the dog seems happier, there's no more soggy kibble and no more mess to clean up on a daily basis. About the worst mess he now makes is occasionally drops a nugget or two. Did I ever get a 'thank you', or a 'you were right, this was a great idea'? No, no I did not. But I would like to thank Ethical Pet Products for making this great product.",dogs,3
"I was skeptical at first, but when I found a great price for this product on Amazon, I gave it a try. We cleaned our house very well before we tried the Furminator on our dog and cat. After using the product for two days we began to notice the house had less hair from our pets shedding their coats. We have only had a minimal amount of hair to deal with. My allergies have greatly improved. I recomend using this products on pets with shedding issues.",cats,2
"I had a chewman toy years ago for my goldens, and remembered it as being the one toy they consistently played with. We have a new puppy in the house, and chewman continues to be a winner. Not quite sure what it is about this toy, but as soon as we showed it to our 12 week old retriever mix, he grabbed it in his mouth and walked around the house with it. Not only does he like to carry it around, including up and down the stairs, but it lives up to its name, and chewing on it he regularly does. A week after purchase, with daily use, it still looks as good as the day it arrived.Contrary to some negative comments from others about the squeaker causing dogs to destroy the toy in an attempt to look for it, when my pup discovered the squeak, he was delighted, and continues to take delight ever time the toy makes a noise. Also, chewman has been through the washing machine, and has come out looking as good as new. Highly recommend.",dogs,3
"For the price I could not make one myself and have the quality of this Hammock. I had no problem adjusting it to fit the back seat of my 2008 Dodge Ram Quad Cab. By making the adjustments for the back headrests snug, and then adjusting the front loops over the front headrests it was just as the picture shows. I have two Brittany adult hunting dogs and they love it also because they ride in style and never slip off the seat onto the floor board. I leave mine attatched to the back headrests and just fold it for passengers when needed. The material is resistant to dog hair sticking to it unlike the appolstry of my truck and a small wisk broom cleans it of any dirt deposits right out the door.",dogs,3

"My cat has been getting sick from hairballs every few days over the past months. The vet advised brushing and hairball control food.I couldn't get near him (the cat not the vet) with a regular brush without fear of serious scratches. Hairball control food wasn't working much either.The mitten is heaven sent. He loves being ""stroked"" by it and it removes any old/ loose fur. I simply couldn't believe the amount of hair it removed the first couple of times i tried it.",dogs,3
"I have found this product, the medium, or 1-inch, size of the Premier Nite Lite Glow-in-the-dark Dog Collar, to be both hard to find and worth it.We bought a pink one of these about five years ago, and about three years ago it started to fall apart. Specifically, the strip of reflective material sewn to the nylon webbing gradually lost more and more chunks of itself. A chip fell off here, another triangle got rubbed off during wrestling, a third piece broke away on a walk. As of a week ago it had lost a good 50% of the length of that crucial strip that makes this collar special, which is why I tried to buy another one. And which is also why I subtract one star.Yes, even though I know a new one will deteriorate just as fast as the old one, I decided to buy another one a week ago. The reason is that I have not been able to find any dog collar on the market, whether on Amazon or anywhere else on the Internet or in a pet store, that is nearly as good as this one at highlighting my all-black dog in the dark.The strip is both photoluminescent and retroreflective, facts the Amazon description doesn't make clear. That it is photoluminescent means it will absorb photons of light and then emit them, which is useless in daylight but pretty handy in the dark. The effect is surprisingly powerful, at least to me. If you expose the strip to a 100-watt bulb up close (the intensity of electromagnetic waves such as light falls off with the SQUARE of the distance, so the closer the better) for, say, ten seconds and then observe it in a darkened room or just outdoors at night or during a total solar eclipse, you will see a quite distinct emission of light. It is literally bright enough to read a newspaper by.The retroreflective pieces, which are incorporated on the same strip, also work quite well. The ingenious thing about retroreflective material is that it reflects incident light to almost any angle, so whether those headlights are hitting the collar square to its surface or from way behind or in front, that light will be reflected in almost every direction. Have someone shine a flashlight on the collar while you observe it from various angles and you'll see that it stands out brightly, even in early dusk and late dawn.Contrary to the experience of a previous reviewer, the strip on the collar I received a few days ago does cover the entire collar except for a couple inches near each buckle half.Finding the manufacturer's Web site of little use, I phoned them on November 4, 2011, and in that 13-minute conversation I was assured that they do not sell the product under review. The woman said they might have in the past but do not any longer.Consequently I ordered a backup, in a different color, yesterday.",dogs,3

The double doors give you set up options based on your room.",dogs,3

He's pretty food motivated so I do not know whether he will discriminate against any kind of food. It does leave my baby with stinky breath but nothing a breath freshner dental chew can't solve. I will feed my puppy Wellness for the rest of his life, if he continues to like it, which I hope he does.",dogs,3

"This is one of the most useful things I have bought for my dogs and my car. Not only are the dogs kept contained and safe, but my seats won't get scratched, dog hair doesn't get all over the car, and they can't smudge up the windows. It fits just right across the back seat and straps in place. I didn't buy the optional pads that fit it, but you don't really need them because the material is strong enough to protect your seats. If you want to though, you can just throw an old blanket in there for your dog(s) to lay on. I have a pug and a boston terrier and there is more than enough room in there for the both of them. It folds down flat and zips shut so when you don't need it, you can collapse it down and store it in your trunk and it won't take up any room at all. As the other reviewer wrote, the mesh sides ARE a little dark, but they are breathable and do not cause any problem at all for me or my dogs. I'd recommend this product to anyone who asks, it will really save your car.",dogs,3
Why didn't I purchase this sooner? Between my Rottweiler and myself (very long hair that gets stuck in the vacuum cleaner's brush) this rubber broom has been a real help in cleaning ANY surface in my house as well as outside.

So when my boyfriend bought this collar, I didn't think it was going to work. But when I finally got up the nerve to try it, I was pleasantly surprised. No more pulling and feeling like he was going to wind up choking himself. It was an immediate improvement; I was walking him instead of him walking me. I would definitely recommend this collar to anyone who struggles to walk their big dogs.",dogs,3

"I have an 80 lb husky/lab mix who is quite a power chewer, plus he has separation anxiety. He doesn't like hard toys like Nylabone, and he has no interest in the $20 Kong that is appropriate for his size/strength. Played with it for a few days and then never looked at it again.This ball was fantastic, we were able to stuff it with treats and leave him without him running to the door whining, but about a month in he has been able to start tearing at the treat holes. We had put a squeaker in it from a squeaky toy, and I think that just sent him in overdrive to get it out... It seemed like the perfect indestructible squeaker toy. I just took the squeakers out and I'm hoping we can get some more life out of it now that he won't be trying to get those out. We'll see. Overall, it lasted much longer than any other toy that he has shown interest in.",dogs,3
"We have an Australian Cattle Dog/Border Collie mix. (VERY high energy)He is food motivated, but also gets ""worked up"" to a point of crazy.This toy, besides being indestructible, has taught him to slow down and work patiently for his treats/food.

"It took my dog a couple of days to like this toy. At first she wanted nothing to do with it but now it is her favorite. She discovered that if she shakes the stump, the squirrels fly out, so no more digging around inside. She loves to grab the stump and shake it (being part terrier, it is very vigorous shaking indeed). The squirrels are all missing their faces now, but still well loved and squeaked when found. We are quite amazed at how much our dog loves this toy and my husband keeps telling me what a good choice I made. The nieces and nephews were hoping the dog wouldn't like it and I'd give it to them instead... The kids thought it was the greatest thing.",dogs,3

"This item is absolutely dangerous to use on your dog. The prongs have sharp edges that will cut into the neck of your dog. All the ones I have seen at Petsmart and other places have prongs that are smooth and rounded and will not cut into the neck of the dog. They give you vinyl caps to cover the prongs as an option. These caps are thin and cheaply made and if used, I feel will break off leaving the sharp prongs exposed.If you care about your dog, I would tell you this is NOT something I would use. Cheap price. Cheap product. Made in China. You get what you pay for.I would definitely NOT recommend this product.I have requested to return this item to Amazon, who gave me a prompt refund and even told me to just keep the item!

"I Bought the standard one first for my three cats. It was great, but soon I realized that the cats resented the shrinking of the size of the litter box (previous one had more interior space), they started to throw the litter out. Also, I had to clean it several times a day (VERY picky cats).I got the bigger one and problem solved. Period. I'm sending the standard size one to my mom, she has 2 cats, and I think the box will be enough for them. As for 3 cats, it's asking too much for the standard one.I Had them sent to Chile. Veeeery expensive management of the box, the delivery, customs, etc, but entirely worthy. I don't have to scoop anymore, I hated that. Easy to clean, no need to touch anything but the container... great.",cats,2
"I purchased this product trying to save a litte bit of money. I would not recommend this for any dog. I bought these for 4 small dogs under 6 lbs. They are not durable. The plastic is thin. Having purchased 4 to begin with with in the last year all are cracked. They do not stand up to the test of time. Maybe for a light weight cat, rabbit or small rodent this may work. I am now back in the process of purchasing 4 new durable kennels that will last. Update, having read the reviews on the Petmate Vari Kennel, Small, Bleached Linen I have decided to purchased 2 of these kennels. It has been over six months and they have held up quite nicely. In fact I am purchasing two more. Hint, save your money and buy the better kennel to begin with. I wish I would have!",dogs,3

I liked how well it spread the shampoo throughout his short, thick coat.",cats,2

We'll see if this works in the long term.I don't notice a problem with them 'sudsing up' as some reviews say. So far so good.",cats,2

When I received this product it was very easy to pop open and I put her blanket in and she climbed right in without hesitating and would not get out. It is the perfect size and she can stand up, poof & get comfortable with no problem. She is 4lbs fully grown and fits perfectly in it. Love It!!!!",dogs,3
"Size is 13"" x 13"" at the top, a little smaller on the bottom, 25"" tall. It easily fit a 40 lb bag of large-breed Diamond-brand food with room to spare. Then I added about 4 lbs of left-over puppy food. That was a tight fit but the top still screwed on. Size is perfect. slim dimensions mean it tucks into the corner of the closet.Lid snaps on securely and includes heavy duty rubber gasket, doubt the top would come off even if tipped over. Screw top lid makes for easy access.",cats,2

"We bought this so we could automatically feed our cat breakfast without having her bug us at 4am, which she was accustomed to doing. So far it has worked very well. I took the advice of other reviewers and removed the label from the lid, as it was already coming loose when the feeder arrived, so it wouldn't jam up the works. Our cat has not been able to cheat the system and advance the food on her own. The feeder does make a loud whirring noise when it goes off, but it is brief. I would recommend this feeder.",cats,2
"The product works great. We have seen a noticeable difference in a short period of time. We have a dog who was abused and bites when she is nervous. We were having a hard time keeping her eyes clean, now it is so much easier because they don't get all caked. She's happy and we are too.",dogs,3

"We have tried this collar and the Tri tronics bark collar for small dogs, and the Petsafe collar is smaller and seems to be more comfortable on our 3 small dogs. The other thing we like about the Petsafe collar is that it is self-adjusting, so if your dog barks once and the first mild shock doesn't correct the barking, it automatically increases the intensity of the shock. The intensity of the Tri tronics collar needs to be manually adjusted by you. Both are good products, but the Petsafe collar works better for us and our mini dachshunds & Papillion.",dogs,3
"It arrived OPEN..in it's original packaging. Box was literally one tear away from falling apart. It looked as if the box had been dragged across the truck and ground a dozen times or more. Amazon MUST take into consideration who they use to ship items like these crates. These crates are NOT cheap. Crates are also very delicate and this one could have been broken in half upon delivery. It was left in front of my home, open, for all to see. No instructions inside. The product should have been stored in another box with padding and properly sealed for delivery. I guess free shipping does not cover the safe and secure delivery of Amazon products. I've written Amazon for a credit. I will call if I don't hear back soon. I am afraid to return it and order another one. It may arrive in worse condition. Shame on you Amazon! You are better than this!

"We've had one of these for years and I've looked all over locally at the many shops in the SF Bay Area and they all told us they were discontinued. I'm delighted to see they're available on Amazon.My wife and I are continually borrowing this from each other to do different cats. Our kitties are long-haired Persians and they shed, get slop in their fur, and generally do what kitties do in their day's work.Even though their fur is long, it's thin, and larger combs don't do a good job. Standard flea combs pull their fur and generate some ill will and extract fur that would have been happy to stay attached to the cat.This comb glides through the fur, removes loose fur and mats, assorted food leftovers and debris, and the cats actually seem to enjoy it.I don't use it to catch fleas. Our indoor cats don't have fleas, and if they did I'd try one of the vet-approved single-drop methods. Combing out the fleas doesn't remove the eggs and if the fleas can't bite the animal they'll bite you instead. At least that's how it used to happen to me when I had indoor/outdoor cats.I just ordered two in case one gets misplaced or broken.",dogs,3

However, she wanted to have nothing to do with this product, it was literally IMPOSSIBLE to get it on her. Not to mention it seemed way too small, I know I never got it on her to be for certain and I understand it needs to be well fitted so it doesn't slip off and they can't easily pull it off, but it seemed rather unreasonably small. Very disappointed, dunno how I'm going to take my bird outside this summer, really don't want to clip her wings, seems abusive to me, but this product seemed worse.",birds,0

I attempted to follow the instructions about training the dog by listening for the tone and pulling the dog back into the yard, etc. The only problem was I could not hear the tone at all. My hearing isn't what it used to be so I went to get the teenage kids. They could barely hear the tone when it was turned all the way up. We finally had to train our dog by turning the collar over and watching for the red light. It definitely made the training more difficult and resulted in our dog getting shocked a few more times than would have been ideal.Our dog can be stubborn and after a week or two, she decided to bolt in the front yard. Up to this point, we had the unit on the lowest shock setting. After that we turned up the shock to the second level and she got a surprise when she tried it again. She no longer is interested in trying to run so I must admit that the upper level will alert even stubborn dogs. She is now staying in the yard safely.It seems a small thing to put a louder or more audible speaker in this. There are ways around training but it definitely makes it harder. I do like the low profile of the collar which is why I selected this unit.",dogs,3
"I bought this as an additional media to add to my Aquaclear media baskets and was very happy when I received it. It was a lot thicker than I anticipated, but that is not an issue. I will be using it in my Aquaclear 70 and Aquaclear 50, and love that I can cut it to size for each model. I will be able to get many changes out of this one roll of filter pad.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I think this spray smells really nice. I actually like spraying it around the house because it leaves a nice herby fragrance. However, I haven't noticed that my cats pay any attention to it whatsoever. I was using it to try to prevent the cats scratching on my couches. The couches smell nice now, but the cats are still scratching. It is a bit expensive to use as a fragrance spray or I would keep buying it to spray around the house just for the scent, but change cat behavior it does not.I was also having problems with my one cat spraying his territory in the house. He is an anxious sort. He has the most obsessive love for my daughter and me, and also feels that the house and all its contents are constantly in jeopardy of being claimed by another cat. He sometimes loses his marbles and sprays directly ON me, by the door, my side of the bed, and my daughter's bedroom furniture. This calming spray does nothing to help with that, but the cat attract cat litter certainly helps cut down on that behavior. It is expensive, but I have had a lot of success with it. I hope that helps some of you that have a similar possessive feline at home. Since I got the litter, he mostly just rubs his face against my daughter and me, which we like. He can mark us as his property that way anytime he wants. The spraying right on me and near our beds, not so much.So, like I said, this is a lovely product as far as smell and ease of use, but I think I would only buy it at a lower cost to use as an air freshener, not buy it at a higher price for what is supposedly does but doesn't do.",cats,2
Then use these pads! I just opened them last night and came down this morning to a nice puddle on the kitchen floor (underneath the pad). (My dog is four pounds.) I'm going to have to use two pads on top of each other from now on.There is a reason they're cheap...,dogs,3

"I bought this litter box for my cat a month ago, she uses it fine and I think its a great box. It is VERY large so just be prepared for that. And really the only thing I don't like about it is that the lid doesn't latch onto the bottom half of the box... it kind of just sits on top. Other than that, its a very good product-it keeps the litter contained and makes the litter box less of an eyesore.",cats,2
"Wish I had found this stuff a long time ago. I hike all winter with my Aussie and she struggles with the snow in her paws. This stuff smells good, is not messy at all. Although it must be re-applied on the trail as it does not last all day - it is a must for my dog now.",cats,2

"The feeder is a well-made battery operated item that automatically opens when the pet is to be fed. It is easy to operate and once it is set, nothing more has to be donr. To refill the compartments, all you do is push a button. The feeder can be set for 6,12, and 24 hour feedings. I have had other feeders before that cost more, but this is the best one I have found for the price.",cats,2
"I bought this feeder (after researching many, many products...none of which met my specs) so that my cat would have food on a slow, steady, regular schedule. My cat has a sensitive stomach so he would often scarf his food and immediately throw it up. This had been the bane of my existence for years. Until now. Now he gets fed the same tiny amount of food every 2 hours, He's a healthy kitty and I'm able to leave the house.Two main selling points for me:1) It dispenses only the small amount of food that my cat can handle (you could put in a lot more food if you wished.)2) I can set it for any time of day, in any increments.Fortunately my cat has not figured out how to forward the tray and hopefully it will stay that way. I do wish there was a small sound or bell when the tray rotates. True the rotation is a little noisy itself but sometimes that isn't quite loud enough if my cat is in another room, napping, etc. Also, I don't think it is complicated to set the clock at all. Fairly clear instructions are included.Btw, I liked it so much that I bought a second one a month later.",cats,2
Recieved item and with some difficulty finally got it on my dog. I put in on him during normal weather as suggested. He just froze up. Would not come to me so took it off. It started to rain lightly a few days later so I put in on him. It did not help at all.A total waset of money.,dogs,3

After two months with the buns, the ball is still quite intact with a few holes where she decided she needed a snack!",bunny rabbit central,1
"It doesn't always go off when the dogs bark, but I can push the button on the top after telling the dogs to stop barking and that sets it off. It seems to have helped us be able to control the incessant barking phases they used to get into. They'd start barking and then kind of fuel each other to keep the bark fest going. We used to be able to yell, squirt them, threaten them, try to bribe them (with treats) and nothing would affect the barking spree. This seems to help stop it.",dogs,3

The double doors are awesome, although since my puppy is still small, I can only use one door right now due to where the divider is placed. Only downside is the crate folds easily, but I can't carry it well for transport. However, it's to be expected since I have an XL, and I'd rather have a sturdy and durable crate that I can't carry vs. a flimsy one that I can. Love my new pup and our new crate!",dogs,3

"I've been a loyal Frontline user for five or six years and have never had a problem with fleas on my cats. I recently placed my order through Amazon for the first time because the price was better than the one given at my vet's office. I was SO DISAPPOINTED. My cats, for the first time ever, were crawling with fleas. Because they weren't getting better, I reapplied the treatment two weeks later - still the same. They were EVERYWHERE. I could even see them crawling on top of the application area a few hours after I had applied it. In the past when I have used Frontline, I've literally watched fleas drop dead and fall off my cat, but this time, it didn't even touch them.I called Frontline to complain, and they told me I wasn't vacuuming my house often enough, and the larvae must be burrowing in my floors. Well, I have concrete floors, and I'm interested to know how flea larvae are going to burrow into my concrete? When I told the customer service rep this was the first time this had happened with their product, and I explained I had been a loyal Frontline user for years, he pretty much blew me off and told me there was nothing he could do for me. Oh, after he suggested I treat my yard.My vet suggested I switch to Advantage, and I did. IMMEDIATELY, the fleas were gone. She (the vet) said she's heard multiple complaints about Frontline being ineffective over the past few years.I'm really disappointed in Frontline, and in their customer service. I would be happy to give the product another shot if they had offered to refund my money or replace the bum box I received, but they did neither of those things, and instead tried to pin the problem on my lack of housekeeping skills.My cats are now happy and flea-free thanks to Advantage (which is cheaper! yay!), and I will never use Frontline again. It's funny, because I used to think Frontline was a superior product to Advantage, and I happily shelled out more money for it. Not anymore.",cats,2
"I have tried several water bottles, I feel it is right for me to say that compared to the large amount of water bottles containers for rodents, this is far the best in quality, it's very, very easy to clean, there's less chance for the water to contaminate. If by any reason debri grows in the bottle (which so far it hasn't) with a bottle brush you can get to every corner of the inside bottle, you won't miss a spot due to the 'top off' system. Not to mention it holds really well on the cage, it also has a mesh inside the top part of the bottle's top!",bunny rabbit central,1

I have purchased a number of these sand perches because I have always used these. Unfortunately I have discovered that these are just plastic perches with some king of grit glued on - certainly not the original product. Do not buy these as they are not good for your birds - no better than those cardboard gritty things. I dis use some wet sandpaper to bring down the sharpness a bit because I did not want to damage the underside of the bird's feet.,birds,0
"I was pretty excited to find a nice quality dog bed for relatively little cost. I have two big dogs (85lbs and 70lbs) and beds for them were prohibitively expensive. I had a heckuva time putting the beds together by myself. I simply wasn't strong enough nor did I enough hands to pull, stretch, hold in place and screw the pieces together. But in the end, that was for the best because once I got my husband to help me put them together, they have proven to be high quality, durable beds. Two years later, the beds are still in good shape. And my labs stand on them, jump on them and scratch on them while rolling around and doing whatever it is they do at night. In the summer, the dogs are nice and cool cuz they're up off the floor and air can circulate under them. In the winter I throw a blanket on the bed for a little extra warmth. Looks like we might need to get new covers someday, but they're only about $11 apiece, which is still cheaper than what I would have spent on most other beds. So get a buddy to help put it together and your dog will love you for it.",cats,2

"This is a great product if you have algae in a planted tank and do not have CO2 injection. It provides CO2 for the live plants and melts some kind of algea including the nasty ""black beard"" algae.

What I did was since I had already thrown away my old bottles, I got a set of measuring spoons and use them only for this purpose.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I purchased one of these hoofers at my local PetCo and my small (16lb) dog loves it. The picture doesn't show it that well, but is is the whole hoof of a bovine, the toes with the bones and meat and skin all there. It is dried and not cured, which I am really pleased with.It doesn't smell bad like sometimes just the clipped hoof can, and infact even when my dog has been chewing on it for a long time I don't notice it being smelly. I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad from the curing chemicals but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides. If you have a big dog you may want to monitor them since it does have the toe bones inside and they are small.",dogs,3

We have a 100 LB American Bulldog so we usually have a hard time finding his size in stores and dog boutiques who cater to little toy dogs.

I didn't want to get anything that would hurt my dog (choke harness, prong collar) so this seemed like the best choice.I put it on my 86 pound Pit and it doesn't fit him well and it did NOT stop his pulling.The way it's supposed to work is by appyling pressure to the chest and therefore discourage pulling. My dog doesn't even feel the pressure so this defeats the whole purpose.He is a very muscular dog",dogs,3
"This product seemed like a great deal, so I gave it a chance. They're OK. The dog liked them well enough, but she's not very fussy. On the downside, there's very little actual rawhide, and they simply don't last long. I won't buy these again.",dogs,3
My poor year-old terrier tore pieces of this toy apart in a few minutes and ingested a few of the tiny fragments. A few hours later she vomited for half of the night - at least 12-14 times.

"These pads hold large amounts of liquid and do not shred when our cats try to ""cover up"" their messes. We are using these pads for our older cats even though they have ample access to litter boxes, sometimes they don't make it for whatever reason. Since we've started using these wherever we think they might have an accident, they choose the pads instead, which has saved our carpets from the urine they we all know never comes out. We also use them if the large dog we have is kept inside for long periods of time. She just automatically went on them. We've tried the cheaper kinds but they shred or don't hold as much. Now we buy these in bulk.",dogs,3

Bought this for my 30 and 12 lb dogs. Cutting the pills in half/quarter and giving less according to their weights is easy and a good way to save money. This is a safe way to prevent a flea infestation as the drug is not present on my dogs' coat where I could pick it up while petting them. Any fleas they may pick up from the environment will be self-limiting as no eggs can develop and are relatively easy to catch with a comb or a bath.,dogs,3

We have tried him on many foods - from prescription diet to vet recommended foods, and until this food, he turned his nose up at pretty much all of them, so much to the point that he lost over 10 lbs in a very short amount of time. I was literally at my wit's end over it. Then I saw this food at a local pet store and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I have tried several flavors of the Natural Balance foods with my cat and so far he as eaten them all without any hesitation or problem. I highly recommend this food!",cats,2

My Maine Coon is 3 ft long and 24 lbs solid muscle with big teeth. I love it when the vet expects you to shove a pill down his throat. It aint happening! The cat has heart issues at 10 yrs old and needs his pills to stay alive. He loves these treats and when I put the pills inside them with one hand and hand it to him with the other he readily gobbles it up. The fact that they are so mushy and pliable make the pill stick to it even when he chews. Never touch the pocket with the hand you handled pill with. Cats will smell it and wont eat the pocket and will remember for a few days. These things are a life saver.,cats,2

OH and even though my dog only weighs 20 pounds, I got the medium-large one for dogs up to 77 pounds. I feel it adds more strength and it is NOT that thick and the handle fits my hand perfectly. I would definitely recommend getting this size even if you have a small dog.

"My parakeet is very picky and I was happy to get the food that was discontinued at our local store. However, the bag came with a hole in it and since the box had been mishandled as well (large hole in the box), some seed was missing. It would have been a very good idea to wrap the seed bag in another bag prior to shipping. Very bad packaging job.",birds,0

I want to rub my face against his fur!",cats,2
"We've been using toys like this for a couple of years now - they're all wonderful, and Da Bird is no exception. Just like you can see in the customer pictures, cats will leap, flip, charge, sneak, ambush and kill the feathers on the featherstick with total abandon. And it IS total, so be careful where you play with it - your cats won't be beyond leaping into the air and coming down hard on something that'll hurt them.For indoor cats especially, this toy is truly invaluable. Exercise and hunting are great for stress relief and health for kitties, and Da Bird is a wonderful way to give them both - by the time our kitty's chased this thing down for a few minutes, she's gasping for breath and well exercised. It's not just a toy, it's a healthy work-out for your indoor kitty!When you buy it, though, make sure to pick up some spare feathers - after the feathers have endured too much abuse, they just won't fly and flutter the way they did new, and although our cat still likes them they don't excite and captivate her the way fresh feathers will. New feathers transform it into a whole new toy, though.Highly recommended for anyone who likes to play with their cat; and doubly, for anyone who wants to give their indoor cats a good run-around and some great exercise.",cats,2
"I have two cats - one was adopted - his previous owners had declawed him - and one was bought because I was looking for a specific personality to keep my current cat company. The new guy came complete with claws - and as I think declawing is terribly barbaric - I refuse to inflict that upon Merlin (the new kitty)...Basic specs - Merlin is an 8 month old Ragdoll - and already bigger than my current cat, who is a large built cat. I wasn't sure what size Soft Claws to get for Merlin, but guestimated a large because his breed is among the largest domesticated breeds I believe. Full grown he could approach close to 20 pounds, without being overweight.So I got the Soft Claws in the mail today and applied them to Merlin's claws. I was a little worried that he might put up a fight - but, apart from some very minor squirming - he sat still and let me glue each claw cover on, and then once both front paws were done, I held him for another 5 or so minutes to be sure the glue had set. The first couple of hours he spent trying to groom the nail covers off (between trips to the food dish, and batting around cat toys), but he's adjusting to them rather quickly! It was so easy to do, and I'm very excited by the fact that I won't be getting any more 1 am wake-up calls to the sound of Merlin using the corner of my bed as a scratching post! He may still paw at it.. but there will be no more scratching and digging in of his claws to rip away at bed spreads :-)For anyone with cats that like to scratch where they shouldn't - I highly highly recommend this product!!",cats,2

I woke up... she was chewing! Yummy stuff, apparently, and she had a lot of fun with it. Izzie the bunbun approves. Five stars from us!",bunny rabbit central,1
"I have been using this product for a few months and love it to death. The fountain is very effective and quiet. The filter works great (it shows visible signs of usage) and it's nice to know my cat's water is relatively clean. The product does what it is designed to do and provides an encouraging water source for your cat, though mine still enjoys the occasional faucet lick.The design of this thing is great too. The entire unit is so simple and comes apart so easily and is a breeze to clean. One thing that bugs me is not the device itself, but all the people reviewing the product claiming that the reservoir is difficult to fill without spilling. I find absolutely no issue with this and am perplexed at people who are unable to cleanly refill their reservoir. Yes, the unit is not leak proof as the valve operates on a float lever, but it's JUST LIKE HANDLING A WATER COOLER JUG. IT WILL LEAK IF YOU HOLD IT UPSIDE DOWN, THE TRICK IS YOU DON'T HOLD IT UPSIDE DOWN UNTIL YOU'RE AT THE UNIT. Aimed right, you make no spill at all.Overall it's a wonderful product worth every penny.",cats,2
The Magnadoor is the only pet door to purchase which does a great job of closing after the pet uses the door. It will stay closed unless you get an awfully strong wind. It is the best product to keep out flies and other pests. Plus you can lock it when you are on vacation. Many of the other doors just have a soft floppy door which doesn't really close and keep out bugs.,dogs,3
"I really, really like this litter box and apparently my two kitties do too! I'm so glad to be rid of the old box. This does a good job in keeping the litter from being tracked. I use a Dustbuster every few days to clean the steps and a very small amount from the floor. Titanium color works well in our space and I like the matching scoop. An added attraction is my younger cat (9 mos) thinks it is a great hiding place when I lift the lid and set it on the floor while I scoop! I always see her tail sticking out of the opening. She comes running when it is scoop time! A good, well-made product.",cats,2

"We have three dogs, and fleas have never been a problem until this year. We were told at our local PetSmart that there was a type of flea in our area that was resistant to most flea applications. The salesperson recommended Advantage or Frontline. I ordered the Advantage from Amazon and it arrived a few days later. Within a couple of days of applying the Advantage we couldn't find any fleas on any of the 3 dogs. It cost a lot less to order from Amazon than my vet would have charged, and worked just as well.",dogs,3

"Item purchased for full size truck (2012 Ram Dodge 1500 Laramie) back seat which is actually split, not bench. However one side is like 2/3 and other 1/3 of seat, so it is like a bench. The larger side of the seat is fully covered by this purchased cover. Straps go over/around the headrests and hold the product up just fine.If it is supposed to fit a FULL bench, as the picture seems to indicate, then it must be in a tiny S10 truck or something. There is just enough of the fabric/product to cover the 2/3 size side of the rear seat set up that our truck has.I put the shiny side up, so as to be able to wipe the hair off easier and even have it blow out the window when the window is open. Otherwise with the Moleskin like fabric up, I know the hair would stick and become matted and yucky, at least in my opinion. Putting it down also allows the cover to ""stick"" better to the leather back seat, rather then slick side down where I am fairly sure it would slide around under the dogs feet etc...Overall very happy with the product. We use a harness on the seatbelt for our Cardigan Welsh Corgi so he is limited to the one side of the seat which has the cover on it, thus no problem with the product not covering the entire width (side to side) of the truck back seat. The back and seat portions of the seat are fully covered by the product without question.",dogs,3

"My dog was doing fine at first and would eat all his food when I set it down. I had used a football shaped dispenser before and he did really good. I don't think he likes the orange ball as much because, yes it is a lot of work and I think he gets discouraged or bored after 20 minutes. He doesn't even bother getting all the food out, he just gives up. Especially when there are a few 4-5 pieces inside that I can't even get out easily he just leaves it there. Sometimes he will practically leave half his food in there. He began letting the ball just sit there and lingering over it. Now he just walks away from his food after one bite. I think he is disinterested in the ball, maybe my dog is lazy. But then I tried walking him then setting his food in the food bowl and he still did the same thing, he didn't eat it up like he used to. So I don't know if the ball made him take a step back in learning/training or if he's just not interested in food anymore. But the ball definitely made him start to just let the food sit there and I think it's because he thinks the food will be there whenever he wants it so he's gonna eat it when he feels like it not when I say he should be eating. I don't think that behavior is right and he used to always eat when I said it was time to eat.",dogs,3

"The furminator removes far more hair than any other brush, comb, or rake that I have tried.

It doesn't eliminate shedding but it definitely cuts down on it. I know friends who use it on their cats, and if your cat enjoys being brushed, then this is a good tool for them too.",cats,2

"I purchased this trainer about 1 month ago to reduce the barking of my 2 male Maltese dogs. These dogs are known to bark to alert owners, but my one little guy (6 lbs.) barks incessantly at everything. I think it is a fearful bark, but I've tried other methods that didn't work and didn't want to use a shock collar. My other Maltese (9 lbs.) barks continuously in the yard, but only if he hears something. I read many reviews on this product before purchasing it on Amazon.com, and most of the reviews were positive.I first used it in a situation where they were both barking and would not stop after a verbal correction alone. When used, both of them appeared startled and did stop barking (so it definitely interrupted the behavior). It has shown to be an effective deterrent to interrupt the behavior, but as I've read- you need to pair ir with a verbal command of what you don't want (I say ""Quiet"", or you can use ""No"" if it is some other behavior you want to extinguish/reduce).The only negative I can see is that if you have more than one dog and only one dog is exhibiting the behavior you want to change, you can't just aim the trainer at that dog for only them to hear. For example, when my little dog was barking nonstop (but the other wasn't), I used the trainer and verbal command with him. However, my other dog became fearful and hid under the table. Now he slouches and hides even when he sees it. But overall, the quantity of barking has decreased as they both now stop even upon just seeing the device. I still use the verbal command ""Quiet"" (I've heard that one word commands are best) even if just pointing the device. Hence, my 4/5 star rating is only related to having multiple dogs in a family. Their ears are highly sensitive and I feel it's unfair to subject all dogs to the correction unnecessarily. But the Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer has proven to be effective so far, and now I don't feel badly b/c I only have to show it to them (w/verbal command) and they stop the barking.",dogs,3

"I originally got the Litter Kwitter because that was the only one available at the pet store. It was very well made but did not have many opening options. My cat couldn't go from 0-50% opening.So I looked online and saw this product. I liked that it had perforated widths. I had another cat that I had toilet trained and the kit was similar to this one. He trained in a weekend. This kitty is going on 6 weeks. She did not like graduating from 0-50% and started to pee on the floor and poop in the tub. When I got this product, she took to it very well. I let her get used to each opening for about 2 weeks. It's nice that it has an additional seat. I've had to use it when she wasn't comfortable with the current opening. I keep the second seat one opening less than the one she is on. It's also nice because you can put the toilet seat down onto it and it doesn't lay awkwardly. My only complaint is that the perforations are hard to pop through. You pretty much need scissors cause if you try and pop it out you could split the plastic, like I did. I guess it's necessary because you don't want kitty to be surprised when the hole starts to rip at the seams.Good luck on toilet training.",cats,2

"I bought this product for my cat. She was in the right range for application. Weight, age, healthy.The day after application she became lethargic, but not to the point that it was anything immediately of concern. In retrospect was what caused me to realize this poison was taking affect and it wasn't her just being an easy going lounge about.The day after that she got worse and I called the 800 emergency number on the back of the package because of the hour and my Veterinarian's office was closed.""Oh, don't worry this product doesn't absorb into her bloodstream."" The Sergeant's product adviser assured me. ""Just take a cloth with some warm water and soap on it and wipe the area where you applied the topical application and she should be fine."" They continued.I asked how long it would take to see an affect. Not long, she promised. Just a couple hours or so.I stayed up with my cat all night long. Her symptoms growing worse, her body becoming more relaxed and pliable so that she couldn't hardly stand by the time I got to my Veterinarian's office in an emergency appointment.""But of course it penetrates the bloodstream!"" The Doctor said. ""How else is it going to kill the flea that bites your cat and drinks her blood?""Of course! I knew that. It made perfect sense. A, ""no duh!"" moment. And yet the night before when I heard that Sergeant'sadviser assure me that wasn't the case the terribly panicked weeping cat lover in me wanted to believe she would overcome.The Vet re-hydrated her with fluids, gave her a shot of something I can't recall, and said if she was going to rebound those treatments would do it before the end of the day. Otherwise, she'd crossed the threshold and there was no going back. Yes, I could have had him put her down right there. But to think I took away her chance at bounding back with all that Doctor assistance and kicked her leg's out when she was clearly fighting to survive for those two days, just wasn't in me.So we went home together.Cinnamon lost her bladder while laying on her favorite cuddle blanket reposed on my tummy in our living room. Her friend cat's had been let into the house, as if they knew this was a goodbye at the moment we arrived back from the Doctors office, as they stood at the door while I was unlocking it and bound their way past my legs and to her favorite chair.As I write this I can still hear Cinnamon's weak mewing as she turned watery blue eyes toward me and repeated her mews over and over until they faded to rasping. As if asking why mommy? Why does it feel so bad?And then she passed away.I called Sergeant's and told them what happened. Ignorantly I thought they'd care. They did to the point that they asked me to have my Vet send them a copy of my bill. Half of which they promised to pay for my loss. Sure enough a check came after that for half the expense of adding more money to what I thought was an inexpensive and safe way to help my cat combat flea's, cost my cat her life. And along with that check was a release that I had to sign in order to cash the check. Promising to never sue or be part of a class action against Sergeant's et all, in future.I took that to mean they knew full well the potential for continuing to make what I learned after all this, was a chronic problem with their pet flea treatment poisons.And that's what it is. Ask your own Veterinarian about Sergeant's or even Hartz pet flea product ingredients and you'll hear for yourself what a risk it is. A known risk that has cost countless animals their lives. All to the knowledge of those companies. And not always to we the consumer. Until now. And reviews like this.If someone had stopped me in that store aisle and said, don't buy that or you could lose your cat! I'd have walked away and my precious Cinnamon would be alive today. As it is, when I see someone in a store aisle considering a purchase of this or Hartz product, be it for cat's or dog's, as those have their tragic statistics as well, I do warn that person through sharing my experience.It's like anything in the human pharmaceutical industry. Calculated gain vs. calculated risk. If the company stands to make more money in sales than they do in liability payout for a given product, they go for it.Forewarned is forearmed. If you love your pet DO NOT BUY THIS POISON! IF you like to gamble and you do buy it contrary to all the one star warning, and it would be no star if the Amazon system would allow it,you stand the chance of watching your own pet die slowly and painfully. As their nervous system and body functions slowly degrade.Had I gotten Cinnamon to a Vet an hour after applying this garbage to her, she could have been saved. Could have. No guarantee.Do a keyword search beyond these warnings and see for yourself. The horror stories about this garbage are rampant. I know now. I didn't before. ""Sergeants flea toxins"". As just one keywords suggestion. Or, ""Pet deaths sergeants (or Hartz) flea product"". You'll learn the primary ingredient is hazardous. A toxin. No, not just to fleas.The more expensive flea treatments are worth the price. Because chances are they won't cost your pet their life. But do the research on those as well. Be aware. Saving money means nothing when you can't save your pet's life for the side effects you've just caused them to suffer because you're on a budget.Rest in peace my precious Cinnamon. If our story can save someone else from losing their precious four legged family member, it will help me to survive my responsibility for using this product on you unawares of the risk I was putting you in. And if there is an afterlife and a God, perhaps we'll meet again and I will cuddle you while weeping tears of joy for having a second chance to say I love you and I'm sorry.",cats,2

"I was a little worried by the negative reviews I read of this product, but I went ahead and gave it a shot. Weeks later now, and it's the best purchase I've ever made for my dog!The ball does have a strong chemical odor when you first get it, but it fades quickly. With kibble inside, it was no turn-off for my dog. You cannot open it, so don't put messy treats inside--I just put my dog's kibble in it, and wash the outside from time to time, and it's perfectly clean. The material it's made of is relatively soft, which is both good and bad--good because that means it's kind to my furniture and hardwood floors, and not too noisy, but bad because it's no match for a chewing dog. Luckily my girl is not a chewer, but if you have a dog who likes to chew you will want to supervise him/her with this toy. Also, it's way trickier to get kibble out than it looks, and the only reliable way to get it all is to just keep rolling it and rolling it. If your dog is lazy, none too smart, or prone to frustration, maybe reconsider getting this toy. If you have an ADD herder or other smart, active dog, this toy is a godsend.That said, my dog absolutely adores it. It took her a few minutes to 'get' it, but after that it was pure love. The little craters on the ball make it easy to grip so your dog can easily carry it around, and its bright color makes it easy to find if your dog misplaces it (say, under a bed). My dog actually prefers this ball to her bowl at meal times! She ditches her bowl, with food in it, if she sees me get this ball. If you have a smart dog who could use some more interest in his life, you will LOVE this ball. As an added bonus, your company will be very entertained by your dog playing with this toy--it's adorable.",dogs,3
"My vet recommended this product for my dog's itchy skin. It works, and I even bought some for my sister's dog, too. I highly recommend it if your dog is itchy.

"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable. For now I will keep looking for a similar product but with better workmanship. Fail.",dogs,3
"Well, um, how to say this. This toy is beautifully made. It is super quality. I fostered a litter of kittens with a box similar to this one (but not as nice) and they went nuts. So I bought this recently and my old kitty and younger kitty weren't interested. The younger kitty was the mom of the kittens. So, my neighbors adopted a new cat, not a kitten, and I gave this box to them for their new Lizzie. She spent most of her time under a big chair except at night, when she would come out and play by herself while the couple slept. The next morning after Lizzie got this box, all the toys that had been in it, plus the treats, were out of the box. She ate the treats, of course, and my neighbors put the toys back in the box. Next morning, repeat above, etc. etc. So it really depends on the cat(s). I would not hesitate to get this box again. The workmanship is superb, holes the right size, get some of the extras you can put in it or use your own toys, and don't forget the treats. If you have a cat, you KNOW that cats do only what they want to do. They will either love this or not use it. Kittens will always love it. I miss my little foster kittens. They grow up fast and go to new homes and I never hear about them again. Sigh.",cats,2
"Great Disc. I first found the Gumabone Frisbee, - and Nylabone - Frisbee back in 1990, the Gumabone disc is super super tough with more than decent flight abilitlies. The disc is pliable enough to be rolled up, chomped on, tug-of-war etc for years of use before it is time to get a new one. I have owned several (6+) over the years and finally have worn one out, the others got lost -ah- removed from my yard w/o permission- before they showed signs of wear. The disc I am replaceing today had a couple of years with my sheapard-collie mix and then then with my Boston and the last four years with my Boston and her daughter. These two are rough tough Tazmainian Devils, they hang from it, play tug-of-war endlessly, it is their water bowl at the park and the food bowl at home. I guess even a blind dog would fetch his own food bowl? I do not suggest anyone use a Nylabone disc, they are as hard as flint, they hurt to throw, they hurt to catch, let the rim get a little scuffed - ""Frisbee Hair"" and it turns into weapon. Painful and dangerous IMHO.",dogs,3

"I gave this 4 stars because of the scent of it. It has a very strong mint/peppery smell that will linger in the water of your tank and hangs around in the air. I love that this bottle has a measuring cap on it that makes it handy to ensure I have measured out the correct dose. Other than the smell it is a great product! My only concern is that they recommend you treat the tank for 7 days without any active carbon and if you have high waste producing fish like goldfish that is not an option. I can usually go about 12 hours without active carbon before my fish start to show signs of ammonia distress. Since I cannot go an entire week minus active carbon I will only treat my main tank if I have several fish in need of it and salt did not help. Everyday I will pull out the active carbon for 5 hours then replace it and repeat until my fish are healed or for the max of 7 days. If I have a single fish that needs to be treated a hopsital tank is a must, or in my house hospital bucket (in case if I need to transport my fish). In the smaller hospital tank it is possible to go without active carbon if you do a water change everyday (20-30%).This is great for fin rot or any wounds on fish, but I highly recommend adding salt to your tank(if it's a freshwater tank for goldfish, etc) first before adding any chemical med. to the tank. Salt works wonders on fish, just make sure you use aquairium salt and not TABLE SALT.Also if your having fungus issues (cottony growth on the gills or around the face or on the fins) the fungus has to be coming from somewhere if you have an established tank. Clean all the hoses, gravel, decorations and filter, espically if it's a HOB (Hang-on-back of tank).Vinegar is a good, natural cleaner that will not hurt your fish if there is any residue after rising. Usually the cause of fungus is uneaten decaying food and decaying waste in the tank.",fish aquatic pets,4

"First, it looks elegant on my Papillon/Pomeranean who is very vocal when she's not comfortable. The velcro straps line up easily when putting the coat on, the fit is secure, doesn't unsnap like other brands AND there are no &#34;sharp&#34; corners at the edges that can irritate her skin or cause abrasions. Putting the coat on is quick and comfy for her and for me. Shoulda gotten the same thing for my pug & shih-tzu. This coat is a 5 out of 5 stars.",dogs,3
"Wonderful for a cat who needed a bit of portion control & who was begging/meowing so much that it was really irritating his owner (i.e. me). After a few futile attempts to move the dispensing carousel or scratch the thing open, my cat gave up & simply shows up to a chair beside the machine about an hour before it will dispense & quietly & patiently waits. Or if he happens to forget, he'll jumps for joy as soon as he hears that whirring sound indicating a new meal is ready. The cat no longer begs me for food (yay!) and I can tell he likes regularity of being fed at exactly the same time every day, so wonderful for both of us. Easy to program as well. Perhaps a little bulkier than some would like, but I highly recommended it.",cats,2

"I have a 17+ year old female Maltese that weighs 9.5 lbs(she's a little taller and longer than the breed standard). I originally bought the small based on weight and size but they were too big for her. The x-small ended up being the best fit and these work well for her.When she urinates in the diaper, the wet is away from her body (either due to the design or due to the bunching of the material between her legs). If she hasn't wet her diaper, the velcro-like tabs are easy to undo and redo so I can let her outside and it will last 1-2 days if she doesn't wet in it.Recently I bought a package of ""Out!"" diapers because they were cheaper and had more in a pack, but I had two issues with those. 1. The tabs are sticky tabs so even if your dog doesn't wet the diaper, you can only undo and redo the tabs a couple of times before the stickiness is gone. So if you initially close the tab and they're too tight and you have to adjust, you will only have 1-2 more times to redo tabs. 2. The material around the hole for the tail is like a cheap paper so if you need to stick two fingers through the hole to grab the tail to pull through, you will stretch out the tail hole. You have to be careful because the material will rip easily. They do have cute blue and purple dog bones on them though.Overall, the Simple Solution is the best and I found a 30 pack of plain white x-small on Amazon.com from Entirely Pets that was priced like getting 6 free compared to the usual price for a dozen at PetSmart. My Maltese has some dementia and that's what is causing her to pee inside and sometimes step in it. These Simple Solution diapers have not only helped her but they've helped my husband's sanity and allowed me to relax a little so I don't have to watch her constantly to make sure she's not doing business on the floor or allow me to sleep better at night without worrying that she's going to pee in our bed every time she changes positions and wakes me (which she hasn't peed in our bed but I always WORRY that she will so I sleep lightly). She doesn't mind wearing them at all and doesn't try to get out of them.

I'm a tall guy with long arms, but to scoop the very last of the food out of bottom of this thing is pretty cumbersome unless you take the whole top off - not really an issue, just the only ""negative"" thing I could think of.I've owned this for over a year at this point and have had no repeat issues with anything stealing our dog's food!I'm happy to have it!",cats,2

"This gel would be ideal if it were a little thicker and not quite so expensive. I have three cats who all have the feline herpes virus, and I used to use another product and would just put it on their feet and they lick it off, but the manufacturer changed that formulation so I tried Viralys gel. Like I said, if they made it thicker, I could easily slather it on my cats and dispense it to them that way. It's good that this gel is transparent--that way it doesn't stain the carpet if they shake it off. I put a quarter-sized dab on their hindquarters and then they lick it. I recently purchased the L-Lysine powder, for humans (it's a quarter the price of the pet variety) and sprinkle it on their wet food. The downside of using this is that now the cats don't like dry food, and I hate wet food--it's smelly, messy and gives them bad breath. Well, they have to have Lysine somehow so sacrifices have to be made. Again, this gel is pretty good, but too expensive if you have more than one cat and they need to be dosed twice a day.",cats,2

"Wow! That is my first word of this review and my first thought when it arrived. Huge amount of bedding and such a low cost too! I will try and break it down for the rest of my review below -Packaging and ArrivalThis bedding (8.0 cubic inches) came in a pretty big box and was wrapped with a thick plastic. There was a hole about an inch in diameter, but the bedding did not fall out; however, I will say that since it was in a box, it wouldn't have been a big deal if a little had fallen out. So, A+ for packaging!TextureThe texture of this bedding is very fine, although there were some bigger chunks - no biggie, I just picked them out as they weren't hard to find. There may be sharp pieces, but seriously this is not an issue as most wood-based beddings will have this. Plus, I was able to grab a handful and squeeze without slicing my hand, so yes - nicely shaved.OdorThis bedding has virtually no odor, just a slight wood scent but nothing major. It actually smells nicer than those scented beddings! As far as odor control for the animal, I cannot say this yet since I just received and added it to the hamster tank today - but I will update after the first cleaning!Hamster Approval?My Winter White dwarf hamster went absolutely NUTS when I placed her back inside. She started digging like crazy through every inch of that tank and she immediately started making her sleeping area. The fact that this bedding is wood shavings and not a paper-based bedding does not seem to matter. I do add a little Kaytee Clean and Cozy to the mix though, to give her extra softness for her to sleep in.Overall, this bedding so far has exceeded my expectations! I usually get Carefresh for the main areas of the tank and for $50 or more, you get 1/4 of the amount of bedding compared to this Kaytee Aspen bedding. Just amazing.In conclusion, if you are thinking of getting a safe, wood-based alternative - I would recommend this bedding because it truly is an excellent amount for such a small price!",small animals,5

"This is a GREAT dog toy. My dog has had it for almost a year now, and it has survived lots of chewing, tug-of-war games, and general doggy love. I am very impressed with the quality of the product, especially considering that most other stuffed animals have lost their stuffing within a few months (if not weeks) with my dog. We have only just started seeing the barest of thin spots on the platypus's bill, which gets a lot of stress from chewing and tugging.Admittedly, our dog does not use the platypus for its real intended purpose--he has never been keen on digging out the eggs from the pouch in the stomach--but he loves the platypus so much otherwise that we'll buy the same toy once the original finally needs to be put to bed. And the eggs are fun toys in and of themselves; our dog likes the squeakers in them and we play fetch with them inside the house. Our dog has gotten so much enjoyment out of this toy that I feel it was well worth the money.",dogs,3

"I am a big fan of treats that are digestable. I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog. I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.I'm unsure what exactly about this product is ""healthy"", and would argue against it being ""edible"". Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove. But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration. And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.",dogs,3

So this bag of SOFT, PLIABLE, green strands went really fast. I will definitely be buying it again. That it is hand cleaned, selecting only the best edible hay is obvious when the bag arrives and is opened. It smells good and fresh too!",bunny rabbit central,1

"I was literally at my wits end trying to figure out what do do about my litter situation. I'd tried all kinds of different litters before I came to the realization that it might not be the litter so much as the cat box I was using. I love the filters in the top and the locking top! This box keeps litter out of my floor and odors out of my house. I use it in conjunction with Tidy Cats- Multiple Cats litter and I actually invited someone to sniff out the box today, haha. They were absolutely amazed that they couldn't detect even the faintest smell. You can't even smell the scent of the litter! I would highly recommend this box to anyone with a cat!",cats,2
"This product is ok but the biggest complaint I have is that the stainless steel bowls are very thin and lightweight causing them to move around and make noise when my dog eats. The bowls do not fit securely in place. I bought two, one is a 2 quart diner and my dog is clearly not thrilled with the bowl banging around. If a heavier bowl were used that would solve the problem. The 1 quart bowls are the same low quality and I'm disappointed about this. The stand itself is ok, we'll see how long it lasts. I wasn't intending to have to buy another set of bowls but meal time is supposed to be pleasant for them and the clanking and moving around of the bowls is annoying for them. Not sure I would buy this product again unless bowls were upgraded. I have three dogs but won't buy another of this type.",cats,2

Even with the chintzy velcro tie as tight as it could be cinched, the belt was hanging loose. I have 3 Afghans and the jacket was swimming on my chunky one. Aside from size problems, I did not feel there was much quality here for the money. Sent it back and got the usual top notch service from Amazon in the return process.",dogs,3
"I must note that there have been updates since I purchased my unit 2 years ago. I have multiple cats and multiple litter boxes. One cat took to it without any problem, another started using the toilet, one won't use it and the fourth took a while but got there. Their customer support for this unit is fantastic - I know because I have had to call them numerous times. It has jammed, refused to flush, refused to fill - at one point they determined that the motor was faulty and sent a replacement overnight. It may sound like I don't like it, but I actually do. It is expensive to maintain because of the granules and sanisolution smart cartridges. It would be nice if stores carried them so that you didn't have to pay postage on top of the cost of the actual product.",cats,2
"We have a Border Terrier and he was litter trained by the breeder. It works out great!!Pros:1) It is very convenient, especially during bad weather or long work daysCons:1) The litter can be messy2) If the dog poops in it, it smells horrible3) Our puppy has had a few occasions when he missed the litter boxAlso it has been hard to train our puppy to go to the bathroom outside. He is so use to the litter box that he will actually ""hold it"" until we go back in the house and than go in his litter box.Although we've had a few mishaps we have no regrets!! If you have a small dog or puppy I would definitely recommend this!",dogs,3

"The product description page left some information to be desired and I had to do a quick search:Exterior Dimensions 23""x14.5""x11.75""Interior Dimensions 21""x 14""x11""Pros:Nice sizeExcellent constructionDurableDoor opens smoothlyCons:Plastic latchesNo compartments along the top for leash storageThe handle is uncomfortableDoor mechanism could rustI bought this for my 5.5lb Yorkshire Terrier and it works great, he's a bit on the short side but tall enough he wouldn't fit in the smaller kennel. He's got enough room to move around in it comfortably. It looks just like the picture, just a different color, sky blue.It is of a good durable plastic construction, it has a smooth raised floor on the interior but it has a trough along the edges of the interior. I guess it's so if the animal eliminates inside it it can pool somewhere. This could be a good or bad thing. My dog hasn't wet in it yet so I'm not sure.The plastic dial latches work easily although I am skeptical of whether or not they will last as long as the bolts other carriers use. It does have holes for the hardware for ""extra security"" as the brochure states. Also, the handle is a bit uncomfortable because the plastic is a bit rough and pokes/ digs at your hand. The door opens nice and smooth although the plastic casing on the front of the door doesn't extend to cover the backside of the door, which may allow the door mechanism to rust.Recommend for pets up to 11"" tall.",dogs,3
"The fountain works great, keeps the water clean, easy to clean and maintain. However, the filter is problematic in that a lot of charcoal makes its way into the water. So you have to change the water more often than necessary. But my cats love it.",cats,2
I have been using this product for about two years. I have a cat that ocassionally will use the lawn as his litterbox. This product is great for covering up those brown urine spots green.

"It was a struggle to walk my 35 lb dog. She pulled on her leash the entire time. It was like resisting a 35 lb weight for the entire walk. With gentle leader, it's a pleasure to walk her.

"I have a 7 pound cat and this litter box is all his own. I've had it now for 3 months. First I used it without the hood. The cat became enfatuated with the scooper and the workings and kept the machine running every 20 minutes. After 15 days, the poop odor became unbearable though I didn't smell any urine. To stop the cat from playing with the scooper, I added the hood. It worked. The motor sound attracts the cat but the hood made it difficult for him to yank it when it stops moving. To better control the odor, I have added some additional powder which I put in first before adding the litter. This has helped. Still, after 15 days, the poop reservoir is full and sometimes starting to overflow, so I have to change it.Overall, it's better than scooping every day manually. But this comes at a price, the refills are not cheap (on sale, you can buy a regular litter box and litter for less than 1 refill) and, for me, I have to replace the refill twice a month. Overall, it would be about $360/year for me to keep this going--if it doesn't break down.",cats,2
"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers regarding the height of the tub - it should be about 4-6 inches higher to take complete pressure off your back. I am 5'4"" and I was still bending over a bit washing my medium sized dog. Overall though, it was an energy and back pain saver! It was very easy to put together and then take apart and store afterwards. Still a bit on the pricey side, but it is sturdy, thick plastic. I recommend it!",dogs,3
"I have a 1 year old Golden retriever who has a sensitive stomach. After trying Iams and Eukanuba Puppy we made the switch to the more quality California Natural Chicken and Rice Puppy formula which was great for him (firm stools and shiny coat). Now that he was ready to switch to adult formula (weighing in at 75 pounds now) I thought it sensible to choose the Adult Chicken and Rice formula by Calif. Nat. However, he has had an awful reaction even after gradually introducing the adult food with puppy food. He is itching a lot, ear infections, and chewing his paws, HORRIBLE gas, and loose stools. I do not recommend for sensitive stomach Golden Retrievers. We are going to try grain free options...",dogs,3

I don't know how I can possibly be expected to play with a toy I can't hold in my mouth or chew on. If my owner knew this was made of plastic he never would have bought it. He thought that when it said ""Push"" it said ""Plush"". Who has ever heard of us playing with a ""PUSH"" toy. What are we supposed to do with a ""PUSH"" toy. Am I supposed to play soccer or something??? That would be a helluva trick. Then I could be on David Letterman. Don't buy this for a dog. It would make a good baby toy maybe.

We had been using the cheap wooden gates for the last 10 years to keep our dogs out of the cat's area and our laundry room. This gate has a built-in cat door and the gate is expandable for different door openings. Installation was relatively easy despite the several pages of instructions that came with the gate. We chose the taller gate (big dogs) and you don't have to bend down as far to open the gate. The locking mechanism features a child-proof lock which can be enabled if desired otherwise the opening and closing of the gate is easily accomplished with one hand. The gate is made of metal so if you have small children you may prefer a plastic gate.,dogs,3

"Greenies Feline Pill Pockets are not only great for cats, they are safe to dogs, too. The makers of Greenies Pill Pockets say the only difference in the dog and cat formulas is that the pill pockets for cats have extra taurine. This is because a cat's liver has a limited ability to make taurine and also because cats lose taurine in the secretion of bile acids. It was thought that dogs don't need supplemental taurine because they can make taurine out of vitamin B and the amino acids methionine and cysteine, however, dogs are often deficient in taurine and routine supplementation is not harmful. In fact, new studies have shown that extra taurine is imperative for cardiovascular health in dogs. It was found that dogs with clinical signs of Dilated Cardiomyopathy (a.k.a. DCM, one of the most commonly acquired cardiovascular diseases in dogs) had low plasma taurine levels. Although the prognosis for dogs with this disease is not good, some did survive with care and supplemental taurine.I routinely give pill pockets for cats to my Chihuahua when administering medications (he likes both the salmon and chicken flavors). Cat pill pockets are half the size of the small pill pockets for dogs, but they are just the right size for my Chihuahua and, I am sure, other small and toy breeds, to eat without chewing (and no chewing means they don't discover the pill inside). They are cheaper by the bag than the small ones for dogs and you get 15 more pill pockets per bag (45 per bag in the cat formula versus 30 in the dog). However, because pill pockets are so pliable, and the small ones for dogs are twice the size, you could pinch those in half and they would cover 60 pills, 15 more than a bag of cat pill pockets. But, for me, it is more convenient and faster when preparing his medications to buy the cat pill pockets that are already the right size, plus I like the benefits of the added taurine.",cats,2
"These drops were recommended for my 16-year old cat, Pi, by the vet. I bought them fromRevival Animal Healththrough Amazon. PI certainly has more energy after I give him a dropper full. However, he does not particularly like having the drops squirted into his mouth. The risk is getting scratched or bitten. So, if you can give this to your cat, they may work for you.An alternative is Nu-Cat vitamin tablets which I put in the dry food for my two cats. Pi's sister, Brownie, likes to eat the Nu-cats. They make her fur very nice. Pi rarely eats the vitamins, so I have to rely on the drops for him.",cats,2

"Bought this in Feb 2009, and still on the same unit. Own 4 cats that use it plus another neighbor cat who comes to visit from time to time.I installed this in the garage next to the washer. Best place for it!! Not sure what size bathroom you need for it to fit in there but I have never had a bathroom that would work.Now that it's been in the garage, I am happy with the placement. It is loud when running. Granules do get outside of unit, but not too bad considering a 4 cat household - again...best place is the garage and the cleaning solution produces an odor until dry.Cleaning solution - DO NOT GET THE UNSCENTED!! The scented one doesn't have the best odor but it is a great deal more pleasant than the unscented.You will run through the liquid quickly if you set the timer as suggested. Since not all my cats stay indoors - I do not set the timer and just start it manually - most I have to push is 2x day. Most days it is 1x - we will see if that changes over the winter months.I love having the timer function for my pet sitters...I hated asking them to clean my cat box. Now I leave for vacation guilt free!It is suggested to clean out the unit every 6 months. I just finished this - had an error message - had some yarn and hair wrapped around the impeller. Not too bad, not a fun job but would much rather prefer 2x year getting down and dirty than 2x daily with scoopable cat litter.Yes, I would still recommend this product. It's not a magic box, not totally hands off, but makes life much better in my household.UPDATED:After about a year of use; this thing is a long lost memory. We kept having troubles with it clogging up and I got really tired of pulling it apart and cleaning out - so much more work then the old scoop kind.",cats,2

Also, the new heating pad has the ""PetMate"" name stamped on it, but came in a box that had a generic brand name - No mention of ""PetMate"". I purchased PetMate, expecting a durable, quality product. What I received today from Amazon appears to be a cheap, disposable product. Shame on Amazon and PetMate!

"There are many things wrong with this feeder but they aren't necessarily a deal breaker.1. The dispensing chute is too big, so clever cats can stick their paws up and grab a couple pieces of food at a time. My Garfield would spend almost all night and eat nearly an entire meal one piece at a time. If your Garfield is fat and determined like mine, you'll have to tape a piece of plastic to cover half of the chute opening, and that'll stop him.2. The buttons are not very tactile and the interface is pretty confusing so this thing is real hard to program. It only lets you set 3 meals per day (my cats were used to 3 or 4 small meals). I believe it lets you set different sizes per meal in 1/4 cup increments, so the one reviewer below might want to double check that.3. The lid isn't very secure but my cats haven't figured out how to take it off yet. I was afraid they'd knock it over but so far they haven't gotten to the prize through the top of the canister. A small piece of shipping tape will fix that though.4. Program is lost when batteries are replaced. Mine has done about 85 feedings so far on one set of batteries so I don't envision this to be too big of a problem.Overall this unit suffers from some pretty bad design flaws but seeing as it's the first generation of automatic feeder hopefully they will correct these problems in the next version and make a much better product.",cats,2

Now they are kept in the back, and they don't fall onto the floor when we stop short! They are safe and the seat stays clean. There is no strange odor at all that was mentioned by other reviewers(and I am sensitive to chemical smells, so I would notice that).

We find the solid light to be more pleasing as it does not tend to induce seizures while keeping track of your furry loved, however, the flashing mode on this particular light-up collar is slow enough and the light soft enough that it too is very usable if one prefers.The visibility is good without being intrusive, and we've yet to have the battery die after many hours of use.The product arrived on time and in appropriate packaging.",dogs,3
"My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is ""made with liver"".My dogs absolutely lovePro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce(the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.Specifically, these treats have chicken ""by-products""-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.",dogs,3

"I have 3 little guys. Two cocker spaniels anda jack russell terrier. So, you can imaging my surprise when none of them liked the squirrel. I got it for the jack russell terrier first because has killed live ones before when he lived in a ruraL area with my dad, but he can't live like that with me. Aparently a sueeky squirrel just didn't do it for him. They all love squeek toys , but I think that they were put off by the thick plush fur. It is very cute and soft though.",dogs,3
"Normally, I love Frontline Plus for my dog. However, I chose to order this from Amazon because the price was cheaper. This frontline did not work at all. Something was wrong with it. I order alot of ""thinks"" from Amazon and never had trouble before. I have had dogs all of my life, used frontline plus ever since it came out, and it always worked. I ended up buying Frontline Plus from another reliable place and it works ""great"" just like it always did. This was a bad batch.",dogs,3
IT sits in my garage as its worthless. My cat is small and has a hard time making it in the box and the mess is more than a regular cat box and you best wear a mask when you roll it or the cat litter dust goes all over the place. Was very disappointed in this product,cats,2

"As soon as I opened the Amazon box, Harri was right there, jumping up and grabbing the toy in her mouth and tearing off like a dog on fire. She seems to like the visual texture the dye-job provides, along with the actual texture of the fur. I got her the large dog toy, wich seems to be just the right size for her. She's a 65 lb. Coonhound, which is not what I would consider to be a large dog, for those of you wondering about which size to get. So far, it seems to be a sturdy toy, but it has yet to be tested by a good game of tug-of-war between Harri and her sister, Sally. It has held up very well to a lot of other plush toys, and I've found that I've had good luck with Dr. Noys in the past, so I'm more likely to take a chance on Dr. Noys compared to other plush toys.",dogs,3
"We were sick of looking at an ugly litter box so when we spotted this one in a store we came home to see if we could find it cheaper on Amazon. It was $99 in the store and on sale for $30 less on here plus we got the free shipping.Putting it together:Hubby was impressed with how they had all the parts in their own individual bags for each step. Usually he spends time counting and sorting but they eliminate that for you. After reading other reviews I started to worry my boys may accidentally pee (they were fixed as kittens so no spraying) on the inside walls since they were use to a high sided litter box not just the pan. I noticed a few reviewers mentioned the ""Iris CLH-12 Open-Top Litter Box with Shield"" so we bought that as well. Just in case I also took recomendations in putting clear contact paper on the bottom floor and walls. I didn't want to chance any bubbling, possible rotting and urin smell. After I did that he had it together in 20 minutes. All the holes were linned up and everything was in order.The Iris CLH-12 Open-Top Litter Box with Shield does fit right in snuggly. If you don't put it in precisly the front door will pop open. Re-adjust and all is well. My boys fit right in.I took a star away because of 2 reasons:1. No matter what litter box you use the rim of it is always higher than the door. My cats (one short and stout and the other long and tall) drag their backs across the top of the door when they go in because they have to put their front paws on the litter box to climb in. If they put the door about 1/2"" higher they would have better clearing.2. I have noticed they don't cover their ""business"" like they use to either. I think it needs to be a bit taller and wider. Then it would be perfect for clearance in going in head on and then turning around. Then turn around again to cover and turn around forward to head back out. There's just not a lot of space for that.If you want to get this because you think it will cut down on your cats tracking out litter, it doesn't. I still find the same amount outside the front of it. I plan on getting a matt for the front of it.Overall this does exactly what I want it to",cats,2
I bought this for my Shepherd Mix who gets really hot in the summer. Here's the main reasons I say to NOT buy this,dogs,3
"The FURminator does just what it promises...gets all that undercoat you didn't even know was there. It would be great to have a vacuum cleaner running nearby to suck up all the hair that must be pulled off the comb. I used it outside and it blew all over the place. But it is the best comb I have ever used on my cat. Now I don't have big lumps of hair all over my house.It is best to go easy and not press too hard, especially on the spine and other bony areas. I have used it at least five times and still get masses of hair.I think it's the ""Cat's Meow.""",cats,2
"We purchased this kennel last April for our 2YO Siberian Husky. Today it went into the trash. He had chewed at some of the plastic slats to the point where they were loose and he tried to get his snout through the opening, causing several cuts to his face. Yes, dogs will be dogs, but if you have an escape artist dog this kennel is not for you. I would also note that the manufacturer does not stand by this product.",dogs,3
"These granules work fine in our CatGenie - we've had it for almost two months and have had no problems with clogging or sticking or anything. We have it set to run a automatically a few times a day and are very happy not to be scooping litter anymore! Many people have commented about the granules ending up around the house and they do get kicked or tracked out of the CatGenie pretty easily. We have ours in our bathroom, though, and have found that keeping a dustpan nearby and sweeping them up every few days works well. As long as you're not picking up a lot of floor grunge with them, you can just dump them right back into the CatGenie and they'll get washed clean on the next cycle. This cuts down on the amount of granule purchasing we have to do. Also, be sure not to overfill the CatGenie - overfilling can cause clogs. The fill line was lower than I expected, but the litter stays so clean that the cats don't seem to mind.",cats,2

"I purchased this product months ago and tried it on my cocker spaniel that has serious cockertude. Fudge barks at everyone except his people. He sees the neighbors everyday and everyday he barks at them. Almost sounds like he cursing. Anyway, I purchased this collar and placed it on him and nothing. I called customer service and they said it needs to be tight. I adjusted it and still nothing. I put it away and didn't think try it on again until yesterday. I adjusted it again. It was very tight but I could still get a finger under it. My neighbor came over and Fudge started to bark. He got out three little barks before the collar zapped him. He seemed shocked, (pun intended) as if he was thinking ""what the heck?"" He decided that he was gonna try it again. Two barks....ZAP. That was it, that was all she wrote. Fudge is a smart little guy. He quickly figured out that barking would get him zapped. Poor little guy looked a bit sad at first because he loves ""cursing"" out the neighbors, but he got over it after a game of fetch.I honestly felt that this thing was too amazing to be true. Four years of a barking dog was corrected in only a few minutes. This collar is great!!! The only fault I have with it is that it has to put on very tight in order to work.",dogs,3

"We got this for my Maine Coon and his brother to use while we went on vacation and it was performed amazingly. We considered an auto-feeder, but were worried about what if it malfunctioned or the power went out, so this was perfect.

"I have one 55 gallon aquarium and one 15 gallon aquarium inhabited by 6 aquatic turtles. Before I discovered this product, my aquarium would get fouled up, stinky, and murky within a month after a complete water change, even with the filters running full tilt.

This stuff is a must if you own aquatic turtles, just add some every time you do a water change or a filter cleaning.",fish aquatic pets,4

"We have a lab mix, now 12 years old and doing amazingly well on Wellness Senior. We had a scary experience with another ""natural"" dog food. After using it for over a year this other brand suddenly made our dog very ill. We did not figure it out right away as he is a lab and will eat ANYTHING. Usually once or twice a year he gets into something that make him ill for a few days. Last time, we did our usual routine of rice and chicken stock. He got better, put him back on the other food, and he got worse again. After another cycle like that, we realized it must be the other food. So we went down tot he local pet shop looking for something better. They recommended Wellness and we have never looked back. After only a week or so on Wellness, Bear's coat got was noticeably more lustrous. Now, almost two years later we still are amazed by this food. I love the fact that it does not even smell like ""dog food"". The ingredients list is totally free of the usual gunk that is in most food. Yeah it is a bit more expensive, but totally worth it. Even his stool does not smell!",dogs,3
"I've never had a dog that cared about Kongs. This is small, so any treat I put inside is either too small and falls right out, or too big and the puppy can't get it out. I'm over trying to get my dogs to like Kongs.",dogs,3

"Here are the problems associated with keeping a betta (or any fish) in a small amount of water:1, Size. Bettas can grow up to 3.5&quot;, this tank is 4&quot; in diameter, sound like a tight fit to you? Also, bettas do not &quot;love&quot; to live in small spaces. They are much happier in larger amounts of water. Mine lives happily w/ all my other fish in my 20 gallon, and another happy in his 2 gallon.2, There is no filtration. You would have to do 100% water changes DAILY, which may be stressful for the fish. However, not changing the water daily would result in deadly ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite levels, which are toxic to fish.3, Temperature & Water Chemistry. It is very hard to keep a constant temperature in such a small tank, as the temperature can change within minutes, which can result in death. Same goes w/ the water chemistry.Bettas live in those small cups at pet stores because if put together, they will most likely kill each other. These cups are not meant to be their permanent homes, they are just a cheap, easy way to keep them separated.I don't mean to bash this product, I just don't think that it is an appropriate home for a fish. As said before, there is a larger Sponge Bob tank available that would be much better for a betta. Please do your research first!",fish aquatic pets,4

"I have to first say that I wouldn't put anything on my dogs/cat, that would hurt them. I even tried it on the palm of my hand to see how much the shock would hurt. It didn't hurt at all. I would say it is like a static shock when you rub your feet on the carpet and touch someone. I had a problem with my dogs getting into the litter boxes. I used this to see if I could keep them out of there. Well it took a few times getting zapped and now they get it. They don;t even have to wear the collar anymore. Now we don't have to crate or limit the dogs space while we are not around. I recommended this to all my friends with problems and would highly recommend it here.",dogs,3
"I have a Golden Retriever who has been struggling with scaly, dry, scabby skin for about six months. We've tried different shampoo, allergy, and other medicines from the vet. The combination of all three would only slightly help his skin. So as a last ditch effort I did a search on amazon and found this product! I am so thankful that I did! His screen drastically cleared up after two weeks of using the product. It lathers nicely and does not have a smell. I highly recommend this product!",cats,2
"I bought this because I have a little shih tzu. He would sit in the front passenger seat of my car when we went somewhere. He would stand up and try to see out the window and would roll the window down every time. That worried me a lot. Then, he wasn't strapped in, so anytime I turned or put on the brakes, he flew off the seat. He never got hurt, but I worried that he might one day. So, I started looking for a way to keep him safe. I found this and thought it might work. It definitely wasn't too expensive, so it was worth a try. I installed it very easily. It even came in green - his personal color scheme :) - so I was happy. I put him in the seat. I hooked him to the little latch. At first, he tried to jump out. But I just reassured him, and in seconds, he was calm and enjoying his new ""chair."" He can see out the window now. He doesn't fly around the car. And I don't worry about hurting him with braking or on turns. Sometimes, he gets so comfortable that he falls asleep in it. I like that the seat is easy to install and uninstall. It's easy to use and I would definitely recommend it to all small dog owners.",dogs,3
"No less work than cleaning out a real litter box. We eventually took the lid off and just use the base. Requires a lot of space to roll.

Takes just a few seconds to put on her.There are very few small things that are life changing but this halter is one of them.",dogs,3

"As a person who interracts with aggressive dogs on a daily basis and has had many occasions to try this product, I've found the title to be a bit misleading. While this will temporarily annoy/disorient some aggressive dogs, if a dog is really determined enough this will not ""stop"" him. Please heed the ""fine print"" warning on the label before counting on this for your safety. I'll give this three stars as this will temporarily distract your low-medium aggressive dogs thus allowing you a chance to escape. I simply cannot give this 4-5 because it is not effective against a high-violent aggressive dog. It's better than nothing but PLEASE always have a back up plan....",dogs,3

"I'm not sure if there's a trick to get your pup to use this or not, but our pup has not used this once and we've had it for about a month... One challenge is that our pup is already house-trained, but wanted him to be able to use the pad late nights or early mornings. I knew I was taking a bit of a chance since our pup is house trained already... I've tried many of the techniques suggested by others but to no avail. So perhaps lowered expectations are required for trained pups? Nevertheless, I will keep trying different ideas for a bit more.",dogs,3

So don't buy this one if you also have a larger type of cat.",cats,2
"We got this as our dog's birthday present. We wanted something that would be both tasty and durable for him, as the regular rawhide bones last nothing in his jaws.We expected a huge reaction from him, yet when we opened the box in front of him, he was rather underwhelmed. After a few minutes, he started trying it out, and the couple next days he did chew on it for a while... almost 2 months later, he's still chewing on it, not because it's so durable, but because he grabs it only every once in a while.It's nice, it will last forever, but it definitely didn't beat a baseball, which is quite durable, and is my dog's current favorite.",dogs,3
"We have a larger (16 lb) female Maine Coon and I find this product to be great. I previously used a Littersweep..which was junk. This one works exactly as advertised If you have multiple cats the refill will NOT last 30 days which is exactly what the literature says so don't expect it. Others have complained about the noise...well, it is a machine after all and while not totally silent it is very quiet. Others have complained about the poop receptacle.. it IS about full @ 30 days (the interval at which I change it)so it lasts adaquately and again what the literature suggests. There is always the option of scooping some out prior to the 30 change limit. It is dehydrated and you will find it quite light and dried out if you try that. Others have complained that it (the refill tray) leaks urine early into its life...not possible unless you have about four cats or are doing something wrong. Others have complained about mechanical failure early on...maybe, but simply exersize your return rights and get another. Others have complained about poor odor control...well I have found a slight ammonia odor toward the very end of its 30 day lifespan. Frankly, about the only thing I find ""wrong"" is the cost of the refills but maybe if one were to compute the costs of regular clumping litter..the aggravation of playing with the broken clumps as I found I had to do with the Littersweep and probably with other automated boxes which utilize clumping litter the cost may not be that bad. So, all in all I quite like it. Keep in mind nothing is perfect but this is as close as I have found with automated cat litter boxes.",cats,2
"This leash feels so well made. Works very smoothly. I like the length at 16 feet, not too long and gives my dog a bit of room to sniff and explore. The leash retracts and gives so smoothly that I almost feel like there is no leash. I love it so far. I like the fact that it is a woven tape instead of a string-like leash, which makes it feel more durable. Only time will tell how well this lasts but right now I highly recommend.",dogs,3

"My 12 week old puppy loves this, but it was not what I expected. It looks like a semi-transparent bone with openings on the top to put tiny treats in. What it actually is a rubber bone (very flexible) with cut outs that go clean through on both ends for those long stick treats (like the Ziggles Kong makes). I haven't used them with the treats because those seem a bit expensive (and it wasn't what I was expecting for them to be), but my little Lhasa Shih loves how thin the bone is because she can easily fit the middle part in her mouth. Unlike the Nylabone puppy toys which are still fairly firm, this is very flexible (which she seems to like the gummy texture of). I opened the box yesterday, and she was trying to swipe it from me as I got it out of the package. She couldn't be happier.",dogs,3

This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix, and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated. Still, our dog has tossed it around, and I've found Dr. Noy's toys to be quite durable.",dogs,3

"Quickie note to cat owners:This ball is totally adjustable, but you should NOT try to open it from the middle of the ball!I am seeing comments how the ball dumps out food, is too hard to fill from the middle, etc.The intended way to use it is to DIAL the middle to get the hole size right for the food you put in there.To fill it, use the BOTTOM with the little twist section. Twist clockwise to get it off.The instructions on how to use the ball are packed INSIDE the ball, which was really a bad idea.But, don't break your ball trying to pry it open. Open the BOTTOM of the ball and take out the directions,then twist the cap back on, dial the size and give to your kitty.Hope that helps someone!UPDATE 12/27/10 -We ordered a SECOND one of these balls. We got a pink one. This one arrived in great condition,wasn't warped, and works great. Now, I have no clue as to why, but one of our cats seems to preferthe pink ball already! Ha! No clue as to why - we put the same food in them. I think I got a dirty look whenI refilled the green ball instead of the pink one. We use the same food in them, so it isn't that - he just seemsto prefer the pink one. Maybe he just likes new things! Either way - this is a great item, and we're still veryglad we got it. While we hear the midnight snack raids with the ball being rolled around, we don't get jumped onor walked on to come and put some food in their dishes.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Original review below~~~~~~~~~~~~Well, I wasn't sure how well this item might work, but decided to give it a try. I must say, I find it to be pretty ""pricey"" for a hollow plastic ball!When we got it, the first goofy thing about this is that the instructions on how to OPEN the ball without breaking any of the thin plastic parts are packed INSIDE OF THE BALL!! Yup - you have to open the ball to read the directions on how to open the ball.Someone got paid big bucks for that lame packaging design! I also truly do feel that this item is overpriced as is. I'd buy several of them if they were between $3-$4, but as is, one will have to do for our household.Once you brave breaking the new plastic ball and just fiddle with it to open the ball, you'll see the directions are pretty much as expected. (Note - I'm not a dummy, but this is not a heavy-duty ball. I was afraid I'd force something that had some sort of little plastic hinge in the wrong direction and bust it before ever using it!) The ball has three pieces, and I'll explain how to use it in detail. I know, some will think it is stupid to do so, but I can live with that. For the rest who want to know exactly how this one works, read on.Spoiler alert",cats,2

"I have been looking EVERYWHERE for this catnip spray since I found a bottle of it at a local dollar store. This has to be the BEST catnip product of all time. When I spray it on my cats' toys they go totally nuts! Toys they haven't played with in years, ok months, are drooled & fought over. While I wish I were still paying a buck a bottle for it, its worth every penny just to find it. Can't wait to see them Christmas morning when they find it in their stockings.",cats,2

I have an Italian Greyhound that likes to find the seam in a carpet and pull it so she unravels the carpet. I got this hoping I could spray areas and she would leave it alone. I have light colored carpet and I didn't want to have to put chili pepper all over. Well she didn't like the smell in the bottle so I thought that was promising but when I sprayed it she didn't care and kept pulling at the carpet. When you read the bottle is sounds more like it is to keep them from licking them selves.,dogs,3

"The gentle leader makes it much easier to control my dogs pulling. My lab doesnt pull nearly as hard, but she stops mid walk and try to pull off the leader with her front paws. I'm hoping she'll get used to the leader and stop doing that. The leader is wonderful for my bassett hound. The bassett could slip out of regular collars and pulled too hard with a harness. This works much better.",dogs,3

"I guess it's an electronic item so some might not work, but I really don't see how anyone can give this a bad review. I am using it for a real bird, not as a toy for myself. So my review is very serious.I have a very aggressive budgie and she bosses over and bullies the smaller one. She is spoiled silly and after the other one died of a stroke (when we were away nonetheless), we thought we should transition her with this toy.She was scared stiff at first because she is scared of everything at first. Now she abuses the budgie buddy. I am so happy it's a toy and not a real bird. A real bird will not be able to take this amount of torture. But she thinks it's real and plays with it. The buddy sings back. It takes a while to get used to that cheeping noise, but hey if the bird likes it, it stays. You can see why my bird is spoiled now, can't you?So my advice, buy these when you can't buy real birds for various reasons (even if you are still in mourning).",birds,0

But it seemed nice, so I took a c chance and got it. Wow. I have never seen a cat so ""in love""...LOL. You open the bottom of the little squirrel, pour a bit of the catnip in, and voila, cat heaven. Kitty played with this a long time. To test whether or not she would like it even if there was no catnip, I threw out the old bits in the middle and dusted the insides out. She played with the little squirrel itself. When I put catnip in the middle she holds it like a baby.Amazing. Great product, for us.",cats,2

I recently used my new Argo pet carrier to transport my cat across the country on JetBlue. The medium carrier fit perfectly under the seat in front of me and the desk agent didn't give it a second glance after saying hello to the kitty inside. The double mesh windows seemed very secure and their relatively small size insured that the cat couldn't have escaped even if she had been inclined to rip them. The smaller windows also meant that she was calmer because she couldn't really see how many people were around. I was a bit nervous about ventilation at first but I kept checking on her and she didn't seem to be getting too hot. She was definitely the coolest kitty at Logan International. I highly recommend this bag.,dogs,3
"One of our cats, only seven years old, began to develop a substantial limp in his right front leg. The vet diagnosed arthritis and prescribed Cosequin, which is primarily a combination of Glucosamine and Chondroitin. We've been giving it to our cat for the last half year, and his limp has almost entirely disappeared. Since it's rather unlikely that our cat is experiencing a placebo effect, I'm inclined to credit the Glucosamine and Chondroitin.After experimenting with dosage, we've settled on three pills a day (the cat is 14.5 pounds), given in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Even if we forget one once in a while it's no big deal (it helps to have one of those daily pill cases to keep track). The cat has gotten very used to having a pill shoved down his throat. One person can lay him on his side, open his jaws, and poke the pill down with the other hand. It only takes a couple of seconds. Of course, your mileage may vary; some cats are terrible at taking pills.Cosequin is available from many web sites all over the Internet, sometimes even with free shipping. But Amazon has a decent price. It's all the same brand.",cats,2

This item was misrepresented. As shown in the picture there is a clear lid on this ball. When I received mine today it has several holes and no lids to cover any of them. This is advertised as a ferret roll around ball and instead it is actually a ball that conects to tubes for the ferret to crawl through. If possible I would like the covers to the openings sent to me. I am not returning the product because its not worth the shipping or the trip to the post office. I am very dissapointed that there is no way to contact Amazon about problems with orders. If the seller is an individual you can contact them but if the seller is Amazon there is no way to contact them.

"This is a powder product to eliminate tear stains on the facial fur of dogs. It works well. After a few doses--mixed with food--the conjunctivitis that causes the staining disappears. My dogs are 10 and 11 pounds and I have to mix 3/4 tsp in their food once a day at first. Because my dogs usually eat only kibble, it's been a little challenging. I think it doesn't work well to mix the powder with dairy products such as cottage cheese as I tried this, and it seemed to null the effect--some antibiotics don't work well with simultaneous dairy ingestion. I'm not sure if this is one of them. Instead, I mix the product with scrambled egg. The dogs love it. Also the largest size is the most economical because one must dose the dog every day.",dogs,3

This collar works great when used right. My dog now knows more commands thanks to this great tool. I have two just in case. :-),dogs,3
". Upon receiving this collar I put it on my chihuahua and found that the rechargable transmitter was dead. I plugged the transmitter into the charger, the red light lit on the charger and my dog was shocked. The transmitter battery was dead because the transmitter was stuck in the on and shock mode. So when I plugged it into the charger it began transmitting the shock signal to the collar. I took the transmitter apart and removed the battery and reinstalled it and it began working properly. Then the problem with the collar began. After a few hours the collar light went solid red and the collar stopped working. I replaced the batteries and tried again. Withen a few hours the collar light went solid red and quit responding again. I cut the collar off and back on and it worked a couple hours and quit again. I do not recommend this collar. It is cheaply built. The only reason I ordered it was because Tri Tronics does not make one for small dogs (8 lbs)",dogs,3
"My dog and I LOVE this chew toy. It lasts virtually forever. Cooper is a 130lb Bullmastiff and she's had her Nylabone Chew Ring for over a year. We've tried the Nylabone chew toy in the bone shape, but it eventually gets chewed down and becomes a choking hazard. Since this is ring-shaped, your dog can chew forever and it won't get smaller! Beware though, if your dog is a strong chewer, the smooth texture becomes sharp. We haven't noticed her mouth bleeding, but since Cooper also likes to carry her ring and toss it in the air, she sometimes scratches us with the sharp edges. She likes to fetch her ring too. I recommend this chew toy to ALL dog owners. I've bought this at pet stores and its half the price on Amazon. Cooper has 3 ",dogs,3

"Some time ago I started looking into what is in pet food and was horrified, so I decided to find better food for them. I usually buy one bag of this brand and one bag of AvoDerm and mix them together. I've long been a believer that cats should eat fruits and vegetables, and this food has some of both in it, so they get more variety than they would with most cat foods.I'm not sure of what changes the cats may have had since eating this food, but it does seem like the food lasts longer than it used to. Whatever the case, the cats are all healthy and love this food. One of the cats has gained a few too many pounds since she got spayed a couple years ago, so I'm going to get the reduced calorie formula for her and see if that helps.",cats,2

Anything else I seem to bring home is underwhelming.Giving this three stars because it works perfectly as intended, but wanted to show that my cat wasn't a fan so like any cat toy there is risk involved.I'm donating this to the local cat shelter and hoping that their cats will love it more than mine did.",cats,2

"Simple Solutions Pup'sters Washable Diaper Garment, Extra-Extra LargeI had a female dog that started peeing in the house. Turned out she had a thyroid problem, but the peeing inside became a habit before I realized. I tried everything to get rid of the smell and get her to stop to no avail. These were a lifesaver. I bought the extra-large but I had to get the large - one size smaller than she measured for. No problem though. I use the cheap feminine pads. They work great.I only wish they had the diapers in a different color for large. My dog is black and the navy diaper blends in when I'm stumbling out of bed to let them out to pee. Many a time I've forgotten she had them on in the early morning light and let her out and she peed in them. Whoops!

"4 hard-earned stars for surviving a month of regular chewing with my pit bull-Boxer mix. Carlow destroys toys like it is his job, and before this toy, only the classic red Kong had eluded his compulsive eating of rubber and plastic toys (he tears holes in the soft ones and pulls out all the stuffing).He loves to gnaw on the bacon-flavored hard plastic parts, and that is where it has gotten sharp in places. To my knowledge it hasn't made his gums bleed, but it wouldn't surprise me if it did. I don't expect this bone to last forever or even a year before I have to take it away from him, but its ability to keep Carlow occupied and content for weeks without any kind of mess makes it worth $10-11.One reviewer mentioned her staffordshire bull terrier shredding the green middle in minutes, and that really surprises me. It's almost hard to believe, since rubber is like, Carlow's favorite food. He shreds rubber toys and chews on their maimed carcasses until I take them away. The rubbery green part is very solid (unless your dog shreds the classic Kong, you should be fine), and the bacon-flavored plastic keeps Carlow from taking any interest in devouring the middle.",dogs,3

I bought one thinking it was a bit pricey. Was I wrong. It was worth every penny and more. Not only do ALL the dogs now like to get brushed, but so do the cats. It does a wonderful job on their coats. I had to laugh, my husband used it one day not realizing what kind of brush it was and he told me it was the most soothing thing he had ever used on his head.I will say I do not think I would use these if the dogs were matted to the skin, but to comb our dogs every few day with this brush is one of the best thing I could do for our dogs coats.

I've read recommendations to buy the larger version if you have larger cats, but this size workes fine for my cats, and one of the three cats is quite long, and has no problem. I could see if a large and fat cat used it there could be a problem.To use you just roll the thing over, roll it back, give it a shake to flatten out the unused litter and then pull out the tray and dump it.It is quite odor free, unless one of the cats forgets to bury!3 recommendations for use:1.place a berber type of rug under/in front of the unit to catch litter- as cats will leave a trail as they exit, and the rug can easily be vaccuumed or shook over the trash or outside.2.Don't over fill with that premium litter as it will end up in the discard tray when you tilt it.3. I make it my a.m. routine to roll it over, empty the tray each day, and the cats have been using it, and the tray is then easily emptied, because if you let it go too long, the waste will not all fit into the discard tray.

"I have used this sling for my 12 pound Havanese, and he does well in it thus far. But while I read manufacturer descriptions of a padded shoulder strap, the strap is NOT padded. If your dog is near the 20 lb weight limit, this could get uncomfortable rather quickly. I wished for padding with my little guy-- and I wore the sling over a shirt, sweater, and winter jacket. Also, if I wear it at hip height (any longer doesn't really make sense), the plastic buckle is high up against my shoulder blades and uncomfortable. Because I was wearing it over many layers for a winter outing, it was fine, but I'll have to figure something out for warmer weather use. But it generally is a great idea.

"My JRT mix needs LOTS of exercise and this does the trick. I like to bring him to the local park where there's an enclosed baseball field. There we play fetch without him running off when other people and dogs pass by. With little effort, I am able to throw the ball about 200 feet using this Chuckit! Mini Ball Launcher. Just be careful not to throw the ball too high... when I do it my dog sometimes loses sight of the ball! The only bad thing is the ball isn't very bouncy but if you replace the tennis ball packaged with this launcher with the Chuckit! Ultra Ball, that'll do the trick!",dogs,3
"I originally bought a Furminator but it got lost in the mail and I really didn't want to spend another $30 to get another one. I saw this brush in a local store for a quarter of the price so I thought that I would give it a try since it was so cheap. If it didn't work, not a big deal right? I've only used it once but it seems to pull large quantities of hair off of my shedding labradoodle. I got a small shopping bag full in about 30 minutes. I've never actually used the Furminator so I can't compare but I think this product is a great bang for your buck.",dogs,3

"My dog is on a raw diet, which is impractical when traveling. I feed Stella & Chewy's freeze-dried food during trips and it works out beautifully. The patties may be re-hydrated or fed dry - my dog loves them either way.IMO the true measure of dog food's quality is the dog's ""output."" I'm happy to report that whenever my dog eats this food for a few days his stools are *normal* without any dietary upset whatsoever, despite the fact there's often stress involved in travel.Some people feed this food as a main diet, but it can get expensive depending on the size of your dog.If you're dabbling in raw feeding or need a practical alternative for traveling, buy Stella & Chewy's without hesitation. It's a great product and all of the flavors are delicious according to my dog. :-)",dogs,3

"My cats absolutely love this product. They enjoy eating socially, so they tend to eat more than they ought to. When I was controlling their portions, they would get frustrated with me and constantly whine for food, regardless of hunger. This device has reduced the amount of social eating in my house, which has reduced the overall amount that they consume. It has also restored peace, since I am not actively participating in the feeding anymore.Programming it was simple and only took a few minutes. My only complaint is that the programming is not very advanced. It is not possible to vary the amount of food that is dispensed per feeding. Whatever food setting you choose applies to all feedings. In my household it means that they are either getting too much or too little.",cats,2
"If your pet engages in, er, ""inappropriate elimination,"" normal cleaners don't do the trick to get the smell out. This stuff works pretty well, although it seems to take a few days for the smell to really fade.

I got a kick out of crawling around the house like Grissom from CSI, looking for all the cat pee. Of course, the thrill of that activity wears thin after a while.",cats,2
"I've been feeding my dog Merrick canned food mixed with some Halo dry food for four months now. He loves it (he's a picky eater) and he's super healthy! I've heard some reviews that say this food leads to gassiness and diarrhea... I imagine that could be true if someone was switching their dog from a very low quality dry or canned food because this is a wholesome, stew-like food. It takes some adjustment to get used to but once your dog has adjusted, I don't think you'll find a better quality canned dog food.",dogs,3
I was hesitant to buy a metal crate because I didn't want it to take up so much space when I wasn't using it. (I foster dogs and cats for my local Animal Control when they are over capacity.) This crate is WONDERFUL. It collapses down VERY easily and can be tucked away under a bed with no problem. The bottom tray slides out and can be washed off in seconds. I use this crate for cats and dogs alike and have nothing but good things to say about it. There is no reason what-so-ever to buy a more expensive one. This one is just fantastic!,dogs,3

"I had purchased the premium variety of these treats when Costco carried them, and my dogs loved them. I bought the original recipe treats here because the premium was too expensive. What I recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust (Amazon shipped it thrown in with several books, with no padding around it). One of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces (the other dog would eat sawdust if I offered it to him), which makes me think they have gone bad. Since I cannot find a use-by date on the package, I do not trust that this is a wholesome, safe product. the remainder has gone into the rubbish. For the safety of your animals, I advise that you not purchase these from Amazon. I believe they sell old product.",dogs,3
"I bought the fleece lined Muttluks 3 years ago and they are still in great shape. I don't know if the quality has changed in the past 3 years. I (my dog) only use them during the winter, which lasts for 6 months in Alaska. I use them when the temperature falls below 0. I would guess that I use them on average, for 3-4 hours per week.Daylight in the winter can be as short as 4 hours per day and I especially like the reflective material on the straps. By the time I get home from work, we have to walk in the dark.The muttluks are great for walking on packed snow although your dog will have to get used to limited traction. My dog often likes to walk through deeper snow and snow will get packed into the sock above the straps.The muttluks would fall off when I first started to use them. I was afraid of getting them too tight and cutting off my dog's circulation. With some practice, I know how tight they need to be and they never fall off.The muttluks fit great and are contoured to the shape of a dog's foot. Most booties I have seen are square and flop loosely on the foot.",dogs,3

"I have two cats, one male one female, and the female has had sporadic issues with using the litterbox. It was getting progressivly worse, and eventually got to the point where I was cleaning up messes at least once per day. She would use the litterbox sometimes, and other times go right next to or in front of it. I had her checked out for health issues, and my vet said she was fine, and to try this litter and get a second litter box.I kept one litterbox with their old litter, and one new one with this Cat Attract litter. My male cat used the Cat Attract right away, but my female cat used the old litter for the first day. The next day, she was using the new Cat Attract litter. It's been about a week now, and my female cat is now using the new Cat Attract consistenly, and actually burying everything after she goes too! (Before she would not bury anything) I also like the litter itself, clumps well, low dust and pretty good odor control. Both cats now use the new litter, but I still keep the old litter in the second box, so there is always a clean litterbox just in case. This Cat Attract is such a life saver! I'm happy, my cats are happy, and I can stop thinking about having to keep her confined to a small space, or taking her to a shelter. It might not work for everyone, but definetely worth trying if you have a cat with litterbox issues - just give it a day or two to start working.",cats,2
"I was looking forward to receiving and using this leash, as I remember Hamilton products as being pretty good. I was disappointed. It's supposed to be black, and instead is sort of a mottled greenish black. I tried lightly oiling the leather, thinking that would help, but it didn't. Also, one section of the leather is thinner and stretchier than the rest. Not only does it look bad, it will not stand up to a dog that pulls, as mine does. The snap is the right color and weight, and looks good.I would return the item, but probably can't, due to having tried oiling it to even up the color and condition it...not to mention the hassle. I will probably just donate it to the local animal shelter.",dogs,3

"This may work differently on larger dogs compared to small ones, but here is my review. I have a dog that is about 12 pounds, and almost 11 months old. I purchased this product just a couple of months ago and on day one his behavior changed significantly. I like to brag that I have very smart dog- but he'd use his brains for evil, lol! I cannot turn this collar above 2 or 3- although it goes up to 10. He responds as low as one, as a matter of fact he responds well to the sound, without use of the pulse. I used to have to call my dog a million times before he'd respond, now he comes the first time. If I tell him to get in his pen, he runs and jumps in, he stopped jumping up on the couch and no longer jumps on my guest, he even stopped some of his excited urination. All of these changes came within the matter of a couple of days of use. I used to have to watch him to make sure he didn't sneak into the back of the housse, now, even when let loose he doesn't leave the kitchen and he will go stay in his pen with the gate wide open. I have not gotten him fully house broken- I am working on doing that part. As soon as he is broken then I will put the pen up. I have not hd problems with the batteries or the unit breaking. My smart dog has learned how to turn the collar off, so I must make sure it is on before I try correcting him with it.This was definitely worth the investment, it has helped us all enjoy our time with my cute little dog even more.",dogs,3
"I bought the largest model (Model 620) of this cage to house two guinea pigs in the plastic pan by removing the grill floor.The cage is well-built and easy to assemble. However, it was poorly packaged and slightly damaged during shipping. The mesh roof was bent and scuffed and some of the blue paint was scuffed.(Other reviews have said that this cage does not work well with rabbits because they can urinate down the legs of the cage.)With the grill floor removed, I'm not very confident in the security of the plastic pan with the weight of animals, food bowls, etc. The two end clips, designed to stabilize and secure the plastic pan, do not work at all. They do not clip onto the pan as intended.Therefore, the pan easily slides out of the cage. Once the pan is out a couple of inches, it is free to flex and fall to the floor.Although not recommended by the manufacturer, my solution was to cut the lip off both ends of the plastic pan, remove the top of the cage and slide the pan in so that it rests on the grill floor. The pan fits perfectly this way and is more secure.Furthermore, if the grill floor is relocated to the slots intended for the pan, the two end clips actually work and help secure and stabilize the grill floor.Such a large cage on wheels is a great idea, but I think the design needs some work.I communicated these concerns to the manufacturer, thinking the feedback may be appreciated. The response was mainly confusion (intentional?) of the shipping damage with the modifications I had to make, and denial of any problems with the design.",small animals,5

"I was reading the reviews people wrote for this item and I actually was surprised. I have had my littermaid for almost 3 months now and it's the best thing I have ever bought. Sure the motor is loud but I'm willing to put up with a little noise to avoid having to scoop daily (I only have one cat). I could see how this product might be a hassle for those with multiple cats, but I just see a lot of complaining in these reviews about how much work this product is. I only have to clean out the receptacle every 5 days and my cat loves it! She actually runs when the motor starts up to watch it clean.The only thing that made me give this item 4 stars instead of 5 was that I do buy premium litter and sometimes there are small pieces that do not get scooped out...but really if I only have to deal with that, what's to complain about?",cats,2
"I recommend this product to my clients who have dogs with an overabundance of energy. Physical exercise is important, but without an equal amount of mental exercise, many dogs will still have problems.

It is made of a soft plastic, so really destructive chewers should be supervised. This is also great for dogs with mild separation anxiety to distract them before you leave the house. There is also a small size for dogs under 30 lbs.",dogs,3

"I bought this collar for my short-haired, 40-lb dog. It worked twice, and has not worked since. The collar itself is very narrow, and lightweight, so it is difficult to keep the device positioned properly on the dog's neck. We have tested it, per the instructions, and it says it is working (the light flashes and it emits a beep) but it does nothing when on the dog. The first two times, we saw the light flash, and heard the beep, when the dog barked, but not since then. We have tried tightening it, but if we adjust it so it is any tighter, the dog won't be able to breathe. We loosened it, and it moved out of position on her neck when she got into her bed. Not sure what the problem is, but the collar is going back to the store!",dogs,3

I find that I need to also use doggie bags (& I don't even have a dog), & as another LitterLocker user suggested, drop in disinfectant wipes or spray for the clean up to be bearable. Altho every 2-week disposal is the ""required"" according to the box, I do week cleaning.

Da Bird keeps her attention for at least 15 minutes. In fact, each time I have put it away she has made it clear she wants to continue. With other toys I had to bring the toy close to her body before she'd interact. Da Bird has her racing around the room chasing after it.

"I have always resisted buying a bark collar, because I firmly believe there are times a dog SHOULD bark - and I also believe they need some freedom to do what comes naturally. But after 4 years of early morning bark-fests to warn us of the squirrels and deer invading the yard and to let the whole house know someone is leaving for school, I finally gave in. I had been trying to offer treats to encourage ""quiet,"" but all that approach accomplished was ""Oh, I see a deer - let me go get a treat."" It was a high-maintenance approach I couldn't continue with consistency - so the barking continued. After a couple of false starts with this collar, it seems to be doing the job quite nicely.The first time I put it on our dog, she sneezed when she got sprayed - and the sneeze elicited another spray, which really confused her! I didn't think that was really fair, and at that point, I thought this wasn't going to work. A couple of weeks later, after more ear-splitting bark sessions, I gave it another try. It seems to be working quite well. She might let out one small bark, and once she figures out she's going to get sprayed, she is quiet. (Almost too quiet!). I only use the collar when I really need her to not bark - usually early mornings and at dusk when the deer get active again - and I take it off when she goes outside to survey her world, bark a little to let everyone know she's there, etc. Since we live in a single-family home, I don't need to leave the collar on when I'm not home - so she's free to do her thing when no one is here. She seems to be learning to give it one small test before letting her barking instincts take over. She isn't happy when she finds out the collar is on - but she respects it and has not figured out she can bark til the sprayer runs out, as some reviewers have noted. Note - the breed we have is a mix of Australian Cattle Dog and beagle. Very smart (Cattle Dog) but loves to bark (beagle.)",dogs,3

"my dog chews the feet off first thing when he gets a new cuz toy, but there is no toy EVER that has ever maintained his interest other than the cuz balls. the small is just the right size for my mini dachshund, the firmness and the squeaker...I'm totally curious exactly what it is that makes the dogs love them so much. I even bought a large bad cuz for myself because i love the design-- squid whined at the mantel for days because he wanted to play with the ball.

"I read through most of the reviews on here before buying this (yes all 400+ of them) because our lab-mix pup is a heavy chewer and I wanted to make sure this wouldn't be an expensive piece of trashed fluff that we bought.Pumpkin (our lab-mix) absolutely loves this toy. When he first got the toy I had stuffed all the little squirrels inside and just tossed it to him. As soon as he grabbed it he started shaking it (like with a tug-of-war toy) and two little squirrels escaped. He dropped the log and looked from one squirrel to the next in complete confusion. After a few seconds of this he picked up one of the squirrels and tried to stuff it back in the toy. Cutest thing I've seen him do yet. Then he got frustrated and distracted by the second squirrel that was also out of the log and tried to pick it up too (even though he already had one squirrel in his mouth). At this point I had finished reading the instructions (tips really) and realized that I was supposed to reward him for getting any squirrels out. I told him he was a good boy and tossed one of the loose squirrels across the room. He leaped up and bounded across the room after the other squirrel and then brought it back to me, happily wagging his tail. Now, no matter where I am in the house, if he gets a squirrel loose he has to come show it to me. He has such a look of pride on his happy face that it makes me laugh as I tell him he's a good boy. Silly dog.I took the advice from another reviewer and stuffed a few treats inside the log as well. Some of them just fall out with the other squirrels (I still haven't figured out how to make it harder for the darn things to fall out of the log) but a few stay in long enough to keep him distracted while I get dinner finished, or make sure the kids take their baths or fold a load of laundry.We love our puppy, but we love him even more when he has great toys that keep him busy while we get housework done. Thanks so much to everyone who reviewed this product, your reviews helped us make this purchase. And thanks to Kyjen for making a durable, fun and engaging toy!",dogs,3

"I love Angels' Eyes! This product works beautifully on my two Maltese's. When I rescued the my first dog, his eye stain problem was horrible.. I never thought I could clear it up. I purchased many products from the pet store. Nothing worked. Then I found Angels' Eyes. After just three weeks I saw a great improvement. I used it on him for only 6 months. To this day there are virtually no eye stains. He is a beautiful, very white dog.My new Maltese had a much more severe eye staining problem. I have been using it for more than 6 months. It is clearing up but not as quickly as with my first dog.I am extremely happy with the product. I am, however, disappointed that this new bottle of Angels' Eyes did not come with a measuring spoon.

"We tried three other kinds of dog door before we got our first staywell. We've now bought three of them (none of them have broken, we just have several dogs and foster from our animal shelter so we needed various sizes). They keep out drafts and rain much better than the other styles we tried (2 flexible flap doors and one rigid flap) because of the way the panels overlap. They are designed to be installed in a door, and the installation is very simple. Two of our doors are actually installed in our walls instead (a little harder, depending on your siding type, but still doable). The only downside is that the door makes a fairly loud clacking sound when a dog runs through and that makes it take a little longer to train timid dogs. I would strongly recommend these doors to anyone.",cats,2

"We bought this in hopes of shutting up our neighbor's neglected dogs so we could maybe enjoy our neighborhood again. We were kind of desperate since our complaints to the neighbor have been ignored.When the dogs are barking because they're bored the device works okay. We point it at them and press the button and they go running into their little dog house where they stay quiet for a good 15 minutes.However, when the dogs are barking at something good, say the other neighbor's cat or a squirrel, the device doesn't do anything at all. The dogs will look over at us for a second when we hit the button but then they go right back to barking again.This may work just fine as a training aid for your own dog, but using it on someone else's dogs sure doesn't work.",dogs,3

"This litter clumps pretty well most of the time, obsorbs odors very well and somehow seems to last longer than other litters I have tried.My only complaint is that it does throw quite a good bit of dust when filling the litter box. I was a little spoiled I guess, since the last bag of litter I bought here at Amazon had absolutely NO dust at all.It clumps well most of the time. Sometimes when I am scooping the box, the clumps with urine break up and fall through the sifter, while other clumps are hard and scoop right out without crumbling.I am not quite sure how or why, but this bag has seemed to last me longer than I expected and longer than it really should have based on previous experience with my cats' litter box usage.I have 2 female cats who use the same litter box. The odor control with this litter is wonderful, especially with it being an unscented litter. There are days I walk past the litter box and say to myself ""oops forgot to scoop it today"" but yet it has no odors at all. It is one of those things where if you don't smell it, you kinda forget about it - so since this litter works so well at odor control, I have to make a point to remind myself to scoop it so that the kitties aren't literally walking into a mess in their box, even though the odor is not present.Price (16 bucks) is adequate for quantity and performance and I would recommend this litter as long as you don't mind the dust cloud.",cats,2

"I have two dogs that shed a ton! Our akita/chow mix seems to have an endless amount of fur that I battle with year-round. We've actually gone through two vacuums cleaning up after her. Before the Furminator, I used a undercoat rake, a top coat brush, and my hands to deal with her hair; only to find that there would be just as much the next day. Now I can just use the Furminator and it does better than my three ""tools"" put together! The thing I love most is that it is able to get all her little leg hairs, which contribute a ridiculous amount to her shedding and I was only able to use my hands for it previously. It also works wonders on my black lab/blue heeler mix. I had recently brushed, bathed, and brushed him, then I used the Furminator and could not believe how much hair it removed! Plus, it makes their coats look clean, shiny, healthy, and beautiful! It has helped my lab's dry skin condition too.

But I still like these even tho I had to retrofit it for our kibble because it's small, cute, clean (you can flip it upside down and pop off the base to wash it periodically--good for the little ones), holds a LOT, easy to use, inexpensive, and made in the good old US of A!",dogs,3

"I worked in a large private pet store 16 years, and this brush was the best we carried. We used it on our own pets and ourselves. I also went to beauty school. Most human brushes have knobs on them which pulls and breaks the hair. I have long hair and all other brushes break it. This one gets the tangles out without breaking even the finest hair. Some people may find the brush sharp on the scalp at first, so make sure you are gentle at first. If you have a tender scalp, they do make a brush that has flattened pins, but they are not as good for your hair. I love it, because it stimulates the scalp. I find that after a while they are not as sharp or else I am immune to it.",dogs,3

"After looking at this for months, I finally got one. Surprisingly, in my experience, it did live up to its hype. We have a (very large) tabby, and like all cats, he sheds constantly. Brushing him with a normal brush took forever, wasn't his idea of a good time, and didn't really work much. We'd get handfuls of fur, but every time you'd pet him, little rafts of loose hair would go flying.When I first set to with the Furminator, I was a little disappointed, as it wasn't working much better than a standard brush. However, our cat didn't seem to mind the Furminator as much as his usual brush, so I just kept brushing. And more hair started to come out, then more, then still more. After a couple minutes of brushing, each stroke would give me a cotton-ball-sized puff of fur, and I kept getting that for a good fifteen minutes of grooming him. He did get sick of it eventually, but by that time we had a pile of fur about as big as him. I've kept doing it every other day since I got the Furminator a week ago, and every day I've been ending up with a softball-sized pile of fur.Overall, I'm really happy with my Furminator. The cat doesn't mind grooming sessions too much, and I'm amazed (and appalled) by the amount of loose fur I brush off of him. I'm also hopeful that I will see a reduction in his hairballs.",cats,2

I went to Petco and talked to their groomer, thinking I needed a new blade. The groomer advised me she uses Oster A5 Turbo, and has had the same problem.There is a part inside- she told me the name but I forget it. She said it was a $5 part, but that I would have to get it from someone who services clippers. I can't beleieve I paid $140 bucks for clippers that have been used less than 10 times, and they need a part already. So, now I'm looking for someone who services blades, so I can get this frikken part. I always thought Oster was supposed to be the cadillac of clippers.... NOT.",dogs,3

The squeaker is also wrapped in a mesh bag (as mentioned by other reviewers) so when she does eventually tear it apart she can't chew it into smaller pieces that can be swallowed and choked on. I have had geese that were torn up within hours, and geese that lasted for months. It seems that it's just kind of luck with each individual toy. I continue to buy it because even after Emma has done heart surgery on the thing she continues to love it and wants to play, and snuggle with it.

Now I've been adding 2 capsules and this seems to enlivened him even more.

"I researched this for a bit and finally decided to buy. I have a German Shepherd and she is energetic but does not get into things. She is very well behaved with food.I wasn't sure how I would like this from reading the reviews but I love it.The product holds the food and keeps it dry, no issues what so ever. The food goes inside and you have to lift the entire top off to get the food out. My do eats all her food when its feeging time. I take the top off, pour out her food and put the top back, then I fill her water dish. By the time it's her next feeding I do the same and there is not much water in her bowl, so spilling is not a problem.Keeping it clean by wiping it down is fast and simple.The plasic is sturdy and keeps the food inside dry. I read a review that the top rests on the food, this is not the case. When the top is on it rest properly and not on the food that is inside. I'm sure if you overfill it that may happen but not with me. I usually buy 40lb bags of food and I can empty about half the bag at a time.Very convenient and my dog never knocks it over, but my dog isn't trying to knock it over so thats something to consider. You know your dog. I'm sure if she wanted to get in there she would. It wouldn't be hard to do since it is lightweight enough.If eatting or drinking it's not too lightweight that it would move.Overall, had this for a few months now and I'm very pleased.",dogs,3

"I got this training collar after previously buying an off brand low quality collar, that did not help. I have two dogs, a German shepherd and a lab/pointer/blue tick healer mix. Both are extremely stubborn. I have been through many training classes and used different trainers just to get my dogs to learn to walk with a loose leash. Nothing I did worked. The day I received this collar (which shipped extremely fast!) I read the manual, watched the training video (I highly suggest watching it!) and began my training. I first worked on loose leash training and learning the command heel. Both dogs understood and did exactly as they were instructed. It only took a few minutes. And it was like a miracle. My lab mix had an issue with wanted to run away, or at least run a mile away and run back. I could never let him be off leash except at the dog park. Once he understood I was in control using the training collar, he has no need what so ever to run away! Now I never put him on a leash. This was all just in the first day of using this collar. And as for both collar and remote being waterproof, they both are without a doubt! I took them swimming in my pool and I had the remote around my neck the entire time and one of them had the collar on. It still worked while in the pool (I only used the beep), and still to this day works. This collar has been a miracle for myself and both my dogs. They are much happier being able to be off leash in my yard, off leash going for walks, and much more. If I even come close to touching the collar or remote when not in use they both get extremely excited because they know they get to go do something fun. I highly recommend this product!! The stimulation level goes up to 8, or higher if you choose. One dog uses level 3 and the other uses level 2.I you are new to using these training collars, WATCH THE VIDEO! It is extremely helpful!!",dogs,3
"I was a Veterinary Technician for 12 years and my Vets have recommended this food to me for my own dogs. The Vets I worked for don't sell dog food like a lot of Vets do and this is the food they fed their own personal dogs. My dog has been on it his entire life (10 years old), he was on the puppy formula as a pup, then adult formula from 1-8 years old, and now he's on the senior formula which adds Glucosamine/Chondroiton in the food. He truly is the picture of health. He's a Yellow Labrador and he's in remarkably great physical condition, he even jogs 5 miles a day with me every single day. I have never had any problems with this food and my dog loves it. I love their ingredients (Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Salmon, etc.) most of which is their first ingredients and their quality is second to none, can't beat it for the price.",dogs,3

"I have two 18 pound cats and a 13 pound dog/puppy. One of the cats loves drinking out of the faucet, so much that he's sitting at the door waiting for us to wake up in the morning so we can turn the faucet on in the bathroom!After setting up the product (piece of cake, just make sure you put the filter in the right way, which the instructions show you!), I filled it up to the brim with water and turned it on. The humming noise is about as loud as a typical Homedics fountain pump product -- almost relaxing, and not as loud as most people seem to think.The cats got used to the fountain rather quickly, but the puppy took a few days to appreciate it. Now both cats and the puppy are drinking from the fountain and not the bowl! The trickling sound of the fountain is louder than the pump noise, if that calms anyone's fears about how ""loud"" this fountain is.I found that by turning the little switch on the right down by the bowl base, the water level can reach a lower level before it starts making noise. I generally add about 8 ounces of water a day, because all 3 pets drink quite a bit. I'm going to buy the extra canister to hold twice as much water. I was gone camping for three days, and it was still running fine when I got back home.In terms of cleaning, I've had this product for nearly a month and am thinking about cleaning it now. As with any running water product, there's a film forming at the water level of the bowl. Once a month maintenance on this product, versus cleaning it every other day like I used to with a typical bowl, is fine with me!Great product, and not a bad price, either.",cats,2

"Personally, I think a 4 or 5 star review should be limited to exceptional items that far exceed their expectations and cost. While this is a solid product, it's it just ok.What's good about it is that it is solidly constructed. I've been walking my 65 lb Doberman with it for 4 months now and it has held up quite well. There are two main problems with it, though, that I can see.First off, it's a pain, and sometimes just impossible, to properly adjust it. I've been constantly adjusting it over the last 4 months and it never seems quite right. Sure, it looks fine when I first put it on, but after walking with the dog for awhile, it seems to lose its adjustments.This leads to the second problem--the leash coupler. You won't find out until you open the package and read the instructions that a normal leash coupler is not recommended as being too heavy. This is ironic when you consider the dog on the packaging is using a normal leash coupler, just like what I use. Still, I would venture that anything short of a piece of string would be too heavy, which wouldn't be acceptable for use with a 65lb Dobie!The problem is that pretty much any leash coupler is going to weigh down the front part of the harness, which holds the ring where the leash claps onto, causing the harness to sag in front. Maybe this is how they mean for the dog to stop pulling? On my dog, it sags so much that she looks like a rapper with baggie pants sagging down, restricting her movement.",dogs,3

"This was one of the first toys I ordered for my Westie, Brinkley, when I got him as a puppy. I had no worries about it, because of all the great reviews... I was quickly proven wrong. First, the toy itself shed CONSTANTLY, and EVERYWHERE. Shedding is a big deal to me, hence (a small part) of why I chose a very low-shedding Westie. Worse, was that as he played, and chewed on it, the its fur (especially the giant tail) would come off in clumps, so I had to literally hover over him to pick up clumps of fur (from the squirrel)that would fall, and pry out clumps that he'd get in his mouth and attempt to eat. It was heartbreaking taking this toy away, as he really did love it- and it did teach me a valuabe lesson- remove any large hair-like tails off toys before giving them to ""B"" in the future. Because no matter what, chewing on a tail/toy like that is going to cause problems, especially when they start to be ""mistaken"" as rope-like toys...then the problems get exponentially worse. It's a good product, and from what I could tell, it would've held up well, I just can't believe they'd use such cheap ""fur"" on a dog toy- you can just shake it and see the hairs fall off...",dogs,3

"I got a medium one for my 8 weeks chocolate lab puppy, and a large one for my 70 lbs lab/amstaff mix. I wish the large one would come in a narrower size too. The wide one looks a little bit weird on her neck, just because she has a wide chest going into wide neck going into smaller head... so there's no natural space for the collar to sit. It's not the collar's problem though :-) On my puppy, the collar looks just gorgeous. The pink perfectly fits her chocolate coat, and the collar looks just different than any other collars. People often ask ""what is that, where did you get it?"".The one missing star is for the name tag. Whatever pen you use, the info got actually slowly rubbed away. Maybe it was because my puppy was playing and wrestling with the big dog all the time? Also, eventually one name tag fell off during playing... it actually looks quiet pretty without the tag, because you can see the coat through the hole. So I took the other name tag out, and they just both have the classical, hanging tag. It works well like that.The collar is easy to put on and take off, easy to wash, doesn't smell, and it's very sturdy.

You must be VERY careful not to jerk the dog (or have them run to the end of the leash and get jerked back) as you could do serious damage to the dog's neck.

The DVD that's included has great instructions, and if you take your time teaching the dog to want to put their nose in that loop (offering many treats and much praise) you'll find it to be no problem at all. Be sure to watch that DVD and remember that the Gentle Leader is a teaching tool, and eventually should be faded away and not used again as the dog learns the proper way to walk with you.",dogs,3
"Our dog had continually barked out the window at cats, other dogs, squirrels, etc. and we had very little luck in stopping him. His barking was at a point that it was driving us insane and we were at our wit's end. We heard about these collars as a more ""humane"" alternative to shock collars and decided for $30 it was worth a try. It only took him barking with it on 2 times and the problem had stopped. The only negative is that he has figured out he can growl and the collar won't spray him. However, the growling is much more tolerable than the barking.",dogs,3

It did keep her attention a good bit the first day but, since then, she shows only occasional interest in the ball. I guess I'm not clear on how the treat-dispensing component of this ball works--or perhaps you have to use Kong brand treats.

I'm not sure how much better this carefree stuff does with preventing odors, but I like its feel better than wood shavings. It takes up more volume and seems more comfy for the gerbils. The color is nice (although you can see more poop in it haha) and when they mix cardboard into it it really stands out, but I'm definitely going to buy more when this lot runs out. Maybe in a different color though, like in confetti. Then when they mix other stuff into their bedding it won't be so noticeable.",bunny rabbit central,1

This pen was not what I expected. We bought this one because of the different ways you can configure this gate. We needed something you could make a rectangle. It was flimsy and we had to brace the sides with wood. We had a litter of little 2 lb. Maltipoos in it and they were able to push the sides out and move this pen. I would say if you are going to use it outside where you can use the stakes it would be fine but indoors might be a problem especially for someone with a bigger dog(s). Also trying to get the door open is hard because the entire pen moves but might be easier if again this pen was outside staked down. I would have returned this pen but we needed it right then.

With this collar, I never get the impression that my dog is in any pain or even discomfort (maybe that is just an illusion, there must be some discomfort) but he immediately became more responsive and obedient on lead.

"*DO NOT USE A TOP-SPOT TICK PRODUCT ON YOUR PET!* I don't like to use systemic chemicals on my dog and I absolutely will NOT use a top-spot treatment against ticks, so I use the Preventic collar as part of my anti-tick campaign.

I also doesn't leave any oily or powdery residue on my dog, and doesn't leave a bad chemical smell. I would give this collar 5-stars if it was completely ""natural"", but I'm still very thankful to get it at a good price because it is an effective and safer resource against ticks.

"Overall, this is a great cat tree. I would give it 5 stars if not for the incredibly horrible assembly instructions. I'll share some notes here from my own assembly process that hopefully some will find helpful.As for the cat tree itself...The construction of the parts seems solid and well thought-out. Assembly actually is easy (once you figure it out), you simply hand-assemble and can take any of it apart and put it back together again easily (nothing get fixed permanently as part of the assembly).It can be assembled with either side on left or right. In addition, you can have the two main pieces at an angle to each other, such as putting it in a corner or just having it not be flat against a wall. It's pretty easy to move the whole thing to another location, there is just one ""bridge"" connecting the two ""towers"" that is easy to disassemble to move the two main ""towers"" and then re-assemble. Shipping weight is 55lbs, so I'm guessing the bigger tower weights around 25lbs assembled and the smaller tower about 20lbs (with 5 for the tower and 5 for the packaging, just a guess), so that gives you a general idea of how heavy the main towers are.The ""beige"" color is more of a peach, almost an ""orange-ish"" hue. I wish it was more of a neutral beige, but whatever. The cloth covering is like a short fake fur, feels *very* soft and smooth. All of the posts are covered tightly in sisal rope. Overall seems good quality. This cat tree has a great variety of toys and surfaces, our two kittens love it. I think it's better than a lot of other cat trees that are taller but are just platform after platform on the way up, this cat tree is still plenty big and ultimately offers the best bang for the buck I could find.OK, the assembly instructions and process...The instructions at first seem like they will be pretty good -- a parts list, diagrams, step-by-step, etc. But then you start trying to match the parts to the parts list and follow the instructions. Parts don't really match the parts list (for example parts that are different are lumped together with the same part number, instructions don't specify). The diagrams are tiny and extremely blurry, they relay only a vague sense of what goes where. The labels on the diagrams are totally illegible. I called the manufacturer to get some help, and the number is no longer in service!I was bumming at the prospect of having to return this and order something else, but then I discovered the best aid for assembling this cat tree -- the image of it on Amazon.com! You can hover your cursor on the photo and get a magnified view of each section you are puzzling over. I found that ultimately this photo and the ability to zoom in answered all of my questions and I was able to assemble it.The parts list says you have 8 long sisal posts, all with the same part number, but actually you have 6 that are the same length and 2 that are slightly shorter. Of the 6 that are the same length, 4 have something heavy inside that slides up and down and 2 don't. Nowhere do the instructions explain which of these go where, it will just say ""attach a long sisal post to..."" For these, what you want to do is use the 4 that have something sliding around inside to be on the very bottom (so 2 on the left-side base and 2 on the right-side base). The 2 of these ""long"" posts that are slightly shorter are used between the 2nd and 3rd level of the larger ""tower"" -- in other words, they will end up surrounding the cloth ""cave"". This results in the 2nd level of the bigger ""tower"" being slightly shorter than the other, that's OK because you also have a couple of ""short"" posts that also are not the same size, you'll figure out here that they are designed that way so that the ""bridge"" will end up coming out level (look at the image on Amazon, you'll see what I'm talking about). It's fine as a design, it's just not explained at all in the instructions.The parts list also says you have 2 base platforms and 2 thru-post platforms. Coming out of the box it looks like you have 3 identical platforms and 1 larger. Huh? What goes where? Again the instructions don't specify. Here's what to do",cats,2
"Not all Amazon's fault as the product is very confusing with given size and then the 'expands to' size. This is correct that it is 3200 cu inch. However, I had purchased a very large package from a pet supply store and it was that size but then 'expands to 4.0 cu ft'. So I clicked on the product image to see which size this really was (already expanded vs. expands to larger). The image shows the same one I had purchased that expands to 4.0 cu ft. So I ordered 3 packs to get free super saver since the price here was about $4.00 less per package than at the pet supply store. However, when it arrived - it is the already expanded kind - As in - HALF the size of the one I thought I was ordering. This image is WRONG, it is NOT what you will recieve.That said, I called amazon and they did reimburse me 50% of my costs since I only got half as much product. I will not order it again as this is not a good deal - at least around here, since I got twice as much for only $4 more at the store. Very happy with the customer service to resolve this so I didn't have to go thru the annoyance of returning it for a full refund.",bunny rabbit central,1

Does not use much electricity, heats ageing joints and is small enough the cat can get away from in without leaving her bed when she is warm enough.

We tell her just to wait and in a couple of minutes she is all curled up on the heating pad. As she warms she stretches out and ends up with just her paws getting warm still. She is a 21 year olde Siamese with a great love of life, but stiff joints.",dogs,3

"I have a persian that is prone to getting matts in his fur, and a smart and feisty siamese who has not tolerated any other collar before, and was able to get most of them off. These super thin collars, however, have been working wonderfully. It doesn't seem to be matting my persian's fur nearly as badly (it still rubs a bit, but with the daily brushing and petting around the neck, it really isn't a problem) and my siamese can't tell that it's on her except for the tags jingling. I haven't seen her scratch at it at all.They were easy to adjust, not too loose and not too tight. They look great, and really do look more like a necklace than a tacky cat collar. I would recommend these to a normal cat collar any day.",cats,2

"I would have given this product one star, but I'm willing to admit that one of the things I don't like about it, being flushable, is simply my own personal choice. I tried this because I'm very particular about the litter box. I have 2 cats and I scoop our litter box twice a day and completely change it once a week. My husband suggest I try this litter after seeing a commercial for it. We decided that it would be more environmentally friendly and easier because it was flushable.The first thing I noticed is that I don't like flushing the litter. Thats just my personal opinion so I can't blame the litter for that. After about 2 days, and I was still scooping the litter twice a day during this time, the litter box began to smell...really smell. It didn't smell like cat waste, its hard to explain. I know its made of corn so I wasn't sure what to expect in the way of odor, but I wasn't expecting such a strong and offensive odor. I tried scooping it more often and that didn't help, I also tried putting baking soda in it but nothing made it any better. On day 3 my 9 year old son walked into the room while I was scooping and said ""woah, whats that noxious odor?"" From the mouth of babes...Also, it doesn't in my opinion, clump any better than regular litter, if anything I notice the clumps falling apart much more frequently. The one plus side is there's far less dust, but thats a very small plus side.I wouldn't suggest this product to anyone. I'm cutting my losses and switching back.",cats,2

This possibly happened because of the rains but I am not sure.,cats,2

"Worms are disgusting. One of our cats was starting to over-groom his belly to the point of baldness, we think because of the worms. The ""tape worm tabs"" required getting one tablet into each cat's mouth (a dangerous job but thankfully the tablets were small) and then within three days, the gross sesame-seeds were gone. A nice side effect of the pills was the total lethargy that our cats had for a day or two",cats,2
"After reseaching a number of raised feeders both in various stores and online, I purchased this particular one...I selected it because of both the material and the height. For the material, I'd read that some wood or laminate surface feeders tended to warp or become damaged over time from the water bowl. This one is all plastic so no risk of warping and it cleans very easily. For the height, I have an 85 lb. Old English Sheepdog so needed something to accommodate her size. This one is perfect. I use two ceramic bowls to make the whole thing heavier since she's such a big dog, and put a rug underneath it since she slobbers water quite a bit. She loves it, and her owner does too!",cats,2

"I originally purchased two of thePETCO Blue & White Kitty Crinkle Tunnels for my cats and wanted to get more tunnels for them so I decided to try these tunnels instead.They love these tunnels (I purchased four) along with two of thePet Supply Imports - Kitty Connector Tees I purchased.These tunnels are collapsible, lined, sturdy, have a larger circumferene to accommodate fat cats, and tie together with the connector tee or additional tunnels to make elaborate structures for your cats. My four cats took turns sleeping and playing in the tunnel so I decided to order two more tunnels today.I will tie them together in various configurations with each other or the connector tees to change up their environment and also move them around to different rooms. I will also combine them with the crinkle tunnels I have. The only thing the tunnel doesn't have are peep holes in the middle like the crinkle tunnels. However, if you buy the connector tee, there's a center hole in that they can look out of and they can also get out between each tunnel at the ""tie"" points becaue there is a slight separation there.This tunnel is the absolute best in my opinion and I certainly feel it was worth the extra money.",cats,2

"I use it for my cat to help prevent fleas. However he tends to run out and probably collect more adult fleas which I'm interested in killing/preventing infestation immediately. Keep in mind this medicine only kills flea eggs and does not work as immediately as the topical flea medicines.

She doesn't flake as much, her scratching greatly has lessened, her hair doesn't shed as much, and that icky ""dog smell"" isn't an issue anymore. The product leaves her coat very shiny and clean and there's no medicine smell like some products can leave. Very satisfied with this purchase overall.",dogs,3
This tube may have saved my life. My Australian Shepherd goes insane with excitement in the car and this is the only way I have found to keep him under control. He managed to get out of it by wiggling and pushing so much that the zippers came undone. I solved this by using trash bag ties to secure the zippers. Works like a charm. He goes into the tube willingly and behaves after the first minute or two. The tube is worth the price.,dogs,3
This gentle leader has been an absolute godsend. We got it for our five month old male German Shepherd. He was definitely a puller. He would pull my 12-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son whenever they would try to walk him. It was to the point where it was very unpleasant to try to walk him. After reading the high reviews and watching several videos on different types of head leaders we decided to go with the gentle leader. We are very pleased with this purchase. It only took our German Shepherd about a day to get used to it. The difference is like night and day. He never pulls now... it is so much more fun to walk him as he gently walks by your side.,dogs,3

"I LOVE this filter. The housing is transparent blue so you can see the filter baskets in side. I labled mine 1-4 (cascade 1200) to keep it easy. I am using this in a 55 Gal tank with the filter under cabinet. Tank has a medium bio load and is freshwater. ITS QUIET! no seriously quiet, the air pump is louder. After comparing many models and features the Cascade Series kept me coming back.SO FAR SO GOOD. People writing reviews saying their tank was &#34;crystal clear&#34; overnight? really? I didn't experience that dramatic of a difference yet... I say that because... Without an established colony of healthy bacteria in the filter you're just relying on the charcoal and floss pads. Filter has been running for a week now and NOW I am seeing a bigger improvement. The flow rate might not be what your expecting. Its not a garden hose output but its strong and my fish enjoy the current.THE PROS:PRICE $$$ no brainerCONSTRUCTION It feels tough and sturdy. Handle to take filter to sink is nice. Easy shut off valves. NO MESS.INSTALL. Take your time plan it out and its EASY. Be gentle its plastic after all... IE fittings.SILENT. Is it running? you sure? Check again. Love thisTHE CONS:BYPASS? Yes there is a small gap between filter basket and filter housing. I have started to see some debris collect in this area. Like others have stated before",fish aquatic pets,4
"I was so excited when we got this in and even though i tend to only give my baby ""new"" treats, etc. when she is close to finishing one or gets tired of the one she's had i couldn't hold myself (i mean who doesn't LOVE peanut-butter??!!) and i gave it to her right out the box.Unfortunately this turned out to be such a disappointment! She sniffed it and that was all folks..For a 7 month old Labrador Retriever that says a lot to me because my baby can chew through anything. We got through toys almost on a daily bases and then all her chew bones and raw hides don't tend to last as too long either.She has chewed on it a few times but i think its because its been laying around for so long its just something else in the house. I'm not quite sure what the outside part is made of either because it does not seem to be real raw hide.I would definitely not buy again and will not recommend.",dogs,3

"Although this model may be good in terms of dependability and cleaning efficiency, it is not quiet nor is it user-friendly in terms of maintenance. The old Whisper it was supposed to replace is better on both fronts. The pump on the AquaClear 70 could be quieter, and the water falls almost a couple of inches in the air before hitting the water-- and yes, the tank is full to half-inch from the top. I guess it was designed this way to promote aeration of the water, but it is noisy.",fish aquatic pets,4
"We needed to purchase a scooper for our back yard, so I went to Amazon to review the options. Both this product and the Sanitary Pooper Scooper received pretty positive reviews. I decided to buy them both so my girlfriend and I have something to do together (ha). This Wire Rack type is quite simple in design whereas the Sanitary Pooper Scooper is the crossed handle kind. I found that both work generally well. But, the Wire Rake one really impressed me. It is incredibly easy to use--just ""rake"" through the poop. The Sanitary model is more a grabber or clasper of the poop. The huge advantage goes to the Wire Rack if/when the poop is sort of down into the grass. The Sanitary model tends to chop up the poop, leaving gross half chunks behind. The Wire Rake style just easily slid through the grass and in the process smoothly picked up the poop. It even worked great in thicker and taller grass. Both do the job, but the Wire Rake was really impressive and deserves 5 stars. The Sanitary model is adequate, but deserves only 3 stars in my opinion. Also, the Sanitary model sort of feels a little bit cheapie, too, whereas the Wire Rake is quite sturdy and feels of a higher quality make. So, of the two links below, I would personally recommend going with the second link, the Wire Rake Scooper for Grass.Sanitary Pooper Scooper, RakeWire Rake Scooper for Grass",dogs,3

"This is basically a clear 15"" diameter plastic bowl with a hole in the center that is sized to slip over a 1"" O.D. Droll Yankees pole. There is a black plastic Collet Fastener installed in the bowl which is threaded allowing tightening of the bowl to keep it in place. It is suggested that the bowl be placed some 4' from the ground. This brings it fairly close to the feeders and the birds do bang into the bowl just as they do to a clear window. However since the bowl is installed with the large opening on the bottom the birds just slide off and continue on their way. I did not notice any sign of injury to the birds that collided with the bowl.This bowl is large enough to provide squirrel protection for the feeders if the squirrels are on the ground and want to climb the pole. Obiously it cannot protect against an airborne squirrel invasion. To protect against this type of squirrel ambush it would be necessary to purchase another bowl and install it above the feeder.This bowl is a pricey bit of plastic but it installs in a matter of seconds, does what it is designed to do and it is much easier than building a bowl on your own. The cardboard insert that came with the bowl does not indicate where it was manufactured. Hopefully, like some of the other Droll Yankees products, it is made in the USA.",birds,0
"I hear lots of good comments and lots of bad comments. I've had it for about 7 months, so here are my comments.- Top heavy, yes. I placed a folded town under it and the cat's don't push and pull or tip it over.- Inconsistent feeding and cats reaching up inside of it. The feeder has four paddle sections with six 1/4"" wide (I think) ""feathers"" to control portion size. With the bowl empty I manually turned the feeder (procedure is in the manual) on until the paddles lined up with the front and rear ends of the feed chute. I get pretty accurate feed sizes and the cats can't get past the feeder chute.- Hard to program. definately yes. keep the manual or trial by error. There is an on-off switch that resets the programming if you bugger up.- Food size. I use the small cat food 1/4"" diameter and less than 1/8"" thick. No problems, just have to trial and error to get the feeding size right. Don't trust the auto feeders 1/2 cup measurements.",cats,2

"I first put this thing in a 29 gallon tank and it barely fit end to end. Doesn't leave a lot of room for much more. Now I have a 55 gallon tank and it seems at home. One thing the photo doesn't show is that the ship is hollow on the interior, and the fish can swim all around and through it. The colors and texture of this thing is very good quality. Provides a lot of hiding spaces for the fish without obscuring your view of them entirely depending on how you place the two pieces. Only warning I have is that you need to be careful with the turret barrels as I have had one break off while cleaning my tank out one day. I intend on re-gluing it as soon as I find a safe way to do this. Some of the interior plastic is also apt to break should you be gripping it, but this isn't so important as you don't see these parts. All the fish I've had seem to love swimming in and around it, and that's why you get these things. Wish the company that makes this would do a variety of ships instead of just this one... I really like it.",fish aquatic pets,4

This brush works perfect for me. The bristle side works well and the brush is the same weight as a regular human hair brush. It was very easy & comfortable to manage. My pooch enjoyed the bonding time. She basically fell asleep in the first few minutes which is no small feat for a 1 year old pup. Haven't really used the pin side but I imagine it may come in handy in the winter when my puppy's hair usually grows longer & thicker.,dogs,3

"I absolutely love this system. I have a border collie and a jack russell and both are adapting very well. If you are patient and follow the training guidelines instead of rushing, it should work very well. If your dog does get scared of it, there is even a section on how to handle that in the training manual. As far as cost, minimal compared to the cost of installing a permanent fence plus the time and labor to install one. With this, you can change location and size. Another benefit for me is that, occasionally, I leave town for a couple of weeks and have to find a dog sitter. Now, I can just take my dogs and their collars to my friends home (she has the same system) and it just takes a few minutes to show the dogs the boundaries there. I never thought I'd be able to let the jack russell out without having to build a fence. Thank goodness I have discovered this system. I couldn't be happier.",dogs,3

"My cats went bonkers over the Panic Mouse when I first turned it on, but they quickly developed a tolerance to it. One cat now lies on the floor in front of it and passively whaps it when the mouse wand moves past him. Another cat sits still and allows the wand to ""pet"" him. A couple other cats quiver in the background and watch the wand spin around with eyes like pinwheels, but they do not interact with it, no matter how fast or slow I set the toy. Perhaps it is the loud whirring noise that puts them off.The Panic Mouse seems sturdy and relatively well made, so I don't plan to write it off just yet.

"Nupro addresses joint and skin issues from the inside out. It's a wonderful supplement we use regularly, along with Solid Gold's Sea Meal. It helps keep our dogs looking their best, for the many shows and events we attend. Their coats are shiny and healthier, which is the main reason we use it. My dogs are picky eaters. They will not readily take a powdered supplement, but I have found that Nupro is different. It is liver-flavored, and that makes a HUGE difference, at least from the dog's standpoint. My dogs don't like this in a wet or gravy form, so I have found that by adding just enough water (one or two tbsps), and stirring well, the powder will coat and stick to their kibble.

"I tried EVERYTHING with my schipperke-chihuahua mix... He was a rescue and as a puppy he had terrible separation anxiety. After I left the house he would whine, cry, bark, shake, and just stare out the window... it was terrible. I would be gone for a few hours at a time and he would whine (loudly) the ENTIRE time. I tried everything... The plug-ins scents, sprays, leaving a sweater for him to sleep on my scent, the doggie, puzzles, treat dispensers, Kong toys, etc. Nothing worked until I got this miracle toy! I smear peanut butter on the inner rim (or velveeta cheese) and then screw on the top so there it closes to about 1/4th of an inch. Then I leave it set it on the ground before I leave and he starts licking! It is WONDERFUL! The inner lip is curved so it keeps the sticky food inside (PB or cheese) and he has to wrap his paws around it in order to grab the disk to get the goods inside. Also, you can put other treats inside (it is kind of difficult to close if the treats are loose-which is why I use PB or cheese).My pup is now 3, so I've been using this for almost 2 1/2 years and I still love it! Now when I leave he doesn't shake and he actually gets excited when I grab the disk, unscrew it, and start to put the PB in it! Also, it is a really great routine that he has gotten use to, which I think helps a lot! I read up on separation anxiety (for dogs) a lot when he was a pup because it was SOOO difficult to leave him- first because I felt bad; second because I lived in an apartment and neighbors complained and I had only 2 weeks or they were not going to let me keep him. Thank the Lord I found this because it has worked great! I am not sure how well it would work with big dogs... It is made out of soft/medium rubber so larger dogs may break it.Lastly, it is dishwasher (TOP SHELF) safe :) Makes my life way easier! At the end of the week I just toss it onto the top rack of the dishwasher and its all clean! I mean, he usually licks it clean by the time I get home... but sometimes if I smear the PB toward the center it takes him some time to get to it and it dries out.I normally don't fill these kinds of things out... but I have now recommended this product to several people (even people in stores who are looking for things to keep their dogs busy) and tell them to look on Amazon for this because it is so great :) Try it!!!",dogs,3

This is a great hamster cage. I had purchased this cage for my hamster. Sadly I gave it to a friend because I thought I would like the Crittertrail extreme better. I was wrong. This cage is so easy to clean. It holds a large size hamster comfortably and doesn't take up all that much space. It helps with the hamsters natural instinct to burrow which super pet cages don't do. It has very few parts so its really easy to put together and clean. Its too bad that I had to spend a ton of money to go back to what I originally bought.,small animals,5
"this product is a bit pricey, and of course they continue to stick you for the refill cartridges, but it is worth every penny! i have one cat, and i literally only look at the litterbox every few weeks to a month. there is NO odor, and combined with the hood and a littermat, it is remarkably self contained. i honestly never dreamed that any product of this sort could be this low maintenance. you have to keep buying the refills though because once the moisture works its way into the tray, it becomes much less effective if you try to reuse it. my grandma and a friend bought the product after i got mine and both are very pleased with it. without a doubt i would recommend this product to all cat owners!",cats,2
"I wouldn't put Advantix on my dog again if you paid me. READ ALL THE SEIZURE and DEATH REPORTS OUT THERE! I put one dose on my schnauzer and he ended up in the hospital for 5 days. Two minutes after I applied it, he was running around acting irritated. I immediately threw him in the tub and washed it off with Dawn dishwashing liquid. By the time I got done washing it off, both his ears had swollen with giant hematomas and he was acting disoriented. Rushed him to the Vet and they had to pump him full of charcoal to clear the toxin out of his system and he was very, very sick. There are so many reports of animal seizures and deaths due to Advantix, Advantage, and the cheap brands that the FDA held a special session on the injury reports . Bayer even reimburses people's vet bills when the product KILLS their animals. Big pharmacutical companies are not gonna let the FDA remove the products, so be smart and don't poison your pets.

"This collar completely changed our relationship with our miniature schnauzer puppy (10 months). Prior to purchasing the Dogtra collar, it was a constant battle when our dog was off leash. Even at the dog park he would wait by the door until someone would leave, sneak out, and run run run! I was always having to chase after him (which to him was a fun game), and to me was extremely frustrating and scary (I though he might get hit by a car). Also, our pup would NEVER come when called. Even if we threw a ""puppy party"" or offered his favorite treats, he would go the other direction. The last straw was one day when our little guy got out the front door and raced across the street. Our pup ran over to a group of children and one child was terrified. The child started running and our pup thought he wanted to play and chased after him. The child fell and hit his head on the asphalt! Fortunately the child was just fine, and the parents were understanding, but after this incident I knew we needed to find a new solution and fast.When I first received the collar in the mail I followed the procedures outlined on the Dogtra website:[...] (this information is NOT included with the collar, but I definitely recommend checking it out). Our little guy responded to a stimulation level of 20, by shaking his head and looking up. He quickly figured out that if he came when called he would not be ""nicked."" I also quickly discovered that the vibrating pager function is usually sufficient to get his attention. We only have to use the ""nick"" when in high distraction situations (other dogs, kids). SInce using the Dogtra collar (we have had it for almost 3 weeks now) our pup has not tried to run away from us once. I am now able to take him outside off leash and he comes when called.Not much more I can say-I am extremely pleased with this product and highly recommend it to dog owner's who have tried basic training methods (positive reinforcement) and are still not getting the level of response they need from their pup.",dogs,3

"I have used multiple types of litter boxes, and now have a new kitten in the house along with a 9yr old. The kitten took to it right away. The older cat has taken a little longer, due to the kitten using it and being used to her old one. Best thing about it was how easy it was to use, just roll it and dump it! I also use a litter locker to dump it into. It was so easy to use, I bought another one, and now both cats seem happy. Great investment for the money. I also have an automatic one, but they dont seem to use that one as much now, and the refill cartridges can be expensive. Only downside is one latch broke a few weeks after buying, but amazon replaced right away. Overall I would highly recommend this product!",cats,2

"This crate has made training my new puppy so much easier. Did a lot of research on crate training before I decided to try it. Highly recommend this item. My puppy loves to sleep in her crate for naps and night time. I also bought the bed pad to go in the bottom. Made her crate nice and cozy. The price was exceptional compared to all the local pet stores and other on line stores. For the crate and bottom liner, I saved over $60, plus no taxes or shipping which actually made my savings even more. My savings will buy a lot of puppy food. So glad I bought the crate.",dogs,3
"My newly acquired 50-lb dog consistently pulled just a little. She did not pull hard but I wanted her to leave some slack in the leash and decided to give the Gentle Leader a try.First, I found it VERY difficult to get the head collar on my long-haired dog so that it is tight enough. If it is not really tight, it twist around and, still worse, can slip off. The collar should have a way to attach it to the regular collar so that, if it comes off, the dog is not free to run off.After watching the DVD and trying the head collar in the house without problems, I tried it on a walk. The dog immediately crossed to my right side so that the leash wrapped around her neck, complicating the turning of her head. On the second walk, I kept her on my left side. She then tucked her chin to her chest (eliminating the leverage that turns the head around), leaned to her left, and braced her neck and shoulders against any pressure.I kept stopping to release the pressure and hug her and calm her down, but she'd launch herself against the leash right away. So there was almost constant pressure on her muzzle which is not helpful or desirable. We hurried back to the car.Using the Gentle Leader looked so simple! Foolproof! (As one of my professors used to say, ""But you don't know the quality of our fools!"") But it did not work well with my dog.Oddly enough, she now walks quite well on the leash wearing a plain wide leather collar. I think she recognized and fought any effective restraint but now relaxes and cooperates without it.",dogs,3

"I'll start off by saying that I REALLY wanted this to work, I was determined that i was going to love this ""pet containment system"". And for about 2 weeks, that was pretty much true. The boundaries are a bit inconsistent if you live on an uneven plot of land, and a couple of times the dog ran right through the invisible barrier (so i don't think she was corrected). But for the most part it did what it advertised, and kept my dog on the lawn and out of the street.Last night totally changed my mind.It was about 9:30 at night, we were in the living room (clearly within the boundaries) and the dog was still wearing the collar from playing outside earlier. I went and turned the Pet containment system OFF, and my dog started shrieking. She was being continually shocked, and it DID NOT stop after 30 seconds. She was frantically trying to get away from the pain, so it took some time to pin her down and get the collar off. Even after i had it off of her, I could still hear the thing zapping away. My husband unplugged the hub, and finally it stopped. I then spent the rest of the evening trying to coax the dog out from under the bed and back into the living room with sausage.I thought that since the hub was UNPLUGGED that would be the end of it, but no. Around 6AM, I woke up to a faint buzzing, beeping noise. I finally tracked down the noise, it was the collar, sitting on the kitchen counter, zapping away at nothing.After what happened in the living room last night I can't even get my dog to go outside to do her business, i can physically pick her up and put her outside, but she scrambles back to the door, trembling.i'm hoping after some time she will relax a little and not be afraid to go outside, but this is ridiculous!

"Our two standard poodles ruined two carpets in our house by throwing up after snacking on cat do-do. My husband and I were beside ourselves.

My husband was skeptical, particularly whether our older cat would take to it. Within a week, the cat and the two kittens were using it quite happily. It is amusing to watch them stand in line for the litter box. One waits outside while the other goes in. And we did not have the mess to clean up around the box either.We do put the litter box against the back wall, and then my husband puts another plastic bin in front of the litter box to keep the tallest poodle's head from reaching into the litter box. We have replaced the carpeting and hope we will not have to go to that expense again.Highly recommended for those who have the doggy snack issue.",cats,2

There really isn't much cushion to it and for that I give it a 3-star rating. It's ok, but not great quality, which I think the price reflects. Its ok for his cage but I am considering getting him a more quality bed from a different store for the downstairs of the house. It does it's job, but it's not fantastic in any way.

My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES this little treat dispenser! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.He played with the classic Kong once, but because to dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest.He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tired of it and goes back to the twist and treat.Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, is the perfect size for a toy dog.So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get this.

"This product works exactly as advertised, and on a very tough case. I cannot recommend this highly enough.We adopted a 6-year old hound dog rescue with absolutely no training on a leash; she was largely kept in a kennel and used as a breeding dog. Traditional leash training was not working, because she had never even learned to respond to her name and she had no sense that she needed to pay attention to the human she was with. She was all but impossible to walk. Even though she was only 50 pounds, after two weeks, I had developed a shoulder injury from walking her. That is when I thought I would try this product. I gave her lots of treats and praise when I first put on the collar, and although she did test it several times (try to bat it off her nose), she accepted it quickly.Because the collar redirected her head to me whenever she tried to pull, I found that working with her on this leash ALSO improved other skills. We started making progress on ""come"" and she began to learn that she needed to watch me to learn the rules of her new environment. Most of all, walks were no longer battles, and we both started to enjoy them. I could relax and walk without tensing for a lunge, and she no longer fought and choked against her collar. After one day, I was able to walk her with our other dog. Now SHE is the easier one to walk!The leash is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I thought the training guide was both clear and to the point. I do recommend letting the dog try the collar on once or twice before walking her with it. Give lots of praise and treats each time, and then she will accept it faster. Now, our hound gets excited when she sees the collar because she knows it means a walk.",dogs,3
This was expensive to me but it is worth every penney. You can't smell this even in the small room it is located at. Do yourself a favor and buy this and stay odor-free and cat-happy for a month at a time. Easy to change litter makes it a breeze.,cats,2
"Replaces a similar leash a dog chewed through. Not as good a fit on my hand as its predecessor, but it may fit someone else's hand better. I could do without the red logo, but this leash does the job. Also, I wish Flexi would go back to the cord style retractables for large dogs - I understand people hurt fingers on the cord leashes, but in twenty years of owning corded retractables, I somehow managed to not get fingers caught in a twisted cord. The cord retractables retract more quickly and reliably. But all in all this is a very good leash.",dogs,3
"I got this carrier to cart my cats to and from the vet's office on my bike or by walking. Of course they flip the heck out while in it, but they're cats and that's what they do. Here are my major issues with the backpack:1) The metal lining on the inside that gives the front structure and keeps the canvas off the animal constantly slips out of its ""holsters"". Basically, you have a bunch of metal wires in the bag that may or may not hit your animal. I wouldn't say it's terribly dangerous, but it would definitely be uncomfortable.2) This bag is NOT for large cats. I would say it can reasonably accommodate an animal up to 10lbs, and definitely not for long stretches of time. My 12lb cat has to sit upright in it, whereas my smaller 7lb cat can lie down. I do not have a small dog so I can't comment on how it is for dogs (I am reasonably sure my 50lb dog would not fit!).3) If you wear this as a backpack (and it has straps to do so, so I imagine it isn't out of the ordinary), be aware that the animal will basically be slammed around inside the backpack when you put it on or take it off. This may be especially pertinent to owners of delicate dogs or cowardly cats.I never use the wheels on this backpack so I can't comment where that is concerned, but as far as the quality of the bag, it seems pretty average. I have owned and used this bag lightly for five months, I do not fear that the straps will tear off due to weight, or that the bag will fall apart anytime soon. At the same time, I would never try to stress the bag to test its limits. It is well-ventilated and not terribly awkward to carry as a backpack.Overall, the carrier is useful if you just need to take your pooch or feline from point A to point B. Beyond that, I would definitely advise against keeping an animal in it for longer than what is absolutely necessary.",cats,2
This toy is very addictive to our cats. They absolutely love jumping and chasing after the cat dancer. It hold up incredibly well for being such a simple product...we have one that we purchased several years ago and it is still going strong. We purchased the second one for our foster cat who had to be quarantined in a separate room and couldn't share our other cat toys. It is a great way to keep your cats active and engaged. If ours ever wears out I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one.,cats,2

"I love this brush. My dog is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who is still a 6 month old puppy and already has a lot of long hair. I love the slicker part of the brush, although the surface of the brush is bigger than I thought it would be. I'm hoping as my dog gets older he will ""grow into it"". My favorite part of this brush is the smaller brushes included in the sides. I use the ""flea brush"" for his ears. His ears are long and when he eats he gets food particles in his fur and when he's outside he'll often get pieces of grass or mud in his ears. The little flea brush works wonders at removing these particles and his ears look so soft and smooth. Overall, great product. Just don't make the mistake I did by not looking at the dimensions so you will get the right size of brush for your needs.",dogs,3
"i have no complaints about this bed! it looks nice, is SO easy to assemble and clean, and my 95 lb. pit bull/boxer mix loves it (i ordered the large size)!!!the assembly was a little odd, in that the pieces don't really snap together or anything in the middle. of course, you have to leave the bolts loose until the very end and then tighten all of them, but it seemed initially that my dog's weight would make the bed cave inward because of how the middle bars connect. they just slide together (and apart, very easily). it has managed to stand up to my dog's weight, though, very well! and i put the bed together by myself in under ten minutes. it really isn't that difficult.i highly recommend this for any large dog. it's breezy, can be an in or outdoor bed, dirt sifts right through, and is easy to clean. as a plus, i received it VERY quickly. i love it!!!",cats,2

"I used it with my dog a couple dozen times, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. One time she managed to unscrew the bottom, and with that experience, she fixated on the bottom as the ""ultimate solution"" for the last morsels that weren't coming out from tilting and dropping the toy. She cracked through the hard plastic, breaking both the lid and the jug. The toy is advertised for ""heavy chewers"" but the container obviously doesn't hold up. I hope the store will offer a refund.",dogs,3

"My dog has a habit of only going to the bathroom when we're on a long walk and we pass by a house with the owners on the front porch, or in their front yard. This is especially awkward when I don't have a bag for clean-up. So I have tried every product out there for carrying rolls of bags...and this is the best. The plastic strap WILL break within a month or so of owning this product...so go ahead and buy cable ties in a matching color to resecure the container to your leash (it will no longer be removable...but I don't see why you would need to remove a bag container from a leash--unless you have a vast collection of leashes). I tried the fabric and velcro bag containers, and they break even sooner and fall apart. So go ahead, but this product--you won't regret it (as long as you also have the cable ties on hand).",dogs,3
"This feeder is Awesome! I figured out how to time it..that took a bit of time being that I am kind of slow. *hint* when youre up to the part where you're pressing ""mode"" button to go to the different time values such as minutes or hours, you'll see lastly the tiny number above it blinking. That number indicated the number of feedings so far (i.e. 1st feeding, 2nd feeding of the day, 3rd feeding, etc.) Anyway, that little number blinks. DON'T IGNORE THE LITTLE BLINKING NUMBER, this is IMPORTANT, it's the one factor that actually decides if the feeder will function at all, without entering a value here, it won't function. Press adjust once then you see 1 bar next to the tiny number blinking. This indicated the feeder will revolve once. Hit adjust again and that it will make it revolve twice when you feeds. That's the only thing that confused me at first. But I LOVE this thing. It fed my fish flawlessly for my 2 week vacation and continued to do so 2 weeks after i got home and I shut it off. My salt water wish looked happy and well nourished when I arried home, and I was so nervous for them when I left as I never used this kind of feeder or left my fish for that long alone. But the feeder worked %100, no need to fear. AWESOME!",fish aquatic pets,4
"This litter box is a vast improvement over my old traditional model. I recommend using it with crystals; they are much lighter so the box is easier to roll.My complaints:1) When rolling, fine clay litter will leak out of the seams. Switching to crystals negated this problem.2) The trap is narrow enough that sometimes big clay litter clumps would scrape the sides when sliding it out, making a gross mess to wipe up. Again, using non-clumping crystals negated this issue.3) The interior slats are too widely spaced, so sometimes the poop falls through with rest of the remaining litter.Overall I would recommend this litter box. It's much easier to use than a ""stoop & scoop"", and unlike a fancier motorized unit, you can easily clean it in a few minutes with a garden hose.",cats,2

"Our new kitten took to this mat pretty quick, the first time we brought her home from the adoption agency. She wanted to squeeze on top of a tool box on a shelf, but I calmly pulled her out and set her on top of this mat, and she's always used it as her bed ever since. So I'd say she loves it very much, and it gives me assurance that she'll be cuddled up and warm in the coming winter months.The item is pretty big for a standard cat carrier, so it'll go up the sides if you stuff it in a carrier, but not so much that it will block the upper air slots, so it's not a problem.The only thing was that I didn't care about the foil-like stuffing much -- with the dry cold weather here, it tends to accumulate some static. I accidentally gave our kitty quite a zap on her nose when I tried to touch her, and it gave her quite a scare. She's fine now, but I make sure I dis-charge myself before I touch her while she's on her mat.",cats,2

"I don't understand how anyone can say this isn't great litter... it has the best odor control of ANY litter I have used. I scoop everyday and I only change the litter because it becomes dust like after 2 weeks or so, it never smells like cat pee. Any other litter I have used cannot mask the smell of cat pee after 1-2 days. When I empty out the litter box I can put my face close to it and I still can't smell cat pee.. it is amazing.The only flaw is that it becomes dust like after time. If you have dark colored rugs or couches, you may see little paw prints from your cat. If you do not have dark rugs or furniture, it is well worth this one downfall!!",cats,2

"I bought all 3 of these products, the spray, the paste that they eat, and the room diffuser. My cat does not care for the spray, she won't go anywhere I spray it. As far as the room diffuser, I can't tell if that did anything for her or not, and it is not very strong like some reviews say, it has a light citrus/herbal scent. As far as the paste, my cat LOVES that stuff, she starts to meow and comes running when I get the tube out and I put it on my finger and she licks it right off, but again I don't know if it does anything to help calm her down. I bought all of these in preparation for moving to a new apartment and wanted to use them at the new place, I did plug in the diffuser on the first day and had been giving her some of the paste every night starting before the move. It took her a few days to get used to the new place but I think that was just her. So I dont know if these products really work.",cats,2
"My cat stopped using her box since late last summer. It's now almost May. We thought it was because of some crystallization found in her urine. We treated that with medicine from her doctor. She still went on the floor (right outside her box). I tried buying a new litterbox. I tried buying 2 boxes- one for her and one for her sister. I tried using a different kinds of litter (including World's Best and Feline Pine-which is awesome and I will eventually go back to). I tried using Feliway. Nothing ever changed. Eventually, I just gave up and bought puppy pads for the floor so it would be easier to clean up. I never thought that this stuff would work because the active ingredient is just ""natural herbs"", which to me translated to catnip and my cat couldn't care less about catnip.Finally, when I called the vet back to get a refill on her Prozac, a different doctor called back and suggested that I try this stuff. What the heck, right? I tried everything else. Originally, I just bought the additive and added it to the Feline Pine 'cause I just figured buying both their litter and the additive was a marketing ploy. She didn't respond to that, so I bought the actual Cat Attract litter and added the litter additive. She has used the litter box now ever since!!!I never write reviews. Even if I really love a product, I just forget. This stuff impressed me so much I had to let everyone know.",cats,2

After i did she has stopped.",dogs,3
"I bought the furminator after adopting a lab/shepard mix from a rescue group and found that just brushing her left her shedding all over the place. I bought this little tool and fell in love with it. It removes so much hair and the dog loves it. I also tried it on my parents two cats and they love it also. One will tolerate a wire brush but never near his stomach and chest, but with the furminator he starts purring after one or two strokes. Sometimes it was difficult to get his back and sides because he kept rolling over and wanted the furminator used on his chest and belly. The amount of hair that came off the cat was amazing, hopefully this will help reduce his shedding a bit.I do have to agree with other reviews I've seen and do the brushing outside where one can sweep up the hair, this is true more so with the dogs just because of the larger bodies but one probably wants to have a trash can nearby when even using the furminator on a cat, the amount of fur cleaned out of the undercoat is just astounding.",cats,2
"I've tried using this shampoo a few times on my short-medium haired cat hoping it'll get better, but for some reason the shampoo only makes my cat's coat worse. I used it on the backside of my cat, since he had some dandruff from not being able to reach his backside to bathe himself (that's what my vet told me), and it only made his fur ""gum"" up, become super matted, and left a greasy/sticky residue. A month after I had used the shampoo on him, I tried wiping his back with a damp paper towel (I was hoping his fur would get better eventually but it didn't. And I brushed him twice a week at least) and noticed a little bit of suds from the residue still being on his fur which is weird. His fur got so matted, I had to cut his fur with scissors because my Furminator brush couldn't comb through his fur which was all gummed up! I don't understand how people like this product, because it totally didn't work for me! I feel like you'd have to rinse your cat's fur with water after using this shampoo, which defeats the whole purpose of buying waterless shampoo.",cats,2

The rake would also spill just as much litter on the floor as the cats kicked up. Also the ramp did nothing to help with the litter mess, my cats just jumped over the side to avoid the ramp (but maybe your cat will like the ramp?). I've recently switched to using scoopable wheat kitty litter (swheatscoop.com).

Foster and Smith (online and catalog) or PetSmart, but I liked the idea of the 18 pack, since I now have three cats (lots more waste, since they like to ""compete"" in the litterbox).

Then there is a lot of constant SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK - of all her squeaky toys, these little squirrels are the squeakiest. Which she loves but I can only take so much of. I wouldn't leave her alone with the squirrels - they have lots of small parts (tail, ears, tuft of hair, whiskers, etc) that are easily ripped off by a persistent chewer. I could see them not lasting long if she was left alone with them for hours, and the small bits possibly becoming a choking hazard if torn off, so i give them to her for supervised play only. (this is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars). They seem to be holding up ok for now. Overall a great toy that really keeps her attention.

No smells if I change every 2 weeks and scoop daily. She hasn't had another urinary tract infection in months since I switched from Yesterday's News. Also, I give her a dose of antibiotics, Cipro, once a week as a preventive, but no subcutaneous fluids. I am very pleased with the litter, and love the free shipping with Amazon Prime.",cats,2

"I ordered the LRII and set it up today. I had a PetSafe Merry-go-Poop, what I called it, for three years, but it died last week for good. While the machine worked great, I was tired of dealing with the flaws in the product design. The worst part of the design was the sides were to small, and the actual ""go"" area of the machine was a little small, even for my cats. So I search online. I instantly crossed any of the rake machines off my list. That left me with a choice of the LRII, CatGenie, and another PetSafe. Both the LRII, and CatGenie had well above average reviews, with the LRII rating higher. Since are are moving in 2 months, I really did not want the hassle and cost of setting up the CatGenie twice. So I bit the bullet and bought the LRII. Since I knew that the LRII was elevated and that would be the biggest change for them. I elevated their standard box this past week. It assembled easily and is working properly right out of the box. I am thankful that they now have the lip on the hole as standard. I also left the plastic film over the control panel to prevent any issues regarding the over flow if somehow the miss. I will come back and update on how everything is going. Of course we are wanting to put an orange coat on it and post a picture with the cats ""OMG they pooped in Kenny""",cats,2

"I had an older basic version of the littermaid and it worked great for about 2 years. after it stopped working, I found I could not live without an automatic litter box, so headed off to the pet store to find another. There they had a new and improved elite version. New and improved, eh? The first one worked great, but if this was to be even better, how could I complain? Unfortunately, from the minute I bought this home, it was horrible. Instead of being better, it was much worse! The thinner, but metal tines seemed to break apart the poo more than before leaving many more little pieces that would not get picked up. Worse, the rake kept dropping the clumps between the box and waste box and they would pile up there and fall through the crack creating an enormous mess! We did discover that placing a long piece of duct tape over this crack helped a lot, but of course made changing the waste box more of a pain - as we had to undo the tape and re-tape, etc (it is only because of this tape solution that we found we could live with this box and hence 2 stars instead of 1). Basically, we went from checking the litter box every 3 days to having to check it once a day. After about 13 months, it finally broke - and I was happy - an excuse to buy the old model again!",cats,2

"Our vet suggested this stuff - you can buy it as a spray, which I also recommend for the cat carrier when it's time to go to the V-E-T. Our cats usually spend the ENTIRE car ride there yowling until our vet sprayed some of this in their carriers and on the way home they were completely quiet! (Miraculous!!!)We got this diffuser for our downstairs entryway which the cats apparently decided was a great place to randomly pee now and then. Now they only do it once in a blue moon (usually when we've returned from ""abandoning them"" by going on vacation for a week :P) This stuff has made a big difference in how calm they are and almost eliminated them peeing outside their litter box.",cats,2

"We chose this crate since it resembled the one our puppy was kept in by the shelter we picked her up from. She does love it, and feels secure in it. It's a good compromise between airy and den like.We purchased it on our way home from the shelter, and a surprisingly number of pet store employees recommended against it. They suggested all metal containers, to make cleaning easier. An all metal cage doesn't strike me as a homey den. So we didn't go with all metal.Cleaning has not been a problem with this crate. It easy to just spray it with a garden hose; shake it a little; and leave it face down to drain and dry. It can be dissabled also, if necessary.My one complaint, and it's a huge complaint by others as well, is the cheep clips that secure the top to the base. Our puppy has used the crate for 7 months now, and one of the clips is about shot. All the clips are cheep and hard to secure, but this one in particular has been the clip she has chosen to chew. A failure by any one of the five clips, renders the crate useless.I'm online looking for a new carrier, and would like to find a carrier similar to this one, but the cheep snapping side clips are a deal killer, since they are intended to hold the crate together. To the designer, may I suggest cheep spinning wingnuts, instead of cheep snapping clips.",dogs,3

"My little 5 pound Chihuahua loves these mini balls. I've purchased countless toys for him and I think these are probably his favorite. He absolutely loves chewing them and getting the squeaks.

"I have four cats ages 4, 4, 5 and 6 living with my husband and me in a one bedroom one bath condo. Our oldest would wake me up for his breakfast by jumping on and off the bed and purring loudly in my face earlier than my alarm clock and on weekends when I wanted to sleep in. Closing our bedroom door did not work b/c one of the youngest would sit outside and rattle the door and cry so I would just give in and feed them so I could grab a few more minutes of sleep. We bought four of these dishes so each can have their own because I did not trust the males to leave any left over for the female if we got the taller more expensive electronic feeder option available. I only bought it because we were leaving out of town for three days and were new to the area so did not know anyone close by to come feed them and check the litter box. Now I am so happy that they listen for the food bowl to feed them instead of jumping on me. I just have to remember what time I filled it so I can make sure it rotates and is not empty so they don't go back to associating me with putting out the food. We have it set on the six hour interval time and I use a half cup measuring cup and dry cat food. I fill three compartments with a half cup of food split between them and then do the other three. I use a weight control food and it only covers the bottom of the compartment so I think the meals keep them at a healthy weight and let me sleep through the night. Also no problems with any of the cats figuring how to break into it. They are patient for the next rotation. I had to assemble all four one week night about two days before our trip. I did not get how you just have to push down firmly to snap the lid down on the pegs but finally understood and luckily did not break anything. We have been about a month in on the six hour intervals and batteries are still going strong. I like that I can slide the food bowls under our queen sized bed during the day while we are not home and our landlord has our condo on the market so when realtors walk around the cat bowls are out of sight. At first the cats ran away from the sound and it was funny to watch them slink back to investigate with bodies low and ready to jump away with any sound or touch, but that only lasted the first couple of days. Now we watch them leap from their perches and run to the sound of their next meal.",cats,2

On the other hand, I was afraid that it may not work at all since it emits sounds at frequency I can't hear.I'm glad to say that it does ebb their bark after several pulses but it wasn't strong enough that it made them wince which makes me happy. I have to conclude that it is a good training device since I was able to change my dogs behavior by using this device and avoid ever have to smack their nose with a newspaper or anything like that.",dogs,3

"I had been looking for one of these as we have four dogs, three of which travel with us on various trips and errands. Many times they get thristy and we have to look for some place to stop or try to give them water in a bowl which would cause spill problems. The Gulpy Water Dispenser for Pets from Amazon was just the right answer and was able to order a three pack from Amazon at a very good price which came as always very quickly and our three wire fox terriers love them and can easily drink without any water spilling all over. I also am a avid hunter and I carry one with while out in the field for my Golden Retriever and myself. The only down side is they should of designed the screw in bottle to be standard with any plastic water bottles sold as they don't have the same tread size.I recommend this water dispenser to any one who has a pup.",cats,2
"Bought this to replace the small 8oz bottle we got with our rabbit cage. The larger size is a great improvement, and we love the spring retention band with the clips compared to the simple piece of stiff hooked wire on the old bottle.But there are a couple of annoying shortcomings:* Don't like the angle on the ""spout."" It's too wide or obtuse. If you hold the bottle flat against the outside of the cage, the end of the spout doesn't really reach inside the cage -- it's almost even with the side of the bottle! You have to insert the spout first and lever the bottle's top end which collapses the plastic a bit near the spout (see next complaint), so the bottle doesn't actually sit flat against the cage -- the top end angles away. This could be remedied with a slightly tighter bend in the spout, maybe 5 degrees more? I thought about heating it up and trying to do this myself, but would be afraid the metal would collapse at the bend, or the heat would distort the circumference and cause a leak around the ball or around the cap.* Plastic is very soft, causing it to collapse near the cap end where the cage bars compress it when the spring retainer pulls it tight. Again I think this is caused by the angle of the spout, which hits the cage bar underneath and applies pressure to this point when the retainer is attached. My concern is this crease in the plastic will eventually break through and leak.* Minor gripe with the little yellow floating duck that's supposed to serve as a water level indicator. It has a disk on the bottom presumably as a ballast to make it float upright, but it's not heavy enough. So ours looks like a dead duck, always floating on its side. Not really a problem, since the actual water line is more visible to me than the duck, but my wife thought it was a cute addition until it wouldn't float upright. You can remove the duck if you don't want it.As for those complaining of leakage, all such bottles like this I've seen will leak at first. You have to ""prime"" it after filling to get the vacuum to seal. After filling, hold it over the sink while you tap the ball several times. This releases some water and you'll see air bubbles rise in the bottle. After several taps it should seal and stop leaking. Problem is, again, due to the soft plastic and the angle of the spout, it's impossible to install on the cage without squeezing it, which inevitably causes some initial leakage into the cage. Have a napkin handy to catch the water while you re-prime. Once installed and primed, ours has never leaked.",bunny rabbit central,1
"We've become big fans of salmon oil. Our 14 lb. Bichon (white ""floofy"" dog) has serious skin problems which led to itching and hot spots. Premium dog food (without grains and artificial colors or fillers) and salmon oil have gone a loooooong way in making her days non-itchy.We've tried other brands and sizes of oil. I like that this oil has a more mild scent, has a pump that works very well (we keep ours on the fridge shelf and give a dose with each breakfast) and is the right size for a 14 lb. dog.

"My GSD was diagnosed with HD about 1.5 months ago and my vet recommended this, along with a Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM supplement. I give my dog three Duralactin pills a day, and I honestly believe this along with the other supplements, is actually working for him. He is running better, and for longer distances. He even seems to be jumping more. I like this supplement because it is natural and the active ingredient is dried milk protein. Unlike pain medicines, which can have ill-effects if taken for a long period of time, this medicine should not have any. I would recommend this for any dog that needs management of chronic inflammatory conditions. These pills have a nice vanilla scent to them, and my dog enjoys eating them with his food.",dogs,3

With the collar on and a full tank he will bark once, it will spray and he stops. Excellent. But after 5-10 minutes he forgets and will bark again once and stops. This happens over and over again and it seems the collar holds enough for maybe 10-12 sprays (?). So after an hour or so it's empty and away he goes on his barking spree.I wanted to go with this before trying a shock collar but I'm sure our neighbors are hating us. So we'll see how the shock collar works out.",dogs,3

I read the other reviews and purchased the medium size and it is the correct size. I have a 7 lb papillon - paps have long legs!

There is padding in the bottom for the dog and the the straps have a little padding also. The straps that connect to the carrier are reinforced and are adjustable.

I bought this cat litter at my supermarket. I thought the claims of the product to be odor free and entirely flushable were great reasons to give it a try. It does have a reduced odor - not odor free and is flushable. The material is very fine and a large quantity adheres to the cat's feet (and in the case of my very hairy cat - to the hairs on his back legs). There was litter all over my house after one cat's use of the box. Constant vacuuming - In addition - When you empty the cat box entirely you find that the litter has formed a cement like formation on the bottom of the box. It takes a lot of scraping and scrubbing to get it off. This was alarming because I had been flushing this stuff down the toilet. I only bought one box of the stuff which was good in theory but had too many negatives to continue using.,cats,2

"Cholodin seems to be working well for my 17 yr old Shep mix. She started with the excessive circling, pacing, and dazed moments about a year ago. I started this supplement about 2 months ago and she does not seem to be advancing in her Cognitive Disorder. In fact some days she is better than before. I did not start her on the recommended loading dose in fear of the side effects, so I chose to use 1/2 the recommended daily dose for 2 weeks and then upped her dose to the daily amount. I had used Anipryl for a month prior to this, but due to the cost of this med. for such a large dog I decided to try Cholodin. Grant you I did not have her on Anipryl nearly long enough to see long term effects, but I did not notice a change or a deteriation in her congnitive state from switching to Cholodin. She is not getting any worse at this point and this is good. I would recommend trying Cholodin for early signs of Canine Cognitive Disorder... I don't know how well it will work for advanced stages.",dogs,3
"I hate cleaning the litterbox, so after some careful consideration of my finances I figured a self-cleaning litter box would save me time, justifying the price of this device. I was wrong. Not only do you still have to change the disposable wastebags quite often and the disposable litter pan liner monthly (both being required purchases), but the litter pan liner is so poorly engineered that it doesn't fit the machine perfectly. Because of this, litter is constantly falling between the machine and the liner, and between the wastebag container and the opening it sits in, making you have to find some way of scooping out the difficult-to-pick-up litter from places that are inconvenient to reach with paper towels or brooms and dustpans. Add to this the fact that the rake constantly misses smaller pieces of clumped litter due to the spacing of the rake's teeth, and the fact that the rake doesn't even push all the used litter into the wastebag (thus causing the wastebin's cover to not always close properly) and you have a machine that takes more of your time to clean than it gives you time to do other things. With the addition of the required wastebag and litter pan liner purchases (which will occur monthly or so), and, of course, your regular litter purchases, you'll begin to see that this machine will cost you more money in the long run than your run-of-the-mill litter box and daily scoopings. On the plus side, because the litter is almost always clump-free, my cat enjoys using it more than the furniture. Does it justify the purchase? That depends on you and your cat. I'm glad he's not peeing on the couch anymore, but I could have spent that money elsewhere (like on a better-designed unit).Edit",dogs,3

Thank goodness the ball is in a track where it cannot pop out or I am sure it would be missing more often than not.My other cat is just sitting back watching, for now. What is interesting is that they are feral cats, truly out of the wild, and it took me years to get them to play with simple string and balls, purr, meow, and just trust me. Oddly, the one sitting back watching is the more outgoing of the two. So this is amazing that my shy little feral is the one who took to this right out of the box. He is sleeping by it right now.

"Good product. Works very well with my 2 large dogs. Amazon pricing can change by more than ten dollars per pack of 6.

"When I bought this roll, I have to admit I was very skeptical. I have a smalandsstovare and a very finicky german shepherd, and she hates everything. I've had a very difficult time getting her to eat any dry dog food, and I've tried them all. I bought this along with our first bag of Natural Balance lamb and rice dry food, and the results have astounded me! She ate the dry food immediately, and ate every bite, as did Tidas. An hour later, I decided to give the roll a try as a treat. The second I sliced into the roll, both dogs were pacing the kitchen. They ate it like I had just given them prime rib! I'm a new customer, and I will be a lifelong customer. The food smells good, the roll smells better than some of the summer sausage rolls I've bought at the holidays for people, and its an allergy formula. Win, win, win. If you have a fussy eater, or a dog with skin allergies, I strongly encourage you to give this a try.",dogs,3
"Great product.... my dachshunds love it and use it to climb down, too, instead of jumping off the bed...

When the steps are not there, they no longer even try to jump or climb of their own accord.",dogs,3

"My lab and I are extremely happy with her new Gripper Ball. She is 7 yrs. old and even though we still have it, needed a replacement for the first one. I must admit in her first year she did manage to chew the handle enough so that eventually we lost it but the ball was still easy to throw and she could hold on to it using the hole she created. Given her age I think the handle will last longer on this one. The first one stood up to the severe winters we have here in NY state because it gets left outside and sometimes gets buried in the snow banks for a spell. This is easy for her to grab and return. Because the first one has been her main ""go to"" ball I tried finding a replacement but was unable to find the same thing at the pet stores in my area. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon and received excellent service on my order. Would recommend this Gripper Ball for anyone who has a large sized dog who loves to play!",dogs,3
I bought this in the medium size for my two toy size dogs a few weeks ago. My new pomeranian puppy loves carrying it around even though it weighs more than him and he loves just chewing on it. It hasn't frayed and I haven't seen any strings around the apartment. I keep watching just incase (due to the other reviewers). They play tug with it once in awhile- the longer length was a better choice and it's easier for us to play tug with them without having to bend over too much. I can see why some of these dogs have destroyed these. The weaving is much more loose than some other tug toys and I had to really tighten the knots so they couldn't get them out as easily. I recommend if your dog isn't a destroyer!,dogs,3
This dog food is terrific. My dogs love it and it is very filling. They don't eat it all up really fast like with the cheaper brands. I have a greyhound and they have skin problems when they eat the wrong kinds of food. Not the case with this food.

"I lost my other dog repeller which BTW cost twice the price. After seeing this one and reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. Oila! It works just a good. It does not have a belt clip like my other model however it fits nicely into my pocket along with my cell phone and keys. It works best on ""spirited"" dogs not so great on those that just want a sniff of you. That's okay with me. I'm more concerned about the spirited ones that want to bite or are more aggressive with their playing. Good product for the price.",dogs,3

Overall though I would recommend!",dogs,3
"I don't necessarily recommend this cage, but not for quality problems. The cage itself is as to be expected. The problem lies in that it's far too small to give proper exercise room to any sort of guinea pig, ferret, or rabbit. Unless you intend to use it as a part-time cage part-time litter box, it's too small. If you intend to keep any of these animals in it full-time, you'll have an unhappy animal, plain and simple. There's not room for food, water, toys, hides, an animal, and still give them room to stretch and run about. If you want it for something smaller, say, a rat, consider a leveled, vertical cage instead. They like to climb.",small animals,5

"This has been a great buy. The plastic ""walls"" do not seem cheap at all, they are well molded and sturdy. I just wish I bought the taller version because my puppy is growing fast and is going to outgrow this shortly. I am hoping that we can have him trained to a point where he will know it's his spot and not try to jump out. This serves currently as our timeout/sleep area during the day in our living room, and he (an American Bulldog) is crate trained at night. I love that it's open and he is still involved in our lives and can see what's going on, and we know just where he is at all times.

"Ever since my daughter moved back in with us with her annoying little Pomeranian, we've had to deal with constant barking, especially whenever someone either leaves, or arrives at the house. The dog has been a constant headache. I've threatened to take the dog to the pound. Life has been miserable at our house. I've tried all types of dog collars that didn't work, and went through batteries by the box load. I was even tempted to have him de-barked. But finally, after years of frustration, I finally found this Pet Agree ultrasonic trainer. What an amazing piece of electronics. Now when he barks, I hit the button and he shuts right up. This thing really works. It even works through the sliding glass door when he's outside. Thanks for all the reviews before mine that helped convince me to buy this. It's a miracle.",dogs,3

"I just received safari flea comb with double row of teeth I am 100% happy that it really cleaned the fleas out of my cats fur. Yesterday my cat had an Oatmeal & Aloe Vera bath in the morning to relieve the allergies and itching from flea bites and I had used Revolution flea treatment to rid the fleas. Today I took a large bowl with very warm soapy water, paper towels and tooth picks; I combed the cat and at first I got about 14 fleas stuck in the comb, every time I swish the comb in the water solution, i wipe off the comb with the paper towel. when I finished I counted a total of over 50 fleas dead in the bowl of water. clean the comb with a tooth pick to get any stubborn dead fleas out and dried the comb., this took an hour of patients. The comb really does the job and then some. My cat is feeling better and enjoys being combed. He is going to get another Oatmeal & Aloe bathe (revolution is water proof once it is dried) The apartment got treated for the vermin and we all got relief from the bites.The Safari flea comb should be renamed the ""FLEAMINATOR"".Florida is the ""battle-of-the-flea"" state.",dogs,3

"I got this just under two years ago and it still works like new. I follow the recommended filter change about every month or so, and clean it during the filter change or as needed. Sometimes my cats hair will clog the filter and it takes extra time to clean it out all the way. The tube from the pump to the filter housing is especially hard to clean, although I think if I bought the recommended brush it might be easier. Everything comes apart really easy to make cleaning possible.I like that you can easily replace any part on it, and the large capacity water tank allows more time in between fill-ups. I still only fill it about half-way anyway, to make sure the water is as fresh as possible.The cats love the option to either drink straight from the fountain or from the pool at the bottom. One cat likes to stick her paw in the stream and drink from that!I can't imagine ever going back to a regular water bowl after having this!",cats,2
"I purchased this leash due to the reflective strip for dusk walks. I use it with a gentle leader so there is limited pulling on the clip. In the month I have owned it the clip has unhooked 3 times.

Found here on Amazon $ 20chewper than in stores. Works well. Was setting up new tank and have not had a tank in 10 years. Water chemistry was off at first but now seems fine.

"I wasn't expecting great success with this device (Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid) because from reading reviews it seems to depend on the individual dog as well as being fairly close to the dog. Two irritating fox terrier type dogs (not sure, but the kind with the curly hair which expands a little as if they have a beard) moved in next door and are compulsive barkers. It's clear they aren't open to become friendly because they get off on spasms of barking. The woman who owns them can't control them - she talks to them as if they were human. She need Cesar Milan the dog whisperer or something similar.Anyway the first time I went out back with the device they both started running toward me (no worry because there is a cyclone fence they can't get by). I pressed the button at between 10 and 15 feet distance and the lead dog made an instant u-turn trotting in the opposite direction. The other one though, is more compulsive and addicted to his little aggressive display. He seemed to be slightly uncomfortable and confused but kept up his rapid-fire barking and threat display.I keep the device on a table near the door and have got in the habit of taking it with me whenever I go out, especially to the backyard where these dogs have their fatuous reign over their territory. It became clear that the one dog is more sensitive than his brother and clearly surrenders at the sight of me by retreating through the dog-door into the house or running in the opposite direction. There was one time early on when I pressed the button as they were both headed toward me and they both made a u-turn running toward the opposite yard barking. Now I may be wrong but it seemed like they were kind of saving face, having to retreat but pretending that they were chasing something else. It may have been the sensitive one made a u-turn to avoid the sound and the more aggressive one instinctively followed barking. A couple of days into zapping them I purposely walked along the fence where the more aggressive one was hanging out. Again, he was able to overcome the discomfort from the sound and keep barking neurotically, although it wasn't clear from his reaction how uncomfortable he was.This morning one of them was out yipping and I zapped him through the screen door at about 15 feet. His yips tailed off with a plaintive sound and he made a beeline for the dog-door into the house. I'm not sure which one it was but I'm guessing that even the more aggressive one is being trained to know I represent a bad sound. I would rather they learned that the sound is coincident with their barking but for now it seems that they think it is just associated with me without any conditions. I'd rather have a friendly relationship - maybe they will learn to discriminate what the signal means (stop barking).",dogs,3
"This doesn't look like the exact collar I have (mine has a metal adjustment mechanism) but in general I can't recommend martingale collars highly enough. My dog walks very nicely on the leash but is sometimes fearful, so I wanted to keep her from slipping out of her collar in a scary situation without risking a correction that would be too harsh for her by using a choke or pinch collar. The collar is loose and comfortable as long as the dog isn't pulling, and when they do pull it tightens up enough to hold the head firmly in the collar but (if you've adjusted it correctly) not enough to choke them. When the dog stops pulling, the collar loosens immediately.I have also seen this used on dogs with sensitive skin who are irritated by choke and pinch collars.I bought my collar for an obedience class that required a ""training"" collar and was unsure whether this qualified. For anyone who's here for the same reason",dogs,3
"My chihuahua really loves these! I started offering him the smallest ones during puppyhood - he's now graduated to the middle size. Whenever he starts chewing on inappropriate items, I offer him chewable treats like these as a trade. The middle size Flossies last him a month or so, and I throw them when they are about 1.5"" only. When he gets bored with other toys or chew items, this is one he rarely turns down.",dogs,3
I think it's a great price. The only thing that I'm concerned about is that sometimes the hold button doesn't catch right away. It's like when you catch a fish and he runs with it. This concerns me because my dog weights 90lbs and I'm a little nervous when cars go by that one time it might not hold.,dogs,3

"My dog absolutely loves this toy. Just looking at it with the ball inside (touchable but unable to be chewed), we figured she would like it. We couldn't have guessed how much though. I brought it home last night and she played with it for over an hour straight. I took it away, then, so she'd have some down time (she was obsessively playing with it and wouldn't stop even for food). Today, I took it out again and it's been about 40 minutes straight that the toy has captivated her. She puts one foot in the hole to touch the ball and then takes it and chews to get at it. She also loves pushing balls like this around the house and this one is no exception. She is a touch chewer and destroys most of the toys she gets. This one has held up though (it is made of a really tough plastic). She has been able to put some teeth marks in it but even when she scratches it the plastic doesn't come off (so won't be swallowed -- I cut some of the scratched plastic off today before giving it to her again). I'm impressed how well this ball has held up given the workout she's been giving it (there aren't many toys she can't break). This is a great toy and well worth the money.",dogs,3

"I got this for my two female rats. because it was a good size and a great price! My rats love it, and it's bigger than I expected. For some reason I thought it would be smaller. But it's great for two rats at least according to the cage calculators. Since this is for bigger animals the bar spacing is a bit big, especially for two small females like I have. So this definitely wouldn't be good for small babies or rats that aren't full grown. And there was a small bag of Kaytee bedding along with a coupon in the cage which was very nice, especially since I happened to run out of bedding the other day. I'm not sure if it says in the desription that it comes with this but I didn't know so it was a nice surprise! So if you're looking for a good size cage for pretty cheap then this is great! It was easy to put together too.",small animals,5

"The Lentek Pet Paw, part of the Pet Chime system by Lentek, is a great idea that is badly engineered. Years ago, our dog was successfully trained to use the Pet Paw, despite the fact the only way to get it to work is to step on one little part of it, and even that often doesn't work. The Pet Paw often becomes dysfunctional when wet or frozen, because water can seep in around the edges of the part the dog has to step on. It must be kept in a plastic freezer bag to remain workable. The battery is hard to change because it is wedged in so tightly, and whenever there is a problem (which is often) the first thing we have to check is that battery. We have had to replace the Pet Paw many times. This product needs to be redesigned to be less cute and more functional. Stepping on ANY part of it should easily trigger the remote chime, and the top surface should be in a single piece that doesn't have cracks that water can enter.",dogs,3
"This was a replacement order for the exact same door that our three dogs used daily for 8 years. The failure was the flap split around a magnet, so it could not hold the magnet any longer.The door is mounted in our screen porch, so the dogs have to run through it every time they want to get into the back yard - which is a lot. I'm amazed the first one held up this long to 50-70 pound dogs banging into it, sometimes more than one at a time - one of our dogs is full charge ahead all the time.Mounting it is easy, it looks nice, it's easy to clean, it works well, and it lasts.

"My dog got a bone like this for Christmas several years ago, before we had kids, and she really liked it a lot. It lasted quite awhile, too. She is a 35 pound Australian Cattle dog that really likes to chew. Now that we have kids, I wanted to get something for the dog besides rawhide (because the little rawhide pieces kept getting left on the floor for the baby to pick up). The bone works great. The only drawback is that it is pretty sharp and scratchy after having been chewed on, so I have to make sure the kids don't toss it around or throw it on the leather couches. Other than that, I'm glad that it doesn't leave pieces all over the carpet, and that it is more interesting to my dog than a standard Nylabone. We also got the green one with the cylindrical center, and the dog likes that one, too.",dogs,3

"This product works well for keeping the major dirt off my seats. Makes going to dog beach possible again. It washes up in washer nice and never noticed the smell discussed in other reviews. The hook holes need to be strenghtened they look like they may tear soon. Easy to install and remove. I put a waterproof pad down under the area where the seat belt holes are, keeps sand out, I would rather not have the seatbelt holes, with 2 dogs not able to have someone sit in backseat with dogs anyway. The cover stays on well.1 thing I have a problem with is the hooks rubbed my leather seat at the top leaving a dark spot that won't come off. I now put a cloth under the hooks against the seat to prevent more of this. Would probably be fine with cloth seats but be aware when you install that this happens.2nd thing is the seat cover isn't quite long enough for my Avalon and the ends of my seats get real dirty. Seat cleaning by car wash didn't get it clean very well.Gave it a 4 because of the hook issue.",dogs,3
"My kittens love this perch. The Velcro attachment didn't last too long, but since I used the screws to anchor it down, it is awesome. The Velcro was a waste of time. If you have a wooden window sill go with screws right away. That was the only reason for only 4 stars.",cats,2

Just got this in the mail and it was everything we were hoping for! Until we installed it! Unfortunately With our 40 Breeder tank the side with the filter insert is just high enough for my girl to escape!!! so I sealed the hole with cardboard until I get some plastic. Another small problem I had with it was it has a maximum water limit that makes it too low for me to use my heater and a little low for my girl to swim (she's big) so I propped it up on one of the 89 cent stepping stones from the hardware store and now it is perfect!It was also VERY easy to install! It runs great compared to the side hanging fish filter we were using! And it has a hum of the motor running but it is very quiet compared to the other filters we have used for her!,fish aquatic pets,4
This product has saved the day n more than one occasion. Simply toss the affected item in the washer and Nature's Miracle and allow it to soak for a few hours. Then wash as normal.Also a great product if you've inadvertently allowed wet towels to sit too long.,cats,2
The pump got here really fast! I ordered it on Monday evening and it arrived on Friday morning. I had to order a replacement for my other one that broke but it was 3 years old and had a lot of use. The pump works great but the threads on the white piece that connects to the faucet can be easily stripped and is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. I upgraded to a metal one that I found at Home Depot and it works great. Other than that you will have no issues with this product. It is simple to use and it will assist you with draining a 55 gallon fish tank in as little as 10-15 minutes.,fish aquatic pets,4

"I got this package in the mail, and it had this in it. Well, I WAS thinking about it...but I really don't remember ordering it. I'm thinking my cat was clawing at my foot while I was sleeping, and I grabbed my phone and ordered this while still asleep! Well, it's sitting on the table waiting to be put on. But a friend of mine told me a vet needs to do it because the cat will move around too much, and/or bite them off before the glue can dry. So if I actually do this, I'm going to have to take her to the vet. This is the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.",cats,2
This is the second summer I bought Frontline for my dog. I works well. After about two weeks from the first application most of the flees are gone. Make sure you finish all three doses to make sure you kill all the eggs and remaining flees. If you dog is outside at all during the summer it is most likley they will get flees. I recommend this product cause it does what you need it to do without any mess.,dogs,3
"The website and the packaging say that this fits up to 14&#34;, but it does not. Fully extended, it will fit a maximum of a 12&#34;-13&#34; neck, and for a 12&#34; neck, it would be tight. For 12&#34; or larger, you need to order a Medium.",dogs,3
"I purchased my first Drinkwell Fountain over ten years ago. It worked perfectly every day until it finally died several weeks ago,I believed in the product, my cats loved it so i didn't consider another brand. I did take very good care of the fountain, taking it apart and washing it in hot water weekly.I ordered the exact fountain I had. I set it up and within a day I realized it was leaking. I checked all the parts filled it up and set it on my kitchen counter, it leaked. I was sure it was the result of damage in shipping so I sent it back and immediately ordered another one.Second Fountain comes and no leaks. I'm happy my cats are happy, all is well...not so fast. It's been a couple of weeks and yesterday I found it was leaking, badly. This time I wasn't checking it so I have some floor damage, fortunately not very much and that's not really the issue for me. I'm sending back the unit but now my cats do not have a fountain. I have some unhappy little furs. They have bowls of fresh water but have always gone to the fountain first.I'll go out and look for another brand but frankly I really liked the Drinkwell and I'm so sorry I wont have one.",cats,2

"My lab took to it the first night we put it out for her. It is well made. The question is; how much water to put into it? You have to experiment with that. In my case, it's filled to about a medium level. I can step on it and not have any worry about it bursting. It basically is a water bed for dogs but there are baffles in the mat so it isn't wavy at all. If your plans are to relocate it often, then it's just too heavy. Again, I have the large one. It is important to note that this mat should not be in direct sunlight. If it is, then it probably will get too hot to cool your dog. If you have a dedicated place for this mat, out of sunlight, this product works great.",dogs,3

Bought this in November. It never would get warm. Finally I disected it to find a faulty connection between one of the heating wires and one of the thermostats.

I noticed that the food was moldy, the second time I tried to feed it to my parrot. I definitely wouldn't recommend this food. I should have sent it back. Shame on me for not. I put it aside and didn't even think about it tillAmazon asked me to rate it. Never again!!!!!!!!!",birds,0

"This collar works great with my 75 pound chocolate lab. He's gotten to the point where he recognizes the collar and knows it means ""don't bark."" Every now and then I will hear him bark at night--usually only once and then he doesn't do it again. The batteries do stink--especially if you don't turn off the collar during the daytime. I only make my lab wear this at night, but I've talked to my stay at home mom neighbor and she says that she has never heard him barking during the day. Amazon sells duracell batteries for this collar under the subsribe and save program--so buy the batteries from Amazon--they last longer and are cheaper than the brand that comes with the collar.",dogs,3

"We've had the Cat Genie for about 9 months. I think it is wonderful. We have a diabetic cat who urinates a lot. Other automatic litter boxes didn't work as well and ended up being messy. The clumps were too big for the Litter Robot and the clumps would stick to the LitterMaid's rake.We've never had any problems with the Cat Genie clogging. The little white litter pellets are annoying and do end up all over the floor. I am willing to overlook that since it is much easier to sweep up the pellets than to scoop a smelly litter box.I'd also recommend the non-scented sani-solution. The scented sani-solution can be a bit strong.If you have a diabetic cat, the Cat Genie is definitely the way to go!",cats,2

"I always read and appreciate reviews before I purchase a product but this one had mixed points of view. I purchased the items and immediately tried them out of the box. I have a dyson so I really didn't expect to find too many hairs after running it, but I found it worked very well on pulling up the hairs that seem to weave themselves around the carpet fibers. We have a jack russell with short spiney hair and we also have a bernese mountain dog and a golden retriever .... this product did make it easier to remove hair from the furniture and the floor. ALSO, I did one section of the inside walls of our pool and loved it!! Later today, I'll use the rubber brush for the outdoor furniture and I expect good results. For under $20 I thought this was a great buy and I'm still thinking of other uses for both products.",cats,2
"While I can't vouch if this product actually removes odors as it advertises, I can guarantee that it's one of the worst smelling ""odor destroyer"" products out there. I sprayed one mist and my wife and I were gagging. If you have a strong stomach and don't mind the smell of terrible rotten eggs, than this product is great for you. I, on the other hand, could not stand the smell of this product for even a second! There is no way I could spray this on my carpet let alone let it near my nostrils. Of course this spray is going to cover your pets odors! It could cover the stench of a garbage dump with its powerful chemical aroma.",cats,2
"The laser just spins in a repeated circle. There is no randomness. My cats don't pay any attention to it. We end up using it like our old laser pointer and moving the laser around ourselves. So much for being a toy you can just set on the floor and let it to the work for you. Don't waste your money.PS -- One good thing about this -- is that the batteries last forever! I have not changed the batteries (almost 2 years) and it still works! The cats still use it, but only if we move the laser around ourselves. So... maybe it is worth the money?.... changing to 3 stars simply for battery life! SO much longer than the typical laser pointer!",cats,2

Driving with two beagles in the car (when they know they're going to the dog park!) can, at times, be extremely DANGEROUS! I found the product to be very sturdy and well made - no way those beagles would make their way to the front seat:) It was SO easy to put together and fit to my car (a crossover) like a glove. I appreciated that they customed a product to my car's make and model. . . . The first day Otis squirmed his way through the barrier - but, i just adjusted the panels. No problems since. . . .

Since she is a larger girl I was more comfortable with the other. It does seem like it would have been ok if I had not had experience with the other. It just made me a little nervous!

I am hoping to see far less hair on the furniture and on the corners. Be gentle - follow the directions to a 'T'. Thanks to a previous reviewer who recommended follow up with a flea comb. That gets the last of any stray hairs. If you have only a short hair, you will probably be surprised at the amount of undercoat it has. I certainly was! Take the time to use this comb and I think both you and your animal will be pleased.",cats,2

I'm too comfy to get up just yet.""We're rescuing a cocker mix this June and she'll get the same set up.The only thing that brings it down from 5 Starts is that it's a little expensive for canvas and foam.

I went out and purchased three different premium clumpable litters and none faired better.PS. Tent is not any better.

"I don't do reviews much.... but when I find an exceptional product, I just might go there.When spending good hard-earned $$ on things -- and expecting perfection from my expectations and/or needs.... I might be considered a bit finicky. Knowledge that I can't be alone in 'expectations' from a product', I'm happy to offer the occassional 'beyond-satisfaction' review. And when it comes to one's pet -- others in need of a similar item should hear from those of us HAPPY BEYOND EXPECTION.My kitty is 14, almost 15. She swallowed magnets as a kitten (NEVER put pics on fridges folks!!!!! The humidity curls the edges and kittens find them fair game for play. DO NOT learn the hard way as I did... in fact, tell your friends the same.)Due to the above nightmare, she can only eat approx 10-20 kibbles @ a time; any more and she'll get sick within 5 minutes. AND, she's constantly hungry.... to the point of begging (I can't blame her, I'd be hungry too esp if my intestines were ruined for life). So, for the last 14 years, I've fed her small amts of kibble every 20-30 minutes -- both before leaving for work and after arriving home in the evenings.Why it took me so long to get an automatic feeder?I didn't like what was out there -- too little feedings while I was gone // the top cover of the feeder moved rather than the bowl bottom (the pet had to make their way around the feeder rather than eat from the same direction) // the feeders were too easy to defeat and get to food stored for the next feeding (somewhat defeating the entire purpose) // and cost (although that never did nor will make a difference) --- but 2-3 feedings while I was gone and the 'too easy access to the rest of the day's feedings' didn't quite cut it for the $80+ pricetag of not-too-long-ago auto feeders. HAPPILY, automatic feeders have NOW found their evolutionary path!!!My decision was based upon the 'wildvet05' review found here. I had 2 feeders picked out... this one and another brand. Wildvet05 (and a few other reviewers) convinced me to purchase this one.There's 5 feedings; although 1 of these 5 feedings don't count in my world... I (and most likely you) can only use 4 of these feedings. Basically, the 5th is gobbled up as soon as it is placed into feeder bowl. So I've now got feedings @ 12 noon, 2pm, 4pm, and 6pm. I still use Sage's regular food plate for pre & post work feeding --- but I happily now live peacefully at work knowing that she's got 4 feedings while I'm gone during the day (and that she cannot get into the later feedings). I cannot begin to express my contentness AND my happiness in knowing that she's being well fed while I'm gone.Her behavior when I come home from work is so much more subdued now VS 'pre' the automatic feeder. Sure, she's hungry -- but she doesn't act as though I've starved her for the last 2 days. She is happy; I am BEYOND HAPPY!!And -- due to her age, and being the runt of her litter.... at almost 15, I've now started adding Tomlyn's Nutri-Cal for cats in 'every other feeding bowl' in addition to her Science Diet Sensitive Stomach kibble. She's only a wee 5.5 lbs --and although a senior, the Nutri-Cal is waaaay better than any 'senior supplement' ---- it helps to beef her up as opposed to the 'senior stuff' that otherwise trys to slim down older cats (my need, maybe not yours). And.... not only does it help to put on a bit of weight --- she AB LOVES the stuff!!!! It fills her up just as though I'd have given her a full bowl of 15 kibbles. She walks away content. It's basically as though the malty Nutri-Cal paste is a whole meal in and of itself (it can be given as a meal substitute for pets who cannot take food.... basically a meal supplement of sorts). I've given her enough of this Nutri-Cal where I actually believe that it also 'calms her tummy' after (or in-between) her kibble meals -- something that I never experienced with her before. I can actually feed her more often and not worry about her getting sick. It truly seems as though Sage is getting SO MUCH MORE from her feedings since I started with both the Nutri-Cal and this automatic feeder.So.... while exiting here with a babbling beginning, I end with --- this feeder IS BEYOND THE BEE'S KNEES!!!!! This feeder combined with both kibble and Nutri-Cal goes WAY BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS..... all while I'm gone and unavailable to feed my little girl who I love so much.Should you ever need a feeder for those times you're not at home..... THIS IS THE BEST FEEDER you will find",cats,2

"Hey guys! I just have this maltese dog that makes me crazy barking all day. I have tried everything from Cesar Millan's advise to training collars, to give him treats, you name it. My last option was this collar. I just could not believe the results! As soon as the dog got this collar on and barked, his reaction was phenomenal, he just jump back four steps and got silent! Ja! That was wonderful to watch! I get to the conclusion that I just cannot live without this collar! Finally we got peace at home and now he is a calm and silent dog. Thank God and this collar inventor! Amazon as usual gave great service I got it faster than I tought. Love Amazon.",dogs,3
"It's built we'll, but one major flaw....the hinges are fluid. So a dog can push the crate and change the shape of it. It would be great if the hinges locked in place",dogs,3
"I am very impressed with the durability of this toy rabbit. My dog has been unable to chew off the ears, tail, or even a hole in the toy. Excellent craftsmanship and design. My only complaint is that the squeaker didn't last long. But, I would buy this product again.",dogs,3
"My tough chewer (Blue Heeler) has been working on this toy for about two months. He unravels, un-stuffs, and generally destroys all other ""tough chewer"" toys, but this one is holding up. Yes, the edges are starting to fray, but it's to be expected after continual heavy use. The squeakers have held up though all of the chewing, and they weren't even obnoxious to begin with. Destructo dog and I both love this toy- and we're going to order more for our fur-friends xmas gifts!",dogs,3
"My cats love the DaBird toy and routinely destroy its attachments, so getting replacements is a must. The feather attachments are one of their favorites (the other favorite being the sparkler). The way these are designed, the feathers rotate as you swing it through the air, creating a flapping sounds very similar to a flying bird. It's that sound that has my cats running from wherever they were sleeping, and you can see pure hunting instinct in their eyes as they go nuts trying to catch the ""bird."" This toy definitely gets their attention. If they manage to catch it, they run off carrying it in their mouth looking as proud as if they have just caught a real bird. Sometimes they will hide it in a corner or kitty condo and guard their catch against the other cats.There are two weak points with it",cats,2
"Arrived in a jiffy. It took about 8 minutes to assemble. The accompanying mattress (4"") fits nicely. I bought two rectangular pillows from Ikea for each side. It is the favorite of our dogs. Has a place of importance in the family room. Easy to move to clean around it. I recommend the tan fitted sheet that sells with it...the white plushy cover is nice, but I bought a tan for an 8"" larger version of the mattress and it looks really nice. Tailored. The 8"" mattress is the best. Our 135 lb. Cane corso (Valentina) can sleep stretched out crosswise. This is the best mattress I have found for our big dogs for real support. I have heard Tempur Pedic makes a dog bed, but I'm guessing it costs more than these. I highly recommend the 8"" mattress AND the wrought iron bed with side pillows is really cute.",dogs,3
Easy to install with simple tools and relatively invisible in the yard. Doesn't drag on the dog's collar or get tangled like a tie-out on the ground. Safer for escape artists than a fenced yard alone.,dogs,3
These soccer balls were not all black on white like I wanted. They are cheaper than anything I have seen. They are dangerous because they are small but even my small dogs can choke because they are such cheap soft material they don't expell air like any I have seen so they stay small while playing and can lodge in their throat. The worst product I have gotten from Amazon.,dogs,3
"I have a 182-pound male Great Dane. After we moved into this house, he appointed himself guardian of the neighborhood and took issue with anything that happened outside. Nothing would deter him from barking. I began to worry that someone would complain about the noise. We're fairly new here and don't want to make a bad impression.I researched this unit and decided to give it a try. According to other comments and the Operating Guide that comes with it, I expected to achieve results slowly over a period of up to two weeks.But the first time he barked after I put it in place, he stopped right away. I've seen a complete change in his behavior. Now he's learned that he can bark a couple of times at a much lower volume, which I don't mind. It doesn't happen often, and the house is remarkably more quiet.I also installed the PetSafe outside device, and it has worked just as well.",dogs,3
"Feline Pine recently changed the formula to make it ""2x absorbent."" That also means it disintegrates twice as fast and now I have litter dust everywhere in my house. If you don't mind it in your bed, in the kitchen, on the furniture, and on your clothes, this litter is for you. It hides the odor better than any other litter - period.FYI, this is the second set of cats I'ved used Feline Pine with so I've been a customer for over 15 years. I just vacuumed yesterday and there's litter dust on my dresser, on the sofa and on the floor. I've bought my last bag of Feline Pine. What a shame.",cats,2
"All three of my cats like the taste of this toothpaste. It's easy to get them used to having their teeth brushed if you use one of the mini-toothbrushes, just take it very slowly and let them get used to having it touch their front teeth at first, then slowly start bringing the brush to their molars and pulling back gently on their mouth to expose the teeth a little. My cats figured out pretty quickly that I wanted them to open their mouth more and usually follow along because they like the taste.I have tried the seafood flavor as well, but my cats definitely prefer poultry flavor.",cats,2

"We have a 65 pound lab/husky mix. She manages to destroy soft toys, vinyl toys, rope toys, squeaker toys, chew bones...just about everything in under 20 minutes. (especially if left unsupervised) She has 3 of these large, red kong toys that have lasted for over a year! They are the best toys for large, aggressive chewers. The kong spray that you can purchase to spray inside the toy made our dog sick. We have since learned that many other brand-name treats also fit inside the toy if you squash it a little bit.",dogs,3
"I was hoping for better results from the barking collar. Although it seems to help a little, there are still times when the collar doesn't seem to startle my dog enough to get him to stop barking. I would not purchase it again, knowing what I know about it, and the cost of it.",dogs,3
"Great toy! It was an incredibly fun to to play with, my dog loved it and it was really great to watch. However, it did not hold up very well against an aggressive player and the tree trunk was quickly in pieces. The squirrels fared a little better and one has managed to avoid total destruction for over a week.",dogs,3
"From the moment i put the collar on it started to work, the dog tested it and got the first shock then she tried it again and she figured out what it was for. Now she whimpers real low to avoid the shock but no bark it works great.",dogs,3

"This is must-have item if you have hamster. And this item must used with vegetable oil to keep hamster inside. Otherwise hamster can climb the playpen very easily. The oil remains until you wash the playpen. As hamster grows, you might need a large wheel which is 8 Inch diameter.",small animals,5
I bought this as a gift for my friend's dog. She is a dasher and now my friend feels much safer when she lets her dog outside.,dogs,3
"I bought this after reading a number of reviews and recommendations. The product is easy to set up and the divider worked well for my growing Pit Bull puppy to get used to her &#34;den&#34; as she got bigger. She is now about 50lbs and I have taken the divider out, but she could grow quite a bit more and still be comfortable in this crate. I have not traveled with this product but I know it will be easy to move when I need to. It is also very nice having the side door, so I can place the crate against the wall in either direction and still have a handy exit.",dogs,3
"I have bad arthritis, so I wanted to start ordering the canned dog food instead of having to carry it from store. When I recieved the shipment, each and every can was dented, but in all random places. I felt like the company must have given Amazon all of the ones they knew they couldn't sell to the pet food chains. SO I won't order dog food again from Amazon.",dogs,3
"Our dog seems to want to bark when it is dark outside (like very early in the morning). We didn't want her to wake the neighbors so decided to try this. It worked great at first; stopped her in her tracks. However, the longer she wore it, the more she got used to it. It does still limit her barking somewhat, but not entirely. It does not take common batteries, so hard to find.",dogs,3
"We love this crate. It is important to have a crate with a replaceable shell like this one has. Also, if your dog tears a small hole in the screen, it is very easy to repair because you can take the cover off.I also like very much the fact that it is so easy to put up and down and the light weight of the crate is great for my back.",dogs,3
"Using these as training treats for our 7 month old Bernese Mountain Dog. He loves them, they are healthy snacks and they don't make a mess in my treat bag during training. Excellent product.",dogs,3

"From Size - sisal - seemed great! However, the product arrived with the wrong screws, I had to go to the hardware store to purchase something similar but they did not have ""flat head"" screws which you have to have so the Post will sit level on the floor. So it now ""rocks"" until I can find the right screws to put this together.I contacted Amazon's superb customer service who offered assistance on the matter. Just be warned that you may encounter the same problem with this manufacturers' packaging since I have seen others who posted reviews with a similar problem.",cats,2
The fabric seems very durable. I like how the top just slips around the headrests. My car seat isn't raised so I can't use the side hooks. But I did slip the thing that fits between the seat bottom and back all the way through and that seems to keep it in place just fine. The only issue I have noticed so far are the seatbelt slits are so wide that sand still goes through but the seat is still protected from mud. Easy enough to just wipe the sand off the seat.,dogs,3

"I held off reviewing this item until it was thoroughly tested by our cat. We've had it a little over two months now. I have to say, I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested. The crystal litter is amazing at controlling and nearly eliminating any odor. I added an odor eliminating air freshener just outside the room where we keep the litter box to ensure no odor escapes, but it is hardly needed. We have one cat that uses this litter box. We clean out the waste trap usually every four or five days and then we kinda shake the litter around in the box to disperse the unused crystal litter. One tray for our cat lasts a full month. The refills are a little pricey, but when you think of the convenience of not scooping daily (and the odor control) it is well worth the money. The litter box functions well, the rake has not jammed at all. The timer can be adjusted, but we leave it set to twenty minutes so the waste doesn't stick to the rake.If you have been thinking about ordering a self cleaning cat box for a while, this one is well worth the cost. I can't believe we waited as long as we did to get one. Highly recommended!",cats,2
"My [now 12 week old] miniature schnauzer loves this toy, but it did not last. Within one week, the [then 7 week old] puppy had ripped open the seam along the back of the toy, so we took the squeaker out so she wouldn't choke on it. She wasn't big enough to squeak it herself anyway. I've let her play with it a few more weeks, and she loves to chase and attack it, but I have to take it away now because there's too much stuffing coming out the top and back of the toy, where the seams ripped. There was never any rough play or tug-of-war with it. This is just clearly not a well made dog toy. It seems more like a child's stuffed animal that they just slapped an AKC endorsement on. I expected better quality.",dogs,3
"My cats love these and they are great for giving medication to cats. The only downfall is that they are very expensive. I've seen them sold in stores for as much as $11 a packet. If you give meds to your cats daily or twice daily like I do, this expense adds up all too quickly. Luckily, they are cheaper on Amazon (around $6 a package) but they are still too expensive for me.",cats,2

"Despite the positive reviews and my success with Capstar, I am disappointed in this. It failed to deliver any reduction in fleas as far as I can tell.One note, I was warned not to buy these online during the summer as apparently the heat can damage the medication during shipping. Perhaps that was the source of the problem? Regardless, it did not deliver.",dogs,3
I bought this toy for my 1 year old kitten Pix and she absolutely loves it. Her favorite is the original feather attachment that flutters like a real bird. She doesn't care too much about the other attachments but if I run around the house with them she will chase it until I get tired of running. The original attachment had to be replaced about 4 months later which is remarkable considering that some of her other toys only lasted all of 48 hours. Not unreasonable since all cats have teeth and most have claws. Pix and I give this 5 stars for being the best cat toy ever!,cats,2
This is a wonderful and sturdy bed. I got two for my two labs. They love laying on them. Highly recommend the fitted sheets. Even my cat likes to lay on them! Vey good quality.,dogs,3

"We bought this to &#34;kennel&#34; our Rotties in the kitchen. Our entry into the kitchen is 69&#34; wide. Although it is a bit flimsy in the middle, we have had no issues with the dogs breaking it. This gate is slightly higher than one we had purchased previously, therefore &#34;stepping&#34; over is not as easy (but still doable)",dogs,3
"The marketing of this product is exceptionally innovative. It is the same product, dispensed in multiple dosages at much less cost per month than the small monthly dosages.",dogs,3
"I originally liked this collar a lot because it did not chafe my Boxer's neck and it's attractive. But after two months the ring that one attaches the leash to bent and broke off. Now, I will say that my Boxer does pull a bit, but, she's only nine months old now and was seven months old when I got the collar, so she's not that strong; it's more like frolicking than pulling like a race horse. And, the return policy is that I have to pay for shipping and get only a partial credit so it's really not worth returning. For the price I do feel like Planet Dog should have a better return policy. But, I can use the collar for my dog when she's not on a leash, so that's good. So, it's a nice collar but didn't hold up to a large dogs antics.",dogs,3

"The litter itself is just fine, however, I only received one of three of the jugs I purchased. When I only got one box I assumed that the other two would be coming in a different box and used the litter (I know now to not do this as it is now Un-returnable). There doesn't seem to be a way to try to get the other two jugs of litter from Amazon, as that would be the best solution. Instead I have one very expensive jug of cat litter that seems to work fine. I'm dissapointed there is no way to remedy this.",cats,2

"I have always liked to get toys for my dog that stimulate his brain, rather than just the kind that he can chew on for hours and zone out. I'm not certain that this is incredibly important in the development of your dog, but I doubt it would cause any problems. The cube in this size is good for a smaller/medium dog (I have a pembroke welsh corgi, 6 months old, 24 pounds) but our larger dog simply can't fit her nose into the box to pull the toys out (large lab-type dog). For any dog in the medium-large size range, get the bigger cube. Overall, wonderful addition to the toy box.As a side note, we also have the bee hive and the squirrel tree, and he seems to like them all pretty much equally. The bees are really nice though, and I would recommend those as a compliment to this cube.",dogs,3
"The filter and filter media arrived in an unopened box and every piece was as it should be. The unit went together like a breeze. The instructions are simple and to-the-point. It works great!

I also make sure their perches vary in diameters from 1/2"" to 1"" but no larger to ensure their muscles in their little feet get the proper exercise to keep them healthy. My parakeets are 5 years old now and this soft swing has become their favorite place to perch. They also love to nibble on it so its soothing to them as well.",birds,0

It doesn't add protection, in my dogs case; for he loves to roll around in the stuff that gives him hives; grass! Zymox med shampoo, and zyrtec, or the generic brand, works fabuluosly. Zymox products are wonderful. I'm curious though, why most vets don't let you know how great they work, especially on a pet that needs relief right then.",cats,2

Although I think it is a great product, well made and very portable, my dog disagrees. He will lay in it for a short time when I coax him up, then quickly exits and lays elsewhere, usually in a spot that looks far less comfortable. May be a bit small for him (20 pounds), as he tends to splay out his legs when sleeping during warmer weather.",cats,2

"I got these for my kitty cat who liked to scratch at our couch and the carpet. Not only do they look adorable, but they'll save your furniture and items, assuming your kitty will leave them on. They are a bit of a pain to get on (we had to wrap our kitty in a blanket and stick out one paw at a time to do them) and they're time consuming also, until you get really good at it. She would bite her toes and pry them off one by one after a day or so, which would damage her claw in the process, so I had to replace them. If your kitty doesn't mind them, they're fantastic. If they won't leave them alone, they might not work out so well for you.",cats,2
"I'm so very pleased with this kibble and my cats are too.The size and the nutrional content is super for my active kittens. I've gone through one bag of Nature's Variety Instinct Grain Free Chicken Dry Cat Food with great fanfare. I was at my pet store when a rep from Nature's Variety was giving away samples. I got a tiny bag of Instinct Grain Free Rabbit Meal to bring home. It was so popular when I served it alone in a dish, I bought a larger bag last month. So far, so good!NV Instinct makes up the majority of my kitten's kibble food mix and I'll soon test my sample bag of Duck & and Turkey Meal formula. How nice to have all these great formulations.The company offes some excellent coupons by email.

They have Instinct Frozen Raw and canned wet. The frozen raw is a huge hit with my cats but the canned NV has never once been accepted.

"Capstar was a lifesaver for me and my dog. The fleas here get so bad! They are very hard to control especially in the summer time. I had given up hope until someone suggested capstar. I talked to the vet, and he said that capstar for some dogs could provide short term relief. So I tried Capstar and continued using Frontline Frontline Plus for Large dogs 45-88 Lbs 12 Dose like usual.The difference is almost night and day. Before the poor dog was just miserable with the fleas. And once they started to take over, there was almost no amount of bathing and frontline that could keep the nasty little bugs in check.Now, when the fleas start to become a problem, I give the dog a capstar and he usually feels pretty good and flea-free for about a week. Together with the frontline, we can make it through the summer without too many bugs.I would talk to the vet first, but I order Capstar on amazon because they are more affordable than at the vet and it is much more convenient.",dogs,3
"I've been using the spray on my two dogs' teeth for about 3 weeks. I cannot believe the difference! The older dog (7 yrs) had mild gingivitis which in my opinion is just about gone. The younger dog (2 1/2 yrs) had really bad breath and tartar on her teeth that looked like scale. After using the spray daily for about two weeks, her breath is no longer offensive. I was able to scrape some of the tartar off with a fingernail and now other teeth have white sections starting to show through. I only gave this 4 stars because I am waiting to see what my vet says when the older one goes for her annual exam in Aug. He told me she would need to have professional cleaning. If he says that is not necessary, then I will change the 4 to 5. I am very impressed with this product and will certainly continue this as part of our grooming regime.",cats,2

I mixed it in thier food, but some of the smaller dogs could still smell it and would eat very little, one of the bigger dogs, tried to eat all of the food, then threw it up. It did work, and I think my dogs are now worm free, but I probably will take them to the vet if there is a next time.",dogs,3
"I have an adopted pup named Puzzle--she's about the size of a collie (40-45 lbs) and the medium was a perfect size for her. She can &#34;nest&#34; in it and still have plenty of room to stretch if she wants to. She's a dark brown color (like a chocolate lab) and the khaki has been a great shade in hiding her dog hair from the average eye, and it's neutral enough to fit in with the decor without looking ugly. I haven't tried washing it yet so I can't review how well that will work, but I'm sure it will be fine. The best thing is that my husband and I don't have to kick her out of our bed at night anymore--she leaves willingly to go sleep in her new bed!",dogs,3
"I don't review many things, but this one I felt compelled. In the past, I've had two german shepherds and now I have a 75lb 3-year old mutt who grew way too fast. We started with regular ""x-large"" dog beds, but by the time she was two, she looked like a giant on a tiny bed - head and feet always flopping over the sides.This bed is HUGE! She fits comfortably, even large enough for her to bring her ""friends"" in and sleep with her. The height & firmness of the bolster is perfect for her big ol head and she loves being on her bed more than anything! She was in it before we could even get it out of the box, and we've easily trained her that that's home-base during meal times and when she gets her snack.Last thing",dogs,3
"My Drinkwell motor froze after a few years, so I needed a new pet fountain. My cat, Kona, absolutely loves drinking from a fountain and drinks more fresh water than when he has just a bowl of water. I purchased a Petmate Fresh Flow thinking a pet fountain is a pet fountain; this is not the case. The water in this fountain does NOT free flow; it essentially glides along a plastic runway. My cat stopped drinking as much water and would anxiously wait for the water dripping from my bathtub. So, Kona wins, I am giving up on this fountain (which is only a few months old) and buying a fountain which won't give Kona the plastic after-taste.",cats,2
This product is awesome. you have to be patient with your dogs because they don't like it at first. But once they get used to it and realize that they can still open their mouths it gets better. I have a coon hound who literally drags me down the street. Almost immediately (she had to get used to it) we were walking normally and both enjoying the walk. My 10 year old could even walk her without worry! I bought an additional one (the small) for my half cocker spaniel half beagle. Awesome product!,dogs,3
"I purchased two of these collars for my two Yorkshire Terriers who suffer from separation anxiety when I leave them alone. I was hoping that these collars would stop them from barking and disturbing my neighbors, but they did not. My dogs quickly learned that they could bark until the spray ran out, usually after about 12 sprays. The collars would also go off for no apparent reason, most likely confusing my dogs. I do not recommend this product, especially for stubborn dogs. I switched to the static collars as a last resort. The static collars have worked very well so far and my dogs were only shocked a couple of times before they figured it out. They are not as bad as people think they are. Don't buy the cheap brands found at Petsmart that are made in China, buy American like the ones made by Tri-tronics! The Tri-tronics Bark Limiter G3 is a great product. You can set the shock level and it records how many times your dog was shocked when you are not home. Now I can visually see how effective the collars are when I'm not at home.",dogs,3
"Hope this is helpful. To resolve cloudy water problems (if you have them)replace the standard filter media with a polishing pad and small bag of charcoal. Just cut a small piece of polishing pad (buy at pet store) and stick it in place of the standard filter media. This will get the water to pass though the filter media, not just over the top of it. Put a small mesh bag or charcoal (pet store) beside the polishing pad. This cleared up my cloudy water problems like night and day, and cheaply too. Be careful to change the polishing pad when it gets dirty as if the polishing pad fills up with debris the water might back up and it will then spill back into the aquarium. Great aquarium for the price.",fish aquatic pets,4

I would have liked it if the top connecter strap was also adjustable and I may cut and add a bit of elastic at the behind leg strap it gets tight when she lays down. She is a big dog so that happens. I had a harness that had elastic once for another pupper and it worked well there,dogs,3
"This collar works perfect. It stays perfectly clasped no matter how much my dog shakes her head. Best of all, it completely stops the barking when she wears it. My dog took to it straight away, others though might need some comforting like the manual suggests. I am very satisfied with how this product works. However, I have to get batteries already. I have been using it for about 2 months so maybe that's typical, depending on how much your dog barks, which mine is one.",dogs,3
"I've been buying treat-dispensing balls for DOGS for years, and they always cost more than this one. This one can be used for cats or dogs, especially because the hole size is adjustable for different size foods. It's easy to use and clean, too. It even comes with directions.",cats,2

"I have a 5 pound toy dog and the receiver is a bit large for him and the collar is too big, I wish it was smaller but, it does work and do what it is supposed to do. I purchased the collar for my dog because I live on a road that he could get hit if he wanders and recently he has ran from me playing in the direction of the road, so I wanted to teach him to never go there. I wouldn't buy this for a very tiny dog it is just too bulky and bothers the dog. I take the collar off when he is inside and not in danger because if not he looks like he has a weight around his neck and is miserable.",dogs,3
"The 15"" collar is actually only 14"" (including the string) around the OUTSIDE.It is 11.5"" if you measure the INSIDE (because of the spikes).So if you measure your dog's neck, and it's 14"", do NOT buy the 15"" Collar for him without the extensions.The extension, is a 3"" extension .This makes the 15"" collar (which is actually 11.5"") into a 17"" collar on the outside, and a 14"" collar on the INSIDE.Since my dog's neck is 14"" there is no ""pull room"". The collar is snug on his neck.I need to buy ANOTHER Extension to make it loose enough to give a good tug, or to put it over his head without pushing and shoving, and fearing scratching his eyes out.I know it says ""do not attempt to slide over dog's head"", but to link, and unlink these is hard to do. They need to make it easier to snap it on your dog, by having one link a Carabineer, or something. When your dog is moving around, getting the correct angle to un-snap those links is almost impossible. It also would need to be a bit longer to have the play you need to bend the joints.It IS also Plastic, and seems like it would wear down after a few months of daily snapping, and bending.It seems strong enough when it's new, but I now have to wait for more extensions. :(I give it 3 stars because the measurements are misleading.-added later --This collar is now our only collar we use. We had a leather collar, but he can slip out of it. The teeth on this catch his jaw, and he can not slip out of it. That is a good thing. But... It doesn't have the effect it's sold for. The dog still pulls like crazy when we walk him. I don't think the plastic teeth even phase him.The rope part should be longer, so you can get a good pull on collar. that may make it so it has more of an effect.He also realized if he pulls hard enough the links will pop, and he's FREE.We use this in combo with the remote shock collar, and are happy. He can't slip out of this, and the remote keeps him in line.But this collar does NOT stop him from pulling.",dogs,3

"Is the best if you are mechanically inclined. In other words, I got two of these babies (which let me add, work great). The only problem is after a couple months, it started to leak around the shaft seal...draining the tank. Fortunately it had been leaking for a few hours and we only lost a few gallons on the (oak wood) floor.The instructions do tell you about maintenance, but I wasn't ready for this!Vortex provides GREAT customer service and the quickly sent out replacement parts (while I was at it, got more earth and seals and grease, etc). I didn't want to send it back for warrantee because you know how that can be...Sooo...got the new seal in, and all was working well for about 2-3 days, when I noticed that when I turned the unit on, I had to twist the motor as it seemed like the motor was not lined up with the bearings (never did the bearings come out).Tech support told me to check it and I told them I didn't play with he bearings. As nice as they are, they couldn't help me.Soooo...in the mean time, the other unit started to leak and replaced the bearing seal(as by this time I have my own arsenal of parts just in case). This unit worked well and then started with the binding problems the first unit had.To make a real long story longer...i resorted to the last resort, and took the whole unit (motor) apart. NOTHING was binding, so I figured ""what could go wrong now"" so I put a little itty bitty touch of grease on the shaft and bearings and the unit works like new again.Just let me add, that when I tried ""tweaking"" the motor, you put an excess strain on the plastic impeller housing. Well...it cracked. Don't bother using ACETONE as the instructions tell you to do with small hairline cracks...it doesn't work. I ended up using JB weld, and laid the unit on its side until the epoxy set up and left if for 24 hours to make sure. ALL is well!Shall I make this story longer? OK...glad you said yes. Back to the shaft seal...If you order the seal, the manufacture sends you a ""very small"" plastic baggie with folded edges with a gasket shellac.Great idea, as all you need is a SMALL amount. But it took me a few weeks to get to this repair job that the sealer dried up...DOH! So I ordered more from the man and I have no clue what they did when they sent me a jar of it, and when I opened the small jar, there was nothing in it! Hummmm...Soooo....they did tell me what I thought it was, and the product you can use is (can I say this on the air???) PERMATEX Aviation Form-a-Gasket. Get the one with the small brush in the jar...not the spray, and do yourself a favor, not the super-duper high temp stuff...been there, done that. PERMATEX Aviation Form-a Gasket. It's brown smelly stuff that works great, and it's for wet applications. I've used it on head gaskets, valve cover gaskets, and it will hold the seal tight with minor leaks if you do develop one.Follow the instructions...a little goes a long way. More is not better. A nice even coat is all you need.Their online manual is pretty good. I have experience only with the XL, not the D-1, but I'm sure both motors are close in design and idiosyncrasies.So overall, I gave this unit (plus tech support) a two thumbs up for their time and and quality and will buy it again if I had to get another or recommend one. The maintenance is easy and fast, just be ready to maintain this unit like a fine piece of machinery and it's not for the faint hearted.Good price for this D-1 but as far as 180 and change....??? Hummm...highly unlikely. 100 bucks for the XL.If you need some help with this unit, please feel free to e-mail me and I'll try and help you. But do try the tech support first. They were great!",fish aquatic pets,4

"The squirrel lasted less than 48 hours. Generally the least expensive stuffed toys from pet stores last 3 to 4 months before the fabric rips. My dog likes to ""kill"" the toy, have someone throw it, retrieve it, play tug-of-war and start the process again. In a matter of minutes the fur was coming off. After the third or forth ""kill,"" stuffing was flying all over the living room. Never have I bought a toy that fell apart as quickly as did this squirrel. I will sew the rips and see if we can get another few hours of play as my dog really liked the toy.",dogs,3

I just want to say that even after a really good bath I applied this Frontline and it did not work on either of my pets and I applied it as the instructions stated.

"It's time to kiss $200 (and Litter Maid) goodbye.We bought one and it seemed to do the job so after a week we bought a second one. BIG MISTAKE.One machine broke and the rake just flopped around and couldn't scoop. We were able to get a replacement - but it is still in the carton - because the other litter box is always jamming. And they sent the wrong model (a cheaper one).One of our three cats tends to pee on one side of the box and the clump is getting stuck to the bottom of the pan. We can only imagine that the urine goes down the side of the pan, under the litter, and then clumps and sticks - constantly. We tried EVERY recommendation in reviews to try and stop the sticking.I will give the replacement box away and throw away the used one. Maybe the next owner's cat will pee right in the middle.It's back to the old-fangled poop and scoop box.",cats,2
"This item is probably best for dogs five pounds and under. it reduces the area of the wee wee pad with the frame, plus leaves some excess sticking out of the edge (depending on size of your wee wee pad).

They don't get much food that way, so it's not really a problem.

I've used various potions on my dogs' hot spots for years, everything from Bactine (which works fairly well) to vinegar w. a drop of Betadine (which also works but smells).

He didn't go crazy over this treat like he does with other healthy treats I found elsewhere.",cats,2
"I got this product over a year ago. At my old house I had it hooked up on its own not to toilet. It worked pretty good. It does miss scat, and cause it to breakup and add up over time. This caused it to flat out STINK every time it ran the cleaning cycle. since it was in the laundry room we could close the door and open the door to the garage and avoid that stank. So all in all I was happy with it.UNTIL....We moved to a new house. I had loaded it up into the truck. I was busy unloading furniture and so my girlfriend grabbed it and sat it in the garage. Unfortunately it got sat on the waste hose that's attached to the base. It cut it bad. I saw this maybe a few hours later and picked it up to look at it an the hose came completely apart. Great. I called cat genie and asked for a new hose. No go. I have to order a WHOLE NEW BASE. 200$ with shipping here to good ol' Alaska. I didn't have 200 dollars sitting around to throw at it for some time. Got my tax refund and my girlfriend drove me CRAZY about getting it fixed. Before you say ""that's because SHE was tired of cleaning cat pans!"" I am the one who cleans HER cats litter boxes. I finally broke down and ordered the new base. Got the new base VERY quickly. During nap time today I went to get it setup again...I have never seen a more disgusting litter box in all my LIFE! I had to dis assemble the old base to remove lots of parts for the new one.

"When we adopted two small shih-tzu puppies, we went to our local pet store and sampled a variety of puppy and adult canned foods. The biggest difference in puppy diets is that they are higher in fats and calories for high-energy fast growing puppies. Our puppies are not picky at all, so it wasn't like there was one they hated, but what we liked about this food was that had identifiable food chunks in it - duck, carrots, peas, etc, it wasn't too smelly, they have good solid poops with it, and they are growing quickly / happily on it! They've been eating it for three months now with no major issues, so it is our go-to food until they hit 1. We like it so much that I bought some of the adult food for our senior dog, and he is doing great on it - he has sensitive stomach issues, so not all canned or dried food digests well for him, but we've had no issues with this brand for him (Senior Plate, Turduckhen, Thanksgiving plate, etc).",dogs,3

"My dobe, Bear, has enjoyed Sam's Yams chews, cookies and bones since he was a puppy. Because Sam's Yams require more focused chewing than typical training treats, the chews, cookies and bones were integral in a training routine to encourage my rambunctious puppy to stay down and calm on our ""front porch"" as neighbors, kids on bikes and cars moved past. What began as training has become a ritual which is our favorite part of the day.Recently, at the advice of Bear's vet to address a chronic skin condition, I changed Bear's diet to a single novel protein source and eliminated all GMO ingredients. To that end, I contacted all of the vendors of Bear's treats including, of course, Sam's Yams. To our delight, Chef David and Sam's Yams sweet potato grower assured us that Sam's Yams do not contain any GMO ingredients. Happily, Bear's skin condition has resolved and he continues to be one of Sam's Yams greatest fans.",dogs,3
I purchased the Pet Tag Silencer as a gift for our son and daughter-in-law's dog. No more jingling tags at 4am! Now the dog can sleep in their room. Everyone's happy!,dogs,3
"It's very easy for my pup to get the treats out of this toy. They practically fall out and I have to use treats that are really large to make it harder for him to get out. The problem is, those treats are too large for my tiny min-chi pup to handle once he gets them out. Wish it had a smaller opening. Makes a good chew toy, though.",dogs,3
"I have a little dog who likes to mark in the house, so I bought this small male dog diaper and some liners from Simple Solutions. The elastic on this garment left a red welt and chafing on my dog's belly. I know the diaper's not too tight,since it's supposed to fit up to 13"" and my little guy is 11"" where he's getting sore. The liners are so small that you'd need x-ray vision to get them lined up right when your dog wears the diaper. I don't, so the fabric got wet, and totally defeated the purpose of having liners. I ended up using two at a time just to use them up. Ugh. My advice? Go on eBay and see how many people are out there making and selling male dog belly wraps that don't need liners. You can get several for the price of one Simple Solution male dog diaper and they're custom made!",dogs,3
"I love these pads. I have a house trained Yorkie, and he likes to drag things. I love these pads because they stay down with out marking the floor. I wish they still offered them in department stores, but i'm happy this site offers a discount if you buy more than one.",dogs,3
"These are great! My pup looooves them. Usually I give to her after exercising. It's her power bar!! Great quality, NOT from China, which I really appreciate. They are a perfect size (bite size), but sometimes I brake them in 2 pieces for training. I recommend for dog owners that like quality over quantity.",dogs,3
"Not only does this product do a great job of removing chlorine and chloramine, it also detoxifies ammonia and nitrite. I thought I had completed a good fishless cycle using household ammonia before I bought my fish. As it turned out, I had jumped the gun a little and my ammonia and nitrite levels started rising. The ammonia got up to around .5ppm and the nitrite levels went over 1ppm. I used a double-dose of Prime each day until the biological filter was able to catch up - about a week. I am happy to report that all of my fish survived and none of them ever showed any signs of ammonia or nitrite poisoning.",fish aquatic pets,4
"WOW, I got two of these and am so very impressed with the product. I've had them for around 6 weeks or more. They have not once tilted in the least, my cats can get a full stretch on them and whatever they are made of is wonderful. My older cat tends to get his claws hung up in the carpet ones and on this has never gotten a claw hung. If your thinking about it just DO IT, you'll love them oh and your kitties will too!",cats,2
This is the best purchase I have made for my puppies. And I am going to buy another one. It arrived quickly. It is made well. And the dogs immediatly like it. I have a 2nd home and make a long 9 hour drive about once a month. I feel so much better having something for them to ride in the car so they are not walking around panting getting car sick and distracting the driver not to mention saving my car from another deep detail. I put off buying this smart invention because I thought it was pricey. Turns out I dont know how I will ever do without one! I use it for both the car (easy install ) and the house as a bed. I will recommend this item to every animal lover I know.,dogs,3
"Ha! These are cool. Our cat is getting old and thus not as playful, but when we bring these out she gets frisky - especially when her claws grip the netted part she goes in attack mode. These mice get batted and nipped at and still holding up well after 6 months of use. She gets the most out of them when they land on smooth floor surfaces (non carpeted areas).",cats,2
"If you have a dog that just has to have the window open but you don't want him hanging out maybe catching a flying stone in the eye this is a super product.

"Quiet pump able to create loads of air pressure and bubbles! There are two air outputs with no way to shut off one of the two, so you need to have two hoses. Price was way below local pet stores. Packaged well and shipped quickly. Would highly recommend.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This was a huge hit immediately. Unfortunately, if left alone with the eggs, the dog that received this likes to make scrambled eggs. However, you can use any small toy in the pocket and your dog will still enjoy this.",dogs,3
"Although I dont gain the benefits of this product personally, I'd say that Dasiquin is a terrific product. I noticed that my dog has become more active (quicker to get up, and needs less stretching) since we've started giving it to him, and he loves the taste so much, he thinks its a treat.",dogs,3
"I have a German Shepherd and a American bull mix. I decided to switch from Taste of the Wild dog food to this Blue Buffalo weight management. My American bulldog mix was getting overweight and i wanted to help her shed a few pounds using this food since the TOTW is pretty high in fat.The countless positive reviews on petsmart and mostly good on amazon had me sold. I really wish i had tried a different food now. I noticed both dogs stool was a little soft when i was gradually changing them over. Which i didn't think much of. Once i completely switched them over, it was probably the first night i was awoken to one of my dogs having terrible diarrhea on my carpet. (which is a lovely aroma to wake up to) She also threw up a couple times that day and the next as well. So i took her to the vet and everything was normal, the vet gave her some meds just in case it was a stomach bug. The next day my Shepherd starting having the same terrible diarrhea and went in the house. The food is the only thing that has changed with my dogs so i really have no doubt it is what has caused all of the problems. I'm going to discontinue using this food immediately and probably go back to the TOTW. I would use this food with caution!",dogs,3
Would have been a perfect toy in the largest size. Would not recommend the small one for any dog except perhaps a toy-breed baby. It's just too small for safe play.,dogs,3
"I tried this product not really thinking it would work, but hoping. After trying all sorts of pain medication from the vet that made my pet very sick and never really helped his arthritis, I tried this and now he is flying around. I'm not saying that his arthritis is gone, I know it isn't, but he can go up and down stairs and runs with my other dogs. I'm not really sure how glucosamine works, but Quinny, my 11 year old dog, is much, much happier with his life now.",cats,2
"works surprisingly well! very fast! cleaned off thick,caked-on, red clay mud- even from around the toe nails- but with just a couple of plunges! towel- dried our paws afterwards, but sure beats every other method we have tried for effectiveness and ease of use! Sizes run large- we got medium for our boxers and it is more than big enough!",dogs,3
"Great product for short trips, one-dog homes, or dogs that don't eat much. I can put 8 cups of food in it, which between my small, medium, and large dog is only enough food for 2 days! Fun container, but I don't like that if I need one bowl for water, the other bowl and handle are no longer attached to the food and are thus much more likely to be misplaced.",cats,2
"This is a very cool toy for dogs to play with and learn. It took our Golden about 15 minutes to figure out how to get the squirrels out and she had a blast. We have started hiding her favorite ball (chuckit) in there under the squirrels so she has to dig them out one by one to get to it. Great Dog toy, although if your dog is a shredder I dont recommend it...",dogs,3
"I wanted a wooden dog house for my Shiba and decided on the Precision Outback. It was shipped via Amazon free super saver and arrived very quickly. The assembly was very straight forward, quick and easy. The structure seems solid and although the product has weather resistant coating, I applied some water sealant on the roofing and outside panels. I also put cut flooring tiles to fit under the dog house 'footing blocks' for additional wet proofing.This seems to be a well manufactured and excellent product.* * * added comment * * *After being outside in constant rainy weather for two days, a section of shingles on the back right side of the roof warped upward to form a hump. I secured them flush to the backing material with brass skrews. I suppose the roofing panel tolerances may be a bit tight and the constant damp weather caused the shingles to expand from the moisture past the point where they would stay flush.Again, I think this is an excellent product and my Shiba seems to like the 'secluded' corner inside the dog house created by the off-set doorway.",dogs,3
"This is advertised as a pet training alarm- not an &#34;oh yeah and an intruder alarm too&#34;- so I will treat it as such. First off, as I suspected, it is &#34;sonic&#34; meaning audible- not ultra-sonic meaning super high pitch that only the animals can hear. This was to stop two cats from climbing my Christmas tree btw. It does go off when they climb it- but all it does is bother me with an annoying tone. The cats don't even notice it. One is very skiddish and the ultra-sonic remote trainers make her jump and run, and at least gets the others attention- so they are manageable animals. I also have to shut it off at bedtime, because all it does is wake me up, and not deter the cats. This product is just a complete fail- if they had an ultra-sonic version- it would probably be great- effective on the animal, and not bother me every time it goes off.",dogs,3
I use this Outward Hound carrier when traveling with my doxie x toy poodle. He loves this sling and rides very comfortably inside it. He's about 13-14lbs and 11 inches tall at the shoulder; this provides sling a great fit for him.The sling has a center buckle which helps secure him in and there's a second clip for the collar as well. The little zipper pouch is a great place to store an emergency poop bag. There's even just enough room for a small blanket for warmth or extra cushioning. Made of very sturdy fabric that's been pretty resistant to hair or dirt.Other reviews have complained the should strap is not padded enough; I did not find this to be an issue.I've tried a few styles of slings and this one is the is the most functional. Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.,dogs,3
We have a jack russell terrier that loves to destroy even the strongest of toys. So many others have come home and been mutilated within minutes that I was almost to my breaking point. I couldn't find anything that would last for more than a day until I brought one of these home. We have 3 now and he loves to play with all of them. They have lasted for 6-8 months.,dogs,3
"My new little Chihuahua is a bundle of energy and he has managed to destroy one toy already. But not this one! This one is so well made, and I'm thrilled I choose this one because it helps my little angel get to sleep at night. I also bought the squirrel and he just loves it too! Of Course, my little Willow is not much bigger than either of these stuffed toys, but that doesn't stop him from carrying them around like they are nothing. The workmanship on these toys are of such great quality and durability, it's unbelievable! Even thought they are really great for puppies, they are also great for older dogs too!!!",dogs,3
"Great product for dogs with skin folds! Easy to use and works well. However, one bottle does not last long at all, so make sure to stock up!",dogs,3
I have been searching for anything that would work. I can stop looking now. This product is amazing. Even works great on the little short haired dog. Highly recommend it.,cats,2
"Currently my dog hates this brush and I can't use it much on her. It pulls her hair like an addition review mentioned on here. It does make here hair very nice when I can get her to let me brush one spot for long enough to get the naughts out (she is a toy poddle) I have know doubt that once I get her hair up to par that this will be a great brush, but if you haven't already been brushing your dogs hair everyday this may not be the brush for you.",cats,2
"My 70 pounder has plenty of room, actually too much! The bed bottom is very lofty. Sides are high. I was pleased. Although, I am thinking I should have gotten the smaller size since he wants to curl up in a ball in the winter time. I was hoping his new bed would deter him from wanting to sleep on the couch, but it hasn't.",dogs,3
"It took my 4 month old Westie a week to figure out how this toy worked, but now he can get most of the kibble out in about 10 mins. It is a great toy and it definitely keeps his attention. The one I have has an actual rope and not a rubber rope, so it has lasted. He has managed to chew off a few of the spikes on the rubber ball. Some end up on the floor and some in his tummy. I think the toy might be better if it didn't even have the spikes on it, so I wouldn't have to worry about him eating them. Overall it is a great toy and the jug seems very durable.",dogs,3
"I am a newby raising brine shrimp. I have a 100 gallon reef aquarium and wanted some live food for the critters. Hatching brine shrimp is easy, but raising them to maturity is throwing me.

Same thing happens with foods I have prepared from internet recipes, so I cannot put the blame on the OSI food.",fish aquatic pets,4
I have used Frontline for years and couldn't be happier with the results. If there are fleas in my house or on my dog - they are invisible. I loved getting this delivered to my door and getting it without paying S&H. Amazon.com makes life easier and saves money for all their customers - and I am one satisfied customer.,dogs,3

"These raving reviews make no sense to me. I have a pomeranian, and they shed a lot, and this tool does nothing. The only thing that makes this product ""worthwhile"" would be that it doesn't seem to hurt my dog. But very little hair comes off when you use it.I would just not buy this item. Not worth the price. At all.",cats,2
"Glad I was able to find these online for replacements to my cat scratcher. Could not find them in stores in my area. My cats really use the Turbo Scratcher and with three cats using it, I must change it often. The company shipped them quickly and I thought the price was very fair. Just a quick note to anyone who uses this scratcher. You can turn the disk over in the scratcher after the cats have used one side and get a second use out of the opposite side.",cats,2
I checked the reviews before I purchased. They warned me that it was too hard and the heat didn't last the night. I bought it anyway and sure enough they were right. At least I knew what I was getting into so I can't really complain. I wish there was something better. I use it outside so an electrical plug isn't an option (I'm afraid of electrocution or fire). This is the best option I could find at this time.,cats,2
"This litter box is alright, but if you dont have the tent/cabana that goes over the sides and top, litter gets EVERYWHERE. plus if you dont have something to set the litter box on top of, litter and small pieces of cat poop and pee will get underneath it, HOPE you dont have it on carpet in that case..PLUS if you cant handle the smell of cleaning a normal litter box, dont wait more than 3 days to clean this one, because rather than the smell being in the air, it is all contained in one box, so if you wait too long to change it, beware of the smell...i'm not too impressed with this product, its more of a hassle than anything..it is also VERY large, my bathroom is not big enough for my cat and myself to use the same bathroom.",cats,2
"My pup, Reilly, loves this toy and it's a guarenteed toy that will keep her occupied for awhile if I need get something done and she's been needy. She figured out quickly the concept that if she moves the ball around the room and runs it into walls and doors, she'll be able to get her treats out. I love using the ""Charlie Bear"" treats with it. I fill the ball up and let her go for it.",dogs,3
"I've had plenty of toys for my three lab mixes and none of them lasted this long. I was doubting that it would last even a day with my dogs since they have shredded every toy they've had in the past. It's rubbery toy and very flexible, making it hard for my dogs to find that certain spot would would enable them to tear it apart. My only complaint is that it gets very slimey with all the drool.",dogs,3
"Certainly a good purchase for our Labrador, she loves the bed. Stays much cooler than the air, and provides her with some comfort from the heat. The only thing I would say is don't move the bed too much after you have filled with water. Its heavy and the foam inside can bunch up. Overall certainly worth it and thinking about buying another!!",dogs,3
"We tried many products to help our dog with arthritis, but this is the only one that worked. We've been using this religiously for years using the maintenance dosage and swear by it. Our 12 1/2 year old Chow Chow acts like she is still young and energetic. No more lameness after two TPLO procedures earlier in her life. What a miracle and highly recommended.",dogs,3
"Like many other reviewers, I found this food dish to be alarmingly large even for my 20 lb rag doll cat. He took to it very quickly and after a week, we have no ants in the food. I have already emailed the manufacturer to suggest a smaller size. The feeder comes with approx. 6x6 inch bowls and are great for a dog but for cats could be more like 3x3 or 4x4 and take up less room. After 3 months, the ants have found the weak link in this product-- the injection hole at the center of the product in the middle of the divider between the bowls is open and the ants come under the bowls and up through the hole to FEAST on the cat food. the solution is to seal the hole---tape, silicone sealer, hot glue--a screw, but SEAL the hole. UPDATE Now two months later, the cat food is safe 24/7 outside. I put a small screw in the offending hole and if I keep water in the moat, the ants can only get the kibble the cat or the birds leave outside the bowl.",cats,2

"I am not 100% certain, but I believe this product caused some health problems with my 6 year-old Australian shepherd-border collie mix. My dog was perfectly healthy before I applied this product to his back, in accordance with the instructions on the box. Within 24 hours, he began acting very lethargic, which is highly unusual for him. Within three days, he began to limp noticeably. I could find nothing physically wrong with his foot or leg - it seems to be a joint problem, similar to arthritis. Most concerning was the raised red nodule that suddenly appeared on his belly (within one week of applying this product). I took him to the vet, who ran some tests but could not tell me for sure what it is. He suggesting having it surgically removed in case it's cancerous. So, my dog will have to undergo some painful surgery in a few days (and I will have to part with several hundred dollars to pay for it). Did Sergeant's Sentry Pro cause these problems? It would seem so. Needless to say, I will not use this product again.",dogs,3

These springs are great cats toys. They are large enough that a cat cannot accidentally swallow them but my cats love to carry them around the house. They also love to bat them across the room and pounce on them. These springs are a safe and inexpensive way to keep your cat or kitten entertained for hours.,cats,2
Don't see whats so great about it. I felt it was cheap. Just a wire. THe edge seems only 4 peices of cardboard. Was not able to make the cat interested. May be its me. Lots of people seem to like this. However we got the 301 cat bird catcher.Our Cat loves it.,cats,2

"I was looking for an alternate to the Kong toy because my miniature daschund can get the treats out of the kong very fast and then becomes bored quickly. This toy holds the treats in A LOT better since it has the tabs on the inside. However, the material isn't as durable as the kong. My dog has almost detached the tail and with the kong he doesn't even have teeth marks in it. I give it 4 starts just because of the material, I love this toy, but wish it was a little more indestructable.",dogs,3
One of my cats was getting chunky because he loves to sleep and hates the outdoors. I got him this to force him to get active and loose a little weight. It's been working wonderfully and his little pooch is starting to disappear. I'm starting to notice more muscle definition in his shoulders ad hips. YAY! My two cats play together to get the food out and it provides them with good 20 minutes of mental stimulation. The only downfall is that it gets kins of messy if you have food with crumbs. I have to sweep the floor after every meal. You probably don't want to use this on carpet it would get pretty gross pretty quick.,cats,2
I wanted to get away from plastic. I have 2 Shelties & wanted something large enough that I did not have to constantly fill. I do replace it daily because of the debris that accumulates from their saliva. It is a great size for 2 med/large dogs. I wish I ordered it sooner.,dogs,3

"Apparently, some disgruntled workers or rehabilitators did not like that the formula was changed and have gone on a smear campaign against Esbilac made by Pet-AG. They claim the FDA found this or that and that it was recalled etc... There is only a few sites which mention this and all the posts are done by anonymous people and they cite no sources or provide accurate facts.I called the FDA and they informed me they never opened any investigation against Pet-AG or Esbilac and that there was never any recall. I don't know what some people's intentions are when they spout this nonsense about it killing puppies or whatnot. Esbilac has been around for MANY YEARS. It is tried and true and every major pet store carries it and it is the number 1 selling milk replacer. Furthermore, even if you go on Pet-AG's site, they tell you that they have never had any products recalled and are being targeted on the internet by some small fringe activists. It's sad that they are trying to ruin a small company that provides a solid milk replacer meant to nurse pets.Back to the formula, it works great. I have nursed two pups using their formula and they grew up to be super healthy and strong. If your pup is rejected too early by it's mother, this is perfect for you to substitute with. I sometimes even gave my weaned puppy some of this and he lapped it up. It is also good for people who want to nurse other animals besides dogs.Please double-check if you are still cautious. The FDA never recalled it, and Esbilac is sold in every major pet-store and people who have used it, heap praise on it.",dogs,3

"I have been using Mendota slip leads for many years. The quality is superb, and they last for many years. This color is beautiful, feels soft from the very first use (though the leather will get softer). I have studied the Cesar Millan DVDs - it is quite easy to walk multiple dogs on slip leads without getting tripped up. The leather piece allows you to adjust the neck loop, and keep it small enough so that it won't just fall off the dog. The only problem that I have had with other than black Mendota leads is that the color from the leather bleeds if you wash it all in one piece, and there is no way to get that dye out. Each of my dogs has a different color lead - feels like a little party every time I walk them! I recommend watching some Cesar Millan videos as he demonstrates the use of the slip lead in many of them. I formerly used regular clip on leads and a collar, and had problems galore!",dogs,3

I had some Bissell OxyPro Pet...it may or may not have gotten out the urine marks, but left a giant dark (almost greasy looking) stain in it's place. Ordered the GET SERIOUS! from the manufacturer (didn't know Amazon carried it) and tried the GET SERIOUS! It totally got out the big, dark stains left by the Bissell. In one application.

That's a little misleading, because if you soak a stain the way the manufacturer instructs on the bottle, the cleaned area will not be dry in 3 minutes (and, to my way of thinking, unless foot-traffic can resume without risk of new stain being absorbed, you're not done.)",cats,2
"I opened the package, and like some others, I thought the fumes would bowl me over. I then expanded/opened the crate (kind of tough on the first side) and then stuck it outside for a couple of days (I bought the teeny one to take my cat to the vet). The smell wore off and now with my nose to it it smells kind of like a tent to me (a little cat tent for him to play in), the cat doesn't seem to mind the smell and his nose is way more sensitive than mine. He was enamored of it from the beginning. I put toys in it and he likes to hide in it and peek out at me. I have picked him up with him in it and zipped up and he seemed more curious than upset. I will try to remember to come back and post a review of how he did in the car and how it withstood the travel. But to date, it's getting 4 stars, only because I shouldn't have to air a product out before using it. I'd buy it again, though. :)Update 9/28/2012 a week ago, George took the fateful trip to the Vet to become a eunuch (he's available for any cat harems that need guarding)...he's recovered nicely and doesn't seem to miss his boy parts at all. (if you wonder if it calms them down, it DOES NOT!) back to the product, it has long since lost it's smell and George did very well in it on his trip to and from the vet's - he weighed in at 7 pounds when I took him to the vet and just a little bit less when I took him home and he did just fine coming and going. The netting is intact and he still likes to go in and out of it and occasionally chew on the corners. If you have a smallish pet, this should work fine.",dogs,3
"This product when used weekly reduced a severe shedding problem with our Golden Retriever by approximately 90%. Unfortunately, the tool is very expensive and become dull easily. The replacement blades are almost as expensive as the new tool and there is no way to resharpen them. Performance rated five stars, but price reduced my overall rating to four.",cats,2
"New Tiny Dog Grooming scissorsMy wife and I own and occasionally breed toy poodles. My wife does all the grooming most of the time.I thought that I'd surprise her with some new scissors. When these arrived yesterday, she immediately scooped up one of the toy poodles and went to trimming. She particularly likes the fact that Tiny Dog Grooming scissors you don't have to worry as much about poking them in the eyes. I did make the mistake of telling her how little they cost. I should have kept my mouth shut. They are comparable to much more expensive scissors in the cutlery shops. With what grooming costs around here they paid for themselves yesterday.If you groom dogs with scissors, I highly recommend this pair,Gunner, 2010",dogs,3

I use it as a water bowl for my kitten. Looks very classy (just like the picture). I haven't put it through any rigorous testing yet (like dishwasher or microwave) but will update if anything happens. Make sure you check the size though -- it's a little on the small size depending on what you might use it for.,cats,2
"This sure is a great little feeder!The bowls are stainless steel and each hold One Pint. Stamped as one pint on the bottom of each bowl.The bowls fit nicely into the molded black frame and are easily removable.It is very easy to keep clean and easy to take the bowls out for cleaning or adding pet food or to freshen water.It is has rubber type caps that fit over the legs so it will stay put on our tile type flooring. Works great!I measured it at 13"" wide, about 8"" deep and 4"" high.My pup is 6 months old and is short legged and this fits him just perfect. He use to have to stretch his neck way down to the floor to get to the bottom of the old bowl. He also use to take some of his dry kibble out of the old bowl and eat it off the floor. Not any more!!! He just stands there and gobbles his food down from this elevated feeder.Very Happy with this set! It should last for my little dog since he is just about as big as he will get now.It really is stylish too. Fits nicely into the kitchen decor in the black color and has the Reversible ""Side"" Panel inserts, that have the Stainless Look(kind of gray color on one side or the opposite side is beige color if you prefer. We like the black with the stainless look for the sides.It really is a nice product and Made in the USA!!!! Comes very nicely Packaged from the manufacturer too!I originally thought I wanted a nice Wood dog feeder, but I really am sold on this feeder! I really think it is oh so easy to keep clean and it always looks so clean! When I fill the bowls I lift the tray to the counter and it is so easy to use.Highly recommend!",cats,2
"This is the best grooming tool ever! I have two dogs that both have thick undercoats which shed constantly. I have tried numerous other brushes and rakes but this tool is a dream come true. If you have a dog that sheds like crazy, you know what I mean! This tool really gets the hair out and leaves the top coat nice and smooth. Neither of my dogs mind the tool and it is so easy to use. It seems to work best if you use long, fluid strokes. I have a Shiba Inu (similar to an Akita but smaller) and a Golden Retriever/Chow mix. I am so pleased with this tool and it is well-worth the money!",cats,2

"We bought this product about a month ago and we were looking for an inexpensive way to escort our cat for his yearly trip to the vet. We were in the market for something that was funcitonal, inexpensive, airline approved and wasn't too cutesy. This Delta travel bag filled each of those requirements. It works great in general, but I would have been happier if it had a plusher ""sherpa"" lining, and better windows. There are screens open/close over the windows, but when they are rolled up they still cover half the open window. I think this is pretty poor design, but again for our purposes - limited travel, it works just fine. I want to praise Amazon for its quick and free delivery and very compeitive price. Hope this helps.",cats,2
"I love how much bubbles it makes and how effective it is! It's pretty easy to use. The only downside is that, when you accidentally pull it out of the gravel, it's kinda hard to bury it down again unless you soak your hands inside the aquarium. Digging through the gravel just to bury this (again, especially when you just barely did a partial water change) sometimes makes the water so cloudy. But all in all, it's a great aerating disk! It doesn't bother my fish at all.",fish aquatic pets,4

"Our dog chewed at his upper legs constantly. The hair in these areas would stay matted and damp because he chewed so much. We had tried several products including oral medication from the vet. Nothing worked until we found this. We spray a small amount once a day on the hot spots and that controls the itching/scratching/chewing for 24 hours. When our dog sees the bottle, he rolls over in anticipation. It's inexpensive, easy to use and provides him with almost instantaneous relief. We have had no problem with side effects. It does have a distinctive smell, but we don't find it offensive.",dogs,3
"My four kittens loved it but they kept pulling it down on their heads as the security snap doesn't always work, the only time it did the elastic wrapped itself around the neck of my kitten, as cats do when scared she started twisting her body in circles trying to get it off, and running around the house only to make the elastic tighter around her neck, choking her. I was lucky I was there to catch her before she suffocated. Buttom line, I'd rather do without this toy than without my kitten.",cats,2

"Caring for fish in a very small bowl like this one is stressful both for the fish and the fishkeeper.In a small bowl like this, the fish's waste will build up rapidly (espcially since there is no filter). This causes suffering (for example, eye and skin irritation), sickness, and even death. You can try to prevent this by changing the water frequently; however, frequent water changes are also stressful for the fish. (Not to mention a pain for the fishkeeper!)In addition, the temperature of such a small volume of water will fluctuate rapidly; another source of stress for the fish. You cannot use a heater in a bowl this small.In particular, this bowl is *not* ideal for goldfish and bettas.Goldfish grow to be up to one foot long. Even when they are smaller, they produce a lot of waste. Goldfish need 10-20 gallons of water *each*, and they are schooling fish so you shouldn't have just one.Bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to 80F; there is no way to safely heat a tank smaller than 5 gallons.If you'd like to care for a fish, please read some of the excellent websites out there and learn all you can. (Ignore manufacturers websites, since of course they will say their products are great, even crummy products like this one.) Get the largest tank you can afford. If you can't afford a large enough tank, please don't get the fish.",fish aquatic pets,4

My dog used to keep getting into the cat box now with this new litter box the dog doesn't mess with it anymore. Plus my cat loves the new litter box! Less cat litter on the floor and little to no smell. Much better than any other litter box I've had.,cats,2
"I had used this litter on and off for a couple years without any real problems, like a lot of other reviewers. But - like several others - I have had insects come out of a box I have purchased. They are very small, white, and look like dust. But when you look closely, you see that the dust is moving and is actually alive! I first noticed them on the edges of one of the litter pans, so I dumped the litter and bleached the pan. I didn't suspect the insects were coming from the litter itself, so I refilled the pan with the Swheat Scoop. After a day or so, the bugs had spread to the other litter pans, and then I saw that they had spread to the floor because they were on the litter that the cats had kicked out onto the ground. They even spread to detergent bottles that had been set on the floor and were on the trash can and in the vacuum! Bleach, insecticide spray, soap...nothing worked! I had to hire a professional exterminator. He discovered that the source was indeed the Swheat Scoop because he checked the box that I had been using and found eggs and insects inside. He said they were a type of pantry pest that was feeding on the wheat.So - bottom line",cats,2

Cheap price ($5.39), but muzzle is very stiff (backpack type material)with somewhat rough seems. I had to guess at the size since it was not stated. I got an extra large because I have a Chow-Newfoundland mix. It is a little on the big side. I plan on just using it when my dog has to have his nails trimmed at vet (they ask for this). Since my dog is not a biter or chewer it works ok. However, if you have a dog that has to wear a muzzle for an extended period of time, is a biter or tries to get muzzles off, this is NOT the product you want to get.Note",cats,2

Apply it to the carpet, work it in with a SOFT BRISTLE brush, let it sit for a minute and put a towel over it (White is best) and stand on it to soak it up. Then fluff the area with a dry area of the towel. Usually, one application works. If it's bad, do it again. If it's really, really bad, do a third application and heat it up a bit in the microwave in a dish. (Not in the bottle!!) As I said, this stuff will get out the toughest pet urine stains, even dry ones. It works great on food stains , too. I have white carpet, so I feel like I have really put it to the test. Keep this stuff around all of the time!!!",cats,2

It does get stuck every once in a while, but if you simply walk in and rake a little yourself, it will finish the job. Our cats only took about 2 hours to get used to it. Other people complained that it is noisy, but it doesn't bother my wife or I. The only ""weird"" thing with it is that our younger cat loves it so much, you sometimes can find her sleeping in it!",cats,2

My mom said it lasted the longest of all the toys (the squeeker part). Once the dog did rip the squeeker out, the dog still loved playing with it. The dog played with this toy constantly once it was opened. It was annoyingly funny. It is a well-made product.",dogs,3
"We recently received notice from our neighbors that our two Labradors had been barking for extended periods of time during our absence. After the product was recommended to us by friends with a similar problem, we purchased three of the collars (one extra) and a 3 pack of refill cans.Unfortunately, the collar straps were narrow and loosened easily on our dogs, twice coming off, despite frequent tightening. Eventually we were able to utilize rubber bands to help secure the collars so that they remained on the dogs throughout the day. Not exactly what we wanted to do after spending more than $30 on a device.We prepared the collars as instructed and both worked properly when tested. We witnessed the device in action for the first time when one of the dogs began barking during a knock on the front door. Immediately upon being sprayed the dog stopped barking. We also found the collars to be effective while we were away with no further reports of incessant barking according to our neighbors.Unfortunately, our excitement was short lived. Both collars stopped working after about a week of use! We've tried all suggestions in the troubleshooting guide and have had no success. And while Amazon has always been great about returns, we just learned that these collars CAN NOT BE RETURNED due to their flammable contents. If you read through all of the customer reviews, including those with one star, you will see numerous reports of the collars simply not working.I am deeply disappointed in the quality of these collars, the inability to return them and the continued availability of this sub-par product on the Amazon.com website.Buyer beware!

She still shows signs of her hips hurting but she is waaay better then she was before.

I ordered this for my rabbit and he loved it so much, I ordered a second one for him. I have the first one in his rabbit run and the high sides protect it a little from the wind. The new one will go in his hutch.It's big enough that he can hang out in it, or curl up and sleep, which he does quite often! He definitely prefers it over the other litterboxes we've tried. It doesn't attach to his cage, but he could care less and it's stable enough for him without that.While I would love the ability to choose the color I received, that's a minor quibble for me.

"I bought this a few years ago for my two cats to replace original version of Drinkwell. My cats prefer to drink straight from the stream, so I can tell they miss that part, but it is a lot easier for me to clean. B/c its design is based on curvature and has little tight corners, I can get it thoroughly cleaned. The filter blocks the debris very well. But, if you are lazy like me, and pour some water directly into the bowl, instead of refilling the water through the dorm like you are supposed to, you could increase the water level to above the filter, and all the cat hair and debris go over the filter and starts to clog the pump.It took me a few years to realize that you could pull apart the front part of the pump, and can clean inside as well. It is very tightly fitted and hard for me to pull it apart.The main complain is the pump (or adapter for the pump). It fails after a year and half. You can just purchase replacement pump for $15 online, but is a little annoying. I also don't like the fountain is bulky and takes lots of space.

"We've had our adopted dog for 6 years. She came from the shelter where she was scheduled to be euthanized because her original owners did not want her back. She had been abused and taught to kill critters and run wild in the neighborhood, terrorizing dogs and cats. We have been successful in teaching her to the contrary and she is a very loving yet protective dog. Knowing we were the ones who needed training, we've watched numerous videos, read books, etc. Because we live in a wilderness setting, we never had much need to teach her how to walk on a leash. When we tried, though, we found out we needed a solution very quickly!Reading all the positive reviews here convinced us to try this harness. From the moment we put it on her, she responded like magic. No pulling or yanking our arms out. We are truly amazed at how well this very inexpensive (but well made) product works. The directions on the package are easy to follow. Because she chews on toys, we are well warned about not leaving the harness on her unattended. During the first couple of times we put it on her, we gave her a treat. She now gets excited whenever she sees us grab the harness/leash (we bought the combination), knowing she is going for a walk with us - no treats necessary now.",dogs,3

I ordered this product when I moved and the new tap water had a pH around 8. Unfortunately I did the pH test before I checked the kh and gh...

"I was living with 2 cats and 1 litter box in a tiny Manhattan apartment. In desperation I asked the guy at my pet supply store (you know Sammy, who plays guitar on a stool outside the shop on warm evenings, on Christopher across from the Hangar?) what was absolutely the best litter. He pointed me straight to Ever Clean. Yes, it's expensive, and I don't know anything about the environmental impacts of clay litter. But here's how it works:It quickly absorbs all the liquid from solid waste, leaving bone-dry, aroma-free little pellets. It forms large, firm clumps of liquid waste, which scoop out easily without crumbling. Somehow the clumps always reside below the dry surface. There simply is no odor. Currently I'm in a larger home, still with 2 cats, with the box in an open area just a few feet from my TV chair. I am, I admit, not very good about cleaning the box. Yet there simply is no odor. It's amazing.In short, the only reason to buy litter this expensive is that it works much better than any other brand. And it does.",cats,2

I had one similar to this in the past and it split at the openings. My dog is a bulldozer and can do that but it happened much to easily on the last one. This one is thicker and sturdy and takes as long as it shoudl for my dog to get his food out. He hated me when I first gave it to him because he's a FAST eater.

They were a good deal, and if you buy colored treats, you'd probably give them 5 stars.",dogs,3
I discovered Lean Treats at my vets office. My dog loves them. The treat is small and soft. Perfect for giving him his allergy pill.,dogs,3

"I bought a ""Canine Cooler"" for my dog about 5 years ago, and unlike most people - had no problems with puncturing until 2 weeks ago. My dog LOVED her bed, so I searched for a new cool-bed and came across this one. I ordered from this seller and received promptly. This bed seems to be much more robust and of better quality than my old Canine Cooler. The outside material is stronger and it seems to be much cooler and remain that way even when my furry girl lays on it throughout the night. I also LOVED the extra air valve - in addition to the water-filling valve - this was a simple but ingenious addition that the canine cooler does not have. I found it extremely difficult to expel the air out of the same water valve of my dog's old bed - with the Cool Bed III - this is no problem at all. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used a broom handle to run it across the entire width of the bed to remove the air pockets -which was EXTREMELY helpful!! Another reviewer said the bed was too heavy - make sure to follow instructions and fill it where you will keep it. Overall, it didn't seem too heavy to pull along the carpet. I don't think it's meant to transport by carrying or the inner core may bunch up as another reviewer said. I didn't notice any problems in this way, when I followed all instructions to turn the bed over, etc. When I threw my dog's old bed away she looked concerned; the instant I put her new bed down I had to coax her off of it while I filled it. She has been in heaven ever since...it is larger and fits her entire length; it is much softer and cooler than her old bed. Hopefully, the Cool Bed III lasts for several years, but for the quality and half the price as the other beds, so far we are thoroughly happy!",dogs,3
I don't know about you but there is nothing like a warm poo in your hand first thing in the morning.I don't think I'd even be interested in having a dog anymore if there wasn't the thought of being able to scoop up the warm poo after intently watching him give waste to his kibble every morning. How would I know I was still alive if not for the warm embrace?This product is absolutely brilliant but what about the fecal freaks... Where is our product?,cats,2
"This product is so dry it can cut a Cat's mouth, cause bleeding and choking. The product I received from Petco was dry as a Bone. It could be compared to eating a Fish without debonning it first.

"I live in a small space with a big cat! In the winter (which is sometimes long and hard in Upstate New York), it isn't always convenient to take out the ""litter trash"" every time I clean the cat box (usually twice a day!) The Litter Locker keeps the ""poop"" and the smell contained and my diva type cat very happy! A good investment, albeit maybe a bit expensive for refills if you have multi cats and use it as frequently as I do. All in all, a good investment for me.",cats,2
It keeps the dog busy but is not really durable. My yorkie chewed it up in less than one hour. This way it comes out really expensive.,dogs,3
"I don't know what it is about these bees, but my girl loves them!! She has the squirrels but they were getting a bit ratty after 6yrs of play so I ordered the bees. She loves taking them out of the hive and carrying them around. I frequently find the bees in the couch or under the covers in bed. Great toy!",dogs,3

"I don't frequently review purchases but decided that this is certainly worth telling people about.We have a 7 month old toy poodle who developed the worst breath that I've smelled in my whole life! It was really horrible and we were at our wit's end.I found this product by searching Google and then read the reviews here on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Within a couple of days there was a remarkable difference and in a couple more days her breath was great. Now, don't get me wrong, she does NOT have minty fresh breath but now she has healthy, pleasant normal dog breath.Now, who could ask for more?",cats,2

(pink if its cold - red when warm. Strange) Always keep several on hand, as the ACD like to steal and hide. Good throwing, bouncing toy and easy to pick up by the feet and get less slobber on you.",dogs,3

"My girl sheltie isn't excited about the game of fetch, but my boy sheltie is. Despite the higher price of these Planet Dog tennis balls, let me tell you why I think they're worth it.They don't have that fabric covering that regular tennis balls do. It's a smooth rubber that's easy to rinse off and the neon yellow color stays neon yellow. Regular tennis balls, I end up throwing them away when they get yucky from being outdoors in our yard... These Orbee Tuff balls don't get yucky (or if they do, they come clean easily) so they last far, far longer, hence being worth the money. For what I spent on these Orbee Tuff balls nearly 2 years ago, I would've spent on regular tennis balls that would've ended up in the trash from dirt and slobber. My 3-pack of Orbee Tuff tennis balls are still going strong.And that neon yellow color, very easy to find in the yard!I'm sure my boy sheltie appreciates the whistling sound they make as it adds to the excitement of the chase.",dogs,3

"We had a Drinkwell fountain for more than two years and after the recent birth of our first child and a cross-country move, found that we had become overly lax about giving it a thorough cleaning. The primary reason for this is that cleaning is very difficult -- it's almost impossible to get in every little nook and cranny. Plus the plastic the Drinkwell is made out of seemed to get grungy very easily and almost absorb minerals thanks to the hard water in our new home.I was a little apprehensive about the Catit fountain after reading a few of the reviews, but thought we would give it a try. The first thing we noticed while assembling that we really liked is that water is filtered *before* it returns to the pump (on the Drinkwell, it's filtered after going through the pump, which leads to a gunkier pump). It's also very quiet, so you don't get that ""running water"" sound that (with Drinkwell) occasionally led us to search for an open tap before we realized it was the fountain.Some people have mentioned having difficulty seating the reservoir so water flows over the dome properly. We did experience this after cleaning the fountain, but quickly discovered that we just needed to move the pump a bit to one side to allow for a secure fit.With the large reservoir, we also enjoy being able to go approximately a week between refills with two thirsty cats, instead of refilling daily (we did not purchase the Drinkwell's optional reservoir). It is also very easy to see if the water level is getting low. One note",dogs,3
"Since I started buying the Volkman See Featherglow Soak and Simmer, my two Meyers parrots are like different birds. So content and happy and healthy looking.

This gets cat hair better than other tools I have used. The only thing is my cat will not stay still long enought to get the job done. We can do little bits at a time and it comes off very well. My daughter has one for a long haired cat and it just comes off in bundles from her cat. Excellent tool.,cats,2
I purchased this some time ago. At that time I purchased quite a few doggie items and this one stands out as one of the best! My dog is in love with him and licks his tail and then plays attack with it. He has yet to cause any damage to it. It started looking dirty recently and I washed and dried it without any ill effects.update:I purchased two more. When I opened one the quality did not seem the same and it was not long and my dog had torn it up. The first one he had 6 months. When this one got torn up polyester and the squeeker came out. This is such a hazard for a dog. I am so lucky my dog did not ingest it along with the squeeker!,dogs,3

"Could use a little more (or wider) Velcro. I originally ordered an XXL for my Pit mix, going by the size charts I found on the web. When it came it was TOO large, so I returned it and got an XL, which fit well. Of course, as usual, this was a painless process with Amazon. The only problem was, it started to slide around on my dog or became unattached a little during walks. I got some cheap do-it-yourself snaps at Walmart and put them on it, which solved the problem. Other than the skimpy Velcro, the quality is top-notch! I was really amazed at how good it was for the price!",dogs,3
"I had previously purchased a soft sided crate....which my 6 month old new-to-me rescue hated, found out how to use the zippers, when zippers locked, he chewed his way out. He actually is much happier in this crate (which he has not even tried to get out of). I think it is because he can see so well. He uses it at night and even though he can see us, he gets up much later than he did in the one where he couldn't see well. Product works very well.",dogs,3

"We bought the Wahl 9990-502 as part of a two piece kit that also includes the smaller Stylus trimmer. The two pieces packaged together cost less than both bought individually.This clipper is louder than I would like, but probably not much louder than my electric razor. It's a nice looking unit that is contoured to fit in the hand comfortably. A cordless unit is much nicer to use than a corded unit since the cord invariably gets tangled up with the dog.A six setting Acculock Regulator is a bit tricky to use. We prefer using the additional blade length covers that snap on and off easily. For trimming around the paw pads, it's best to use the trimmer with no attachments at all.Our dogs tolerated the trimmer well, much better than a clip with the scissors. With the electric trimmer there is no/less danger of cutting the skin. We trimmed both dogs on the paws, rear end, and belly on one set of batteries and still seem to have plenty of power left.For touch-ups in between groomings, this little clipper is good enough. In the end it may allow the user to extend the time between expensive groomings to save a little money.",dogs,3

"I purchased this toy from another retailer for my dog for Christmas. He is absolutely in love with it and carries it everywhere he goes. My dog is a small breed (havanese), and is not encumbered by the kiwi's size and shape as he is with most plush dog toys. The beak has proven to be excellent for carrying, and his mouth can fit around the body without a problem which makes squeaking the toy easy. For any small dog owner whose furry friend loves squeakers, I highly recommend this toy. I was a little worried he wouldn't like the feel of the ""curly"" fur, but he doesn't mind it and it doesn't get caught in his teeth. The curly part of the toy seems to be holding up very nicely and shows no signs of wear so far. My dog likes to chew on his plush toys, so the feet (toes in particular) are beginning to look a little ragged. After searching stores for the replacement I will inevitably need to purchase and having no success, I was very pleased to find the toy here at amazon and will be buying a couple more, just in case. I have never seen him in his 11 years take to a toy like this one, and I know he'd be heartbroken without it!Here's a rundown of key points:Cost",dogs,3
"Little absolutely loves this toy! It's such a simple design, I'm embarrassed to have not made it myself. It is well crafted, and can tolerate a hearty tug of war battle, while also being super light and fluid, turning my kitty into a little ballerina. We have fun :)",cats,2

"We have 2 dogs, one 65 lbs, the other 30 lbs. They are both squirrel hunters and blast out of the house at high speed when they see a squirrel. This year we bought new, larger dog doors from Dogmate to better accomodate our 65lb hound. In 8 months, 2 of the plastic flaps for the large Dogmate dog doors have been broken in half, pieces flying everywhere, as the dogs head out on the chase for squirrels. I would not recommend these doors for anyone who doesn't have a geriatric, or sedentary dog, the plastic just doesn't hold up to the stresses of doggy enthusiam. Now we will have to replace our house doors in order to get new dog doors installed. We will be replacing the Dogmate dog doors with ones from a different company that have rubber flaps. We will also look for metal frame dog doors this time, the plastic on these doors is really low quality.",dogs,3
"I HATE IT!!! It's actually worse than a regular litter box. I use the clumping litter that they recommend, and it clumps all right, and then sticks to the scrapping tines. Also, the scrapping tines are a good 1/2 inch above the bottom of the box, so there are always clumps and lumps left in the box. It cost a lot of money, and I'm throwing mine out with the garbage.",cats,2
"I bought this because I own an &#34;extreme chewer&#34;. It said it would last as did many of the reviews. Well, my yellow lab had it in 1/2 inch pieces within a few hours. I would not recommend this if you have a dog that is known to shred store bought toys within minutes. So far, the only &#34;toy&#34; my dog can't destroy is the heavy duty laundry detergent bottles.",dogs,3
"This litter has lower dust compared to other clay types, and it lasts 2-3 times longer than the other brands. Sure a little leaks out if you don't open the box correctly, but the main point we want out of our litter is for it to remove the odor and to last.I know it is a little more expensive, but if you are on the edge about buying this, just give one box a serious try and you will be super happy. I have tried at least 5 others brands trying to save money and finally gave into the Ever Clean Litter. I HATE the smell of cat litter, but much worse the poo.I HIGHLY recommend this litter.",cats,2
I have 4 large dogs and ants were getting into the dogfood bags. This vault is the best design I have seen. It can be twisted shut with 2 fingers.

"Buttons has had two BAD pancreatitis attacks. Since starting this product he has only had one mild attack. His BMs are the healthiest I have ever seen. This product is REALLY doing the job for him. Not only that, Dr.Goodpet's Digestive Enzymes were MUCH less expensive than the many others on the market.",dogs,3
"The problem with this product is that a smart and motivated cat (such as ours, apparently) can stick its paw up the delivery chute and wiggle the auger, causing a slow but endless trickle of kibble. We tried larger cat kibble, to no avail. If the auger was longer or a tighter fit in the passage, or there was less wiggle room in the mechanism, that might help. Once we noticed that the cat was feeding at all hours and not just when the feeder was scheduled to deliver kibble, I tried wiggling my finger inside the delivery chute and sure enough, a few bits of kibble were released with each wiggle, and this goes on indefinitely. This product might work for a cat that is less obsessed with food than ours, but it is annoying that at this price the mechanics can be by-passed by a cat's paw.",cats,2
"I want my 7 month old 15 pound puppy to be reasonably trained for safety and calmness, but I don't particularly care if she heels or not. I just want a good, relaxed walk. The Easy-Walk harness has been a Godsend. Now we can walk along at a nice, quick clip, but it is impossible for her to pull ahead on the leash or suddenly almost yank my arm off as she goes after a squirrel, which she was doing before. I also find that it now takes just a slight pull on the leash to correct her. She became used to the harness in minutes. (I use the harness with a flex leash, and it works fine for my needs.)",dogs,3
I needed a crate for our long haired chihuahua and this fit the bill perfectly. It big enough to allow our dog plenty of room to stretch out but small enough to take along with us when we travel. It folds almost flat when not in use. Great crate!,dogs,3
"Incredible, never thought it would work, I would recommmed it to anyone. Works better than the Dog Whisperer! It worked the first time I tried it. You can't just push the button, I first say NO, and if he doesn't respond I say NO and press the button. Now I just say NO and he will stop without pressing the button. Worth the $$$$.",dogs,3
"I buy a lot of things at Amazon, but rarely write reviews. I had to do this one because I'm still shocked after the Fedex guy rang my doorbell a few minutes ago.I ordered this product about ten days ago and my kitty absolutely loved it from the start. She absolutely went nuts jumping over it, rolling around in it, treating it like a trampoline. It held up well. It was open for a couple of days. The [problem started when we tried to fold it.It just would not fold the way it was demonstrated in the video (find it on the Wild Whiskers website or look for ""Feline Funhouse"" on Youtube).THe frame was bent in one section. It could have happened because I applied too much pressure while trying to fold it.On Day 3 I contacted them by phone and left a message. Catharine called me back within a few hours and requested me to send in pics demonstrating the problem. This was last Friday. Saturday morning I sent in the pics. Monday morning (yesterday), she sent me an e-mail saying a new one was on the way by Fedex. This morning it was at my door. The defective one is fine when it's open. It just won't fold properly. So it will be donated to the local cat shelter.Lessons learnt:1. When you try to fold it and make it into a taco shape, pull the end further from you DIAGONALLY DOWN towards the floor.2. DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE. If you try it and it does not fold, keep trying, but DO NOT press on the frame 'cos it will bend and then it may not fold.3.

I could not find the return policy anywhere. Not in Amazon. Not in Absolutely Pets. Not in DogStuff-4u. With this kind of charges, it was not worth to return it. If you want to order products from DogStuff-4u or Absolutely Pets, you better hope you do not need to return them. Will not place order with DogStuff-4u and Absolutely Pets again.",cats,2

"When we returned from being out of town, the top of the feeder was off, all the food gone, and two very angry cats were glaring at us accusingly. I suspect all the neighborhood cats had a party at our feeder. It's too easy to pry off the top. I am considering screwing in three flat L-shaped pieces of metal that could prevent an animal from prying off the top, while still allowing the device to turn and reveal the new food. But it's too bad Lentek doesn't make it more cat-proof already. I would only recommend this for old, weak indoor cats with no curiosity, and low appetite.",cats,2
"It has no padding under it. Just the side bolsters are padded. Regardless, dogs seem to love it as long as it is on plush carpet. Not for old dogs with creaky bones.UPDATE",dogs,3
"My four cats seem to enjoy playing with this toy. I have added different types of balls,other small toys and catnip.

"I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing.",cats,2
I purchased this gate thinking my really young kittens wouldn't get over it so easily to get them use to the new house though of course being kittens this simple gate won't stop from going over. So of course this gate didn't really serve the purpose I had in mind for it. Though with that being said I still think this gate is a great gate for animal owners as it really is a sturdy gate that isn't easily going to be toppled over with a nudge or light push. If you own a dog and cat this will give the cat easy access to all rooms in the house while making sure the dog doesn't go into other areas or as well as keeping young babies/small children from accessing parts of the house as well.The door latch is really easy to use and with plenty of &#34;walk-Thru&#34; room to go through the gate and close behind you with an easy snap. This is a really good gate to have and HIGHLY recommend it for those that have a need for a gate in their house.,dogs,3
"Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try ""Canidae"". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try.",cats,2
"I was so excited when I first got this toy and my dogs would be entertained for hours. However, once they found out the trick to get the treat out,they did so instantly and abandoned the kong completely. I rarely use it anymore as they are just too smart for it.",dogs,3
"I have three year old twins and this gate has done a fabulous job of keeping them contained in the family room for over a year. It is not the most heavy or sturdy item--at this price, how could it be, but it has been perfectly adequate for us!",dogs,3
"I got this for my pug-zu puppy because the one I originally bought her was too big, this one fit really good which is the only good thing about it. She did not even wear this for a week before I noticed it was completely frayed. When I did notice the fraying I took it off her only to realize that the couple of times that I had adjusted it (because she seemed to be gagging a bit) it was only loosening on one side of the collar, the other side remained tight, almost like it was a mistake in how it was sewn. Over all I loved it when I recieved it but if it's going to be ruined in the first week, why bother?",dogs,3
"I was so excited to have this collar, but had a hard time getting it on our dog...most definitely this was user error, but it is confusing! once I got it on, my dog ran outside, and within 15 minutes had figured out how to pull/chew the collar off. We never got a chance to see if the spray mechanism worked or not.",dogs,3
"I bought this spray bar to go with my Fluval 305 Canister Filter. I have a 65-gallon planted tank and even on the filter's lowest setting the current was too strong for my smaller fish. I put the spray bar on one side of the tank so the flow goes from left to right. The current is still very strong but is distributed more evenly throughout the tank. It is not terribly easy to install, comes with no instructions (my boyfriend figured it out pretty quick) and has a tendency to come off the output if you move it around too much, but it is indispensable for this tank setup. I really, really wish that Fluval had included this with the filter rather than having to buy it separately, but on Amazon the cost is not prohibitive. It will work with any of Fluval's canister filters as they all use the same diameter tubing and connectors.Overall, it's not my favorite spray bar. (When I had an Eheim filter it was included and fit perfectly, although the plastic became opaque over time.) This is a pale gray color that is translucent, comes with sufficient suction clips, and has two spray bars included. My tank is sized so that I used only one, but using two would be possible. I have a backup anyway if the cats decide to take a swim and break the first one.It's really your only option if you want a spray bar on a Fluval Filter. Shame on Fluval for not including it free of charge!",fish aquatic pets,4
"My dogs started on Canidae 3 years ago. All of them had a dramatic change in energy and coat. They have done wonderfully on the food since. There has been a lot of negative attention recently with the formula change but I have yet to have any trouble with my 4 on the new formula. They continue to eat it and do well. They had no stool problems, itchiness, vomiting that others have suggested. I am still quite pleased with Canidae and will continue to use it for all of my dogs.",cats,2
"Initially, I rated this product at two-stars because the product details didn't state that the Perma-Lid attachment was NOT included. It shows it in the pictures, but when it arrived the enclosed paperwork states that you have to purchase a ""combo pack"" to get the lid attachment. It would have been nice if this information was clearly stated. Upon posting this review, the Litter Works Customer Service followed up with clarification and correction of the problem by sending me the permanent lid attachment. These actions were greatly appreciated. I am looking forward to trying the system out now that the Perma-Lid arrived and I can put the whole system into use. If all works out well and my cats take to the changes in their litter box set-up, this four-star review could be upgraded with a fifth star.Regardless of how the system works out, I am very impressed with the company's customer service follow-up. 5-stars to Litter Works Customer Service. Thanks to Brian.",cats,2
"My dog is in love with this toy, so much so I have bought three. Unfortunately, she can't have them any more, she can destroy it in a matter of minutes now. All she has to do is see it and she goes nuts, but she rips the little feet off and then guts it. Great toy for a dog that isn't determined on making the kill :(",dogs,3

"I ordered what was stated as nail clippers for medium to large dogs in the description. What I received was nail clippers for small dogs. I have a Pit Bull so needless to say that her nails are fairly large. Lucky for me, the clippers cut right through her nails with out hurting her or breaking the nail and making it rough. The blades are sharp no doubt but using them on her larger nails, I am not sure how long they will last. So, I have rated 3 stars because the clippers did do the job, but I was sent the wrong product.",dogs,3

"This product works very well. It stopped my 'sled dog' shepherd from pulling against the lead the very first time it was used (She was pulling on the collar so hard that she was constantly choking, gagging, and even throwing up). The only problem I've had with the gentle leader (other than price) is getting the right size. My dog is a border line small-medium dog with an average muzzle size. The nose loop on the small tends to be too small while the collar on the medium is too big. Needs more overlap on the nose loop with the next size up. If you have a big muzzle dog you'll need to get one size bigger than indicated.",dogs,3
"My dog had this as a first toy and she absolutely loved it. She would take it everywhere with her. When it needed, I had to restuff it with the stuffing and perform ""surgery"" cuz I bought a new one, but she wouldn't take to it - she kept going for the old one. In 6 years I performed this ""stuffing surgery"" twice -- which in my opinion makes it pretty durable since it was chomped on daily. My dog unfortunately passed away young, and I still have her little hartz squeaker next to her collar to remind me of her. :"")",dogs,3

"I bought this to complement my above-tank 60-gallon filter on a 25-gallon tank, and put it in an area where the other filter had a tough time cleaning. Like the other reviewer said, it was easy to set up, worked almost silently, and did a decent job of cleaning. Unfortunately I quickly found out that I had to clean it every 1-2 days because it just didn't have the capacity to hold more than a tiny bit of waste - annoying, since the parts tend to stick and need a lot of force to separate; there's absolutely no way this could handle a 10-gallon tank alone, let alone the 30 gallons it advertises. After 4-5 weeks, one of which I didn't even use it, the filter started to make a horrible loud noise, scaring me AND the turtle. I turned it off, cleaned it out, tried again, and got about a minute out of it before the noise came back; despite a week of tinkering with it, I couldn't fix it. I'm sure the excessive amount of cleaning it required had to do with its early death.Also, it claims to have ""2 inputs"", but I only ever saw one, so I'm not sure where that comes from.I might try to replace it, in which case I'll update the review.",fish aquatic pets,4
I saw these hammocks in the large pet cages at a local pet store. Many cats were laying in them and seemed to enjoy them. I looked and found this one and thought it would work in my cage from ProSelect. It does fit and is very well made but my cats (size 8 and 14 pounds) are just too big for it. I cut the clips and elastic off and they lay on it in their bed.,bunny rabbit central,1
"My only criticism is that I would like it to be more securely attached. The only thing holding it in place is the seat belt across the back. I'm not sure how well it would hold in an accident, and I hope never to find out!My Cavachon loves it. He has plenty of room to stretch out his entire body, which he couldn't do in the Outward Bound seat I had purchased. I like the soft cushioning, too, as well as the draw for storing his leash, water bowls, etc. He likes to hang his head over the side to be closer to me as I drive and it often goes into the area between the back and side walls. But I don't THINK that is a problem.It is very large and more than fills the passenger seat in the front of my van, but leaves some room for my trash basket.Overall, I am very pleased with it. It is easy to install, and more importantly, easy to get him into and out of.",dogs,3
"Pros:1. Reflective strap.2. Always retracts to the stop tab (not the clip)3. Easy to lock and unlock the leash with one finger4. Feels and looks sturdy5. I like that it does not retract all the way to the clip. It makes it easier for me to clip it onto my dog's harness.Cons:1. A little heavy for the amount of leash it holds2. Leash is a little short. It would be just as easy for me to wrap a longer, regular leash around my hand and work it manually.3. Tension is a little too much for my 5LB chihuahua. He ends up pulling against it when walking.4. Wrist strap is nice, but I wish it had an adjustable feature on it. I've had it slip off my hand and scared the heck out of my dog. It was not a pretty sight when I was trying to catch him while he was trying to run away from the clattering of the plastic casing. I now twist it after I put it on my wrist to make it snug.Not sure I'd buy this again. It's nice, but maybe for a slightly larger dog.",dogs,3

There is many controversy about this, but I found a very good article written by a veterinarian that gave me more details about just what I would be doing to her. the website can be found at [...]Or google it.

The clumps do not form well and the urine goes straight to the bottom where it forms a sticky mud that is hard to scrape off. The clumps that do successfully form, I assume with small urine volumes, are crumbly and must be handled delicately to prevent separation.

"I have had a heck of a time with my 16 year old cat getting into the kitchen cupboards. She would find a nice quiet place and take a nap in there. The problem was that she was getting hair on the dishes and I would need to wash them before using them, not too sanitary and a hassel. First, I tried moving items in front of the cabinets to make it more dificult for her to get in them. She learned to move those items. I then installed the heavy duty magnetic clips on the cupboards. The guy at Home Depot was sure that would do the trick. It didn't. She learned how to open those. I tried the ""Tattle Tale"". That one didn't even slow her down. I then got the Scat Mat Long Strip. She learned how to avoid touching it, standing on one side and reaching over to open the cupboard door and get into the cupboards.I then purchased the Medium size Scat Mat. She can't reach over to open the cupboards without activating the mat. I think this has done the trick! I haven't caught her in the act to see how she reacts when she did try it out. But I have caught her running out of the kitchen area at a lope and suspect that the mat activated. She hasn't tried it for a few days but I do think I have finally found a fix for this sneaky cat.",dogs,3

So when I tried it I was pretty cautious, but I soon got the hang of it. I did find that my dog got it wrapped around his legs several times..don't know if that was my fault or not. In the beginning, the lock was hard to engage.I did like that my dog had more room to roam and was not pulling me as much because of this. By the way, I have a 9 month old Golden Retriever named Jack. In his opinion, no leash is a good leash.",dogs,3

Realize, of course, that while this box takes much of the unpleasantness out of litter box cleaning, it should be completely cleaned (as in removing the litter and taking it apart to wash) every couple of weeks or the problem of ""items"" sticking to the bottom will occur.

"Here is the bad news. I've been using this system for about a year and always buy the brand here on Amazon. With 2 cats, I have to change the tray every 5 days - no joke. Sometimes I can wait until day 6, but by day 7 the cats won't go near the liter box and the smell is really bad. It isn't even remotely possible for the tray to last 2 weeks.Basically there are two problems. The first one is that there isn't enough space in the tray to collect the waste, so by day 7, it's overflowing with 2 cats. Also, there isn't enough crystals in the refill packages and the crystals don't clump, so the pee just sets in the tray. On day 5 when I change the tray, the catridge is full of waste, but all the saturated pee crystals are still in the tray. The arm doesn't scoop them away because the crystals don't clump.On the plus side, I still like this system - but just a little bit. I like the fact that I don't have to scoop, but that's about the only plus side to Scoop Free. Considering the cost of changing the trays every 5 days at $17 tray, it's a very expensive solution for the ""small"" convenience of not having to scoop.Is it a bad system? No, not at all. It's worth trying if you have the money to spend. My biggest gripe is that the reviews and marketing on the brand which say the trays last 2 weeks (with 2 cats, or 1 month with 1 cat) are a stretch of the truth.",cats,2
"We have a hyper-active I-must-go-first pulling lab and the gentle leader has been the only thing that helped to be in some control over his energy. He absolutely hates the gentle leader, and I can now understand why. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop him from pulling which results in the straps getting tighter and tighter around his nose. Then, he starts rubbing his nose everywhere, including bushes, his people, ground, etc. Well, a couple of days ago, I discovered a very bad open sore on the side of his face, just where the strap goes over. It's been very hot this summer, and he's been panting non-stop, in which case the strap gets tighter around his face because the mouth is open all the time. Nylon is a very rough fabric and can cause burns from constant rubbing. Please note that we have been using the gentle leader for a couple of years now and we switch to a new one when the plastic parts get loser and make it impossible to adjust the straps. The gentle leader that caused the wound is relatively new, probably a month or so old. In conclusion, this is not a perfect solution, and you need to keep checking if your dog has any sores/wounds if he/she starts to really dislike it. And we learned our lesson - it's best to invest time into training our dog rather than into fancy leashes.",dogs,3

He was also amazed with how quickly her hair had grown back (you could hardly see the line from where she was shaved). I strongly believe her recovery wouldn't have been so successful without Dasuquin with MSM. I wish I put her on this product from day one, maybe I could have avoided a torn ACL altogether!",dogs,3
"I started purchasing these when I first got my dog before she became super picky, so I'm not sure if she continues to eat them because she actually likes them or out of habit... but either way, she eats them and will be as motivated as she can be if she knows they are in my pocket. (She's simply NOT food motivated - I could have big macs in my pockets and it wouldn't matter to her)They definitely smell...different than other treats. These (along with Zukes) are the only treats like this that I feed; everything else is pure meat in various fashions. I only use one or two of these while on walks mixed in with the other training treats to keep the variety going as they are bigger than the 1-cal training treats we also use.I can't speak for their ability to ""calm"" animals as I have never noticed one way or another, but I'm just happy she's not spitting them out on the sidewalk as we're going! (To those of you who have food motivated dogs, I'm jealous!!)They are made with good ingredients (besides the grains, which are pretty much necessary as a binder with this type of treat) including being preserved with tocopherals instead of BHT and the like.I'm not sure why they aren't available on Amazon (Or EBay...) as I just ran out today and haven't seem them at my local pet store lately.

"I drew the short straw when it came to the household chore of cleaning the cat box. Obviously, it's the big drawback to cat ownership. I finally broke down and started looking at self-cleaning cat boxes.Originally, we were looking at getting a Litter Robot, but after reading complaints about smell and other issues online, we went for the ScoopFree. It's cheaper to start with, the drawback is the ongoing cost from the refills. However, after some research, I uncovered ""forever"" inserts that you can buy online from a well-known auction website. Another suggection (besides many of the others listed if you read the reviews) is to line the disposable tray with Coroplast. I think we're eventually going to go the ""forever"" route, and just buy the crystal litter ourselves.In any case, the Scoop Free works like a dream. It's quiet, effective, and hassle-free. Both of our cats took to it immediately, and you'd never know there was a cat box in the house. Yay!",cats,2

I really like how you never change all the parts of the filter at once so that you don't lose all the beneficial bacteria. Also, the water spout is higher than my old one so the water falls farther and makes a more powerful waterfall. My fish like the current, and it helps aerate the water. The only issue I have is that it creates a bit of a vibration on the table where the tank sits. I can't figure it out. Its still quieter than my old one, but that vibration is a little annoying.",fish aquatic pets,4

"After reading the reviews, I decided to give these collars a try. I found the review by M. Raymer ""Crazy Cat Lady"" especially helpful. The clasp on the 4 collars I got seemed to be just the right strength. One cat has gotten out of the collar once (collar broke away just as it should), but hasn't done it since. I find the clasp opens best for humans if you apply a slight upward pressure with your thumb, not just trying to pull it apart.I agree that the collars loosen up too easily. Per M. Raymer's recommendation, I pulled out the pliers and squeezed the sliding metal connectors to tighten them up once they were adjusted to my cat. I think these connectors need some real work - they move too easily, are cumbersome compared to the rest of the collar, and the edges are too sharp.All in all the best alternative I've found, but it still needs work!",cats,2

I would say this is a MUST unless you have a small dog.The star knob that came with the trailer broke and wouldn't come off the side support bar (had a friend cut it off), called Solvit and spoke with a VERY NICE agent named Pat, he apologized and said he would send out a replacement roof support bar (the plastic piece from inside of it was stuck to the star knob, the knob wasn't threaded into the screw so it was stuck fast to the side bar) and star knob and it arrived the same week!Thanks Solvit and thank you Pat!",cats,2

"The FURminator has drastically cut down on the amount of shed hair around the house. I also haven't seen any hairballs lately, but it's too soon to tell if that's a real effect of the FURminator. I find I have to use it at about once a week in order to keep my cats from shedding. It works much better than the other deshedding tools I've tried. I've been using it for about a month now.",cats,2

"Two of my six rescues wear Lupine collars and Lupine really will quickly and cheerfully replace them if they get chewed. The webbing comes out of the wash with the design looking crisp and spanking-new, no fading or fraying, and the one I had to replace had the buckle chewed, not the webbing. Working my way through putting them on all the dogs. I just wish they sold harnesses with an O-ring at the chest and sturdy strap on the back and not the step-in kind, which are useless for control or training with methods that use a harness. Maybe one day.Plum Blossom looks great on a blue-fawn brindle and Woofstock was perfect for our white and black peacemaker pit bull.",dogs,3

"This toy was a gift for our husky for Christmas and she loved it and quickly chewed the stuffing out of both eggs in mama playpus to get at the squeakers. We took them away, and she continues to chew the mama playpus. This is basically shredded after 2 days, but she still likes to carry around the carcass. I knew when I bought it that it probably wouldn't last long, so I can't say I'm too disappointed.",dogs,3

"I bought this box for my two cats who have been tracking cat litter all over my kitchen floor. My first attempt to solve this problem was a litter mat, but my cats just jumped over it. This was my second attempt and it works wonderfully. The stairs keep the litter contained and the ""tunnel"" out prevents them from avoiding the stairs. I still have the litter mat outside the box, but it hasn't had to catch much yet. My only issue with this box is that it is difficult to close the two halves.",cats,2

Just as advertised, within 12 hours, problem solved.",dogs,3
"Our Boston Terrier has a sensitive stomach, and was suffering with gastric distress, with a lot of smelly gas. We tried many other dog foods that did not work for him. We were delighted when we found this product. It works wonderfully, and relieves his distress (and ours). I know he is grateful and appreciates being fed food that doesn't cause gastric distress. How do I know this...he doesn't even go near the poodles food. This product was removed from the pet stores where we used to purchase, so I was excited to find it through an Amazon reseller at an equivalent price. Having it shipped to my home is convenient and cost effective.",dogs,3
"I bought this ball for my 8 year old lab mix for enrichment purposes. He was thrilled when I stuffed it with a few biscuits to start. He rolled it every which way then decided it would be best to tug on it. It ripped almost in half.

This item works just like it says - gets to the undercoat on our dog - just brush lightly. We had just brushed her using the regular brush and were very surprised to see how well this furminator took additional undercoat off. We would definately recommend this product.,cats,2
"One must put front legs through sleeves, very difficult to do and uncomfortable for the dog. Over all bad design.",dogs,3
"Our dog had a similar ball to this one for about 5 years and it was his favorite toy ever and after 5 years of daily chewing never once left a hole or loose plastic pieces. When we went looking for a replacement, we found this item. This item looks almost identical to the one we had for 5 years, but this one is made of soft, easily-removed-by-dog plastic and only lasted about 3 weeks before we had to take it away from him because we were concerned that he would swallow the plastic that was easily coming off as he chewed it. We ordered another one and after only a few weeks, we will be tossing this one as well. Our dog is less than 20 pounds and is 13 years old and had no problem chewing this ball apart very quickly. This is not a safe toy for your dog. This item easily presents a choking hazard for dogs and I would NOT recommend purchasing it.",dogs,3
"*Note* You may see this review on more than one size of this product. That is because I used it on a bunch of my pets and they were different weights :)After experiencing a flea infestation and trying just about every product out there (I did NOT use a flea bomb), this product saved my sanity! Along with it's partner - Capstar - I can say I have no more fear of a flea infestation.Program is a pill your pet takes once a month for preventative measures. The Capstar is a pill you give your pet at the first sighting of a flea. It says it starts to work within 1/2 hour, mine worked even faster.I don't know that you can say any more - these products were awesome! I will never use another product as, in my opinion, this one will save you time and money in the long run. Your pet will agree!As a side note - I overheard my vet telling a client that the flea bombs are worthless and not to use them as they do not actually get into the cracks and crevices where fleas and their eggs hide.One other note is to remember to wash all your bedding and vacuum everywhere (especially your furniture and under beds and furniture with open bottoms) in your house if you have a flea infestation. Seeing a couple fleas on your animals may or may not warrant that. Also remember to empty your vacuum cleaner right away after vacuuming and dispose of the bag or contents in a bag, seal and put in a garbage can ASAP so the live fleas do not get back out and reinfest your home.",dogs,3

"I purchased a bottle for my white malipoo and while it makes her look clean initially, I think after 2 days she gets more dirty than with other shampoos, it's almost as if it make dirt cling more. In addition, she normally has very soft fur when I use the right shampoos, with this product her fur was not at all smooth and soft and was harder to brush. I would not recommend this product",cats,2
"In my opinion this is an excellent retractable leash. I prefer it over the bigger ones, that have handles.It is lightweight, and fits comfortably in my hand. It can also be looped around the wrist.My dog is about 80 lbs, and is not a ""puller"", so I have not severely tested its strength. It certainly is plenty strong enough for a dog with leash manners.My previous Zip Lead was a present from my dog walker, who also preferred it to others. It lasted several years, and many hundreds of miles of dog walking, until somehow I got a knot inside it, that messed it up. I am glad that I have finally replaced it!",dogs,3
My local pet store was out of this product and I needed it in a hurry. The seller shipped the order even sooner than promised.Great seller.,cats,2
"Our dogs are both crate trained. However, one of them did not like these crates at all and pawed his way out (through the wall). They are essentially the same construction as fold-able camp chairs so if a dog wants out they won't stop them. We're going to tape up the holes and try again but we are not hopeful. For $70 bucks I'd expected a little bit heavier consruction.",dogs,3

"My wife and I have 2 adopted cats from abusive homes. One of the cats is terrified of people and we were hoping to find something to bring him out of his shell. This toy has done just that, making him playful and active. In fact if I place the toy on the table after playtime he will hop up onto the table to get it, as he just can't get enough. We've had the toy for about a month now and it's held up well, but the feather end will eventually need to be replaced. They are available for purchase seperately though, which is nice. Overall a great toy.",cats,2
"I purchased this product for my two cats. It worked for about 2 days then it started moving without anything in the box just back and forth back and forth, so I had to unplug it for a couple days. Then I pluged it back in and it worked for another 2 days and started to do the same thing. My advise is don't get this product get a cat box that works manual or electronic.",cats,2
I was so excited about this I didn't even hesitate. (Or measure) I ran out bought took it home filled it up and sat and watched. My cats love boxes as they all do. It wasn't five mins and my small kitty was in digging a hole and doing his business he is 13lbs he filled the whole box. And then if was my adult male 20lbs and he squished himself in there and tried to find a spot but just could stay it was too much for him. And he has never returned. So great idea but will be going to Lowes and making my own today in a much larger form. Because I stil have a small dog that loves the litter box:-(,cats,2

"I recently purchased some of these Ratherbee catnip items --2 Nip Sticks and 2 small catnip pillows. I have purchased these items several times in the past and have been very satisfied. I received the items with no problem from Cat Conncection. However, when I gave the items to my tabby cat, he tore each of them within 5 minutes of playing with them. Needless to say the catnip went all over and even he was surprised and stopped playing with the toy. I think they must be using a weaker fabric, because this never happened in the past and I have had some of these Ratherbee catnip toys for more than 5 years. I was able to salvage the toys by putting the large catnip stix into a fabric eyeglass case and sewing up the open end. For the smaller one, I emptied the catnip and put it into a fake fur mouse that is made to be filled with catnip. I bought this item at Target for about $3.49. Both are working out fine and my cat is enjoying the Ratherbee items in a much sturdier form. The product's quality control has really gone down (even as they are still priced at a premium). The catnip itself is still very powerful which is why I gave 1 star. Probably you should just buy their catnip and use some tough material make a pouch for it.",cats,2
"Received this as a Mother's Day gift from my daughters for my ""baby"" a 10 pound Chihuahua. It is perfect and exceeds any expectations that I or even little Candy had.

"One of the best pieces of advice I received when I got my puppy was to expose her to Nylabone products. They are one of the few dog toys that, 6 years later, she doesn't destroy within 5 minutes.

Better for a small, maybe medium sized dog.",dogs,3

It is very thin and tears easily. Within eight hours of letting my rabbit run around on it, he had dug two very large holes (about 6"" across) in the fabric, and there were several small rips and deep scratches just from him running around.Mind you, my rabbit is not very large, nor is he particularly rambunctious. I made my own lining out of some plastic-covered material from Beverly's (the kind you make outdoor furniture with) and it has held up well for several weeks now. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product.",birds,0
"We've been buying this at a local pet supplies shop. It really does work very well, but you have to use a lot of it, and it isn't cheap. I would rate this much higher, if it wasn't so damned expensive. If you don't need it as often, and as much, as we do, I recommend that you try it.",dogs,3
"This tag was much larger than I expected, but only had a tiny little space to write important information.

it works well. the only issue is to get the initial prime takes a little work! I would definately shut off the supply valve while priming the pump and then open it to get the siphoning effect. Also keep in mind installing this pump will be like installing a new aquariuim thus removing all the necessary bacteria. You may want to purchase a product called quick start after installation.,fish aquatic pets,4

"I'd previously had a Dr. Noys medium-size teddy bear to play tug-o-war with my 30 lb knee-high sheltie, and after 6 months of tug-o-war, it looked like it had open-heart surgery. Held up quite well (looked perfect for the first 5 months), so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl, as she loves stuffed toys.I don't use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war, as it's a bit too small, she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy (didn't have that problem with the medium size teddy bear).So instead, my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever). When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy, she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it's the best thing ever. She'll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises, and she'll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying ""Since you're down here at my level, play with me!"". Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy, she'll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute, squeaking the toy every couple seconds, just for the joy of it. The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking. She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully. But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.**UPDATE** September 13th, 2008",dogs,3

I've also found sites in which other dogs have met their unfortunate end due to this poorly made product. If you care about your pet avoid this product like the plague.",dogs,3

"As with other reviews I see here, must agree I am disappointed with the recent change in pad quality from Four Paws. These were the best of all others I had tried, but no longer absorb half as much. I also find more odor in the house and need to change 3 times as often. I would rather pay a higher price for good quality than pay the same for lesser quality and the extra work involved in keeping the house looking and smelling decent. Even my tiny dog has trouble finding a spot that isn't totally saturated. Fortunately, the extra large size hasn't been diminished - yet.",dogs,3
"Being slightly dusty is completely overlooked when the product virtually removes the odor of male cat urine. I am a ""clean freak"", which means I want my house to smell completely cat free. I also show and breed Exotic Shorthair and Persian cats. With three whole males in the house, we tried this litter, desperate for the miracle stories we had heard to be true. I can tell you that this crystal litter is a MUST for breeders or anyone with un-altered males living in their home. There is truly NO SMELL WHATSOEVER. With three males using one extra large top entry box, we find that we change out the crystals about every three weeks. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!",cats,2

Though it is advertised as a small furry animal cage and other reviewers commented on it being a great cage for rodents, we did not find this to be the case. If you are buying for a rat(s) be sure to buy a cage that is described as being specifically for rats.",bunny rabbit central,1
"First, I am a fan of the Gentle Leader. A couple years ago a friend recommended it to me, and it worked! For those dogs that pull, jump, and have no problem dragging down their human walker, this is the leash for that dog. That being said, I highly recommend the Eco version of the Gentle Leader--the material is softer. My dog would paw every time we went walking trying to get the GL off his face--but he does not paw at the Gentle Leader Eco version (amazon sells eco version as well). There is also definitely very minimal muzzle mark vs the original GL. To me it is an improvement on the original GL.",dogs,3
"I'm a marathoner and have been using this leash for several years. Just bought another so I'll have a backup if the first one falls apart. This is the best leash I've ever used for running with my dog. It's great not to have to hold onto the leash in your hands. Just clip it around your waist and you are off to the trails. The reason I only gave it four stars is because my dog initially was a lunger. He would try to take off after varmints and he snapped one of the plastic connectors. I replaced it with a heavier metal ring using a sewing machine. The other thing I like about this is that it is secured around your waist (your core) so you are more stable if your dog does lunge after something. It's not easy for him to move you around like it would be if you were holding onto the leash in your hand. Great stuff. And get the lunge buster, too.",dogs,3

"I purchased this for a pair of painted turtles to be housed in a 10 gallon tank and I am overly pleased. I find it to be a lot more powerful than anticipated, and it's extremely quiet. We have the tank in the same room where we sleep and it doesn't bother me one bit. I am a very sensitive sleeper also. The slightest of disturbances will awake me from the deepest of sleep. Regardless of where you keep the water level, it's as tranquil as ever.This filter is so powerful that it usually sucks 1 inch chunks of cucumber right to it's grate. It does not harm any of our fish and it doesn't bother the turtles either. The refills are very affordable, and if you perform water changes regularly, this filter will do an exceptional job. I have no issues with the heavy duty suction cups, other than sometimes they suck to hard to the glass. I will usually have to give the cups a pinch to break the suction from the aquarium wall. Be careful, because if you pull the unit too hard the suction cups will pop right out of the holes in the back. They are easily placed right back into place, though.I have owned fish tanks for over ten years and I find the Tetra Repto Filter (10 gallon) to be one of the most impressive I have seen. This unit is submersible, so you will need to get used to the natural process of algae forming on the cord, as well as the casing of the unit. The filter blends into the background and visitors hardly ever comment on the appearance. Like any other filter, you want to rinse out the (black) bio filter each time you do a (carbon) filter change. As long as you're not planning to use this for a much larger tank, I think you will be impressed too.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I have used these clippers for 2 years & was very satisfied UNTIL they stopped cutting. Motor ran fine, blades moved and were sharp & lubricated but would not cut.

They are now in the trash. Don't waste your money or time, move on to a better product.",dogs,3

Perhaps another week of this product, who knows the Co. says 10 to 14 days, and were at about the 14 day mark. It seems worth the investment as he seems better but if you don't have a situation where he can be his old self you have to move on to other things anyway, so at the moment i rate it above average but not a 5 yet.",dogs,3

We have a rescued Collie mix about 12 yrs old and a 18 month old German Shepard. Once we researched what is in other dog foods we choose Life's Abundance. A few months later when they both got sick right after opening a new bag of food I called the company as an FYI. Even thou our vet was sure it was not the food. Dr. Jane called personally and we discussed our situation. In this day and age I was worried about contamination. She tested our own sample and called again to check on our dogs. She is a marvelous person that stands behind what she sells. The food was NOT at fault but how many other businesses out there would take the time to research and contact the consumer. I HIGHLY recommend this product.,dogs,3

I do not use it as a Cargo Liner, I just drape it across the back seat of my Ford Explorer so I can't speak about how it ""fits"" the cargo liner area.It has kept my seats clean and I usually only have to shake it off to clean it, but I have washed it several times and it's held up great from both the washer and dryer.

We are so happy we bought them and urge anyone considering one to go ahead and get one because they will not be disappointed. There is absolutely no smell from the litter boxes now. Probably one of the best kitty purchases we have made. There is some noise when it rakes but it is not annoying at all. Five stars are not enough.",cats,2
"I have to be honest here. I just got this water fountain yesterday, but my first impressions are very favorable. It was a breeze to put together. That maybe because I had another pet fountain, and although it was a completely different make and design, it was based on the same idea. The instructions however were quite simple to follow. I do feel I need to point out something that i discovered accidently. After I had put the unit together, as instructed, filled it with water and turned it on. I was initially disappointed because it was making a rather annoying gurgling noise. However, when I disassembled and reassembled the parts around the water pump I discovered that one of the top parts that fits onto the water pumps outlet nozzle just hadn't quite set right, but when it WAS in place correctly the noise disappeared, and I mean DISAPPEARED! This thing is asolutely dead ""turnded off"" silent when it's running. like I said at the beginning of this review, this unit is brand new to me, so only time and proper maintenance will determine it' true worth, but for now I think it's great.",cats,2

K So i bought this product becasue my brother recommended it to me . I got it put is together and got the clumping cat litter with some doubts cause it seemed so simple. And it really is ...roll it over pull out the thingy holding the poop and pee dump and roll it back - put extra cat litter if needed. it good and works well and is sturdy. I now have 5 cats so I migth get another one but this one is okay for them and they love it ....nice job,cats,2

"I purchased three of these to transport each of my three cats some 90 miles on a drive south to my parents' house. Along the way, each of them, one at a time, often while traveling at a high rate of speed on the freeway managed with little difficulty to escape from their carriers. My oldenst after escaping decided to show her appreciation by urinating on her sister who was curled up on the passenger front seat. Thank goodness for Nature's Miracle, but that's another review. The closure for these carriers is totally inadequate for cats. Perhaps a dog might find it more difficult to wiggle the zipper back and escape, but not any cat I currently own. After several zip-ties and rigging I returned home without incident, and threw these worthless carriers away!",cats,2

"I just have to chime in again with a wholehearted recommendation of this product. I have an eight month old golden who looks on any new toy as a personal challenge. She LOVES these squirrels, and can play with them for hours. She gets some serious tug going, her with the squirel in her mouth, me holding the tail, until I think my arms are going to give our. Not one of the squirrels has been damaged by this in the three months we've had this toy. Everything else she tends to destroy in minutes. She actually doesn't really like the trunk, it just frustrates her that it makes it harder to get to the squirrels.Either way, I say that any toy that a destructive ripping/chewing/tugging/shredding dog can play with every day for months is worth its weight in gold.Update 4/6/12Well, she did eventually destroy the squirrels, but they were seriously on borrowed time, so it was hardly an occasion to grieve. I bought her new squirrels as she loves them so much. She proceeded to tear through them in about a week. Oh well. Destroying toys is what she loves, and these are definitely favorites. They still last longer than most, and the replacement squirrels are a good value, since she was never interested in the tree.

"I bought this item in hopes it would make things easier for me. It worked great the first night. The second night I noticed a huge pile of litter outside the litterbox. The 'bowl' is not very high so any cat will kick out alot more litter than a normal litter box, especially if you are used to an enclosed one. My cat paws at litter more than normal so the excess outside was very large. I normally wouldnt have been worried but much of this litter was getting between the bowl and the base of the unit. The gears that turn the bowl are found here and I did not want the motor to burn out like others have. I had to use a bunch of cardboard taped together to make a large wall inside the bowl to keep the litter inside, and figure out how to connect it to the base so that the bowl could still turn. I also had to put more cardboard between the base and bowl to prevent the excess litter from getting under the bowl where the gears are. Once I got that set it worked great. The main problem",cats,2
"I, like many large dog owners, was hesitant to purchase a shock collar. I have a 90 lbs, 18 month old rottie, and she is very loveable. However, her idea of loving on people is running full speed at them and their dogs because it is play time. She also seems to think that the backyard landscaping is for her amusement. Well, that changed very quickly after a few warning beeps followed by low level shocks. Now I don't even have to shock her, I just beep her and she quickly goes to lay down. I would recommend this to anyone who has a large dog with any behavioral issue. Understand that this training device will work only if you catch them in the act and it is even more powerful tool when they dont see you. Be sure that you condition them with a warning beep prior to every shock and it will work with a beep in a few weeks.",dogs,3

"My dog has long hair and a lot of it. I tried the furminator and found that it does remove a lot of hair, but one has to be very careful when using it - just like the instructions mention. Because our dog has a lot of hair, it takes regular slow, controlled brushing ~ once per week to keep it under control. The brush is better used on the coat rather than the tail. I use a comb on his tail and hold on to the root section so that it doesn't cause pain. If only the furminator inventors could stop the static build up when brushing. That seems to really bother our dog.",cats,2

The aromatic hydrocarbons produced from softwood beddings can cause both respiratory and liver damage in rabbits and other small animals. What is it in the wood that's doing damage?

"We purchased this ball as well as the Snowball, and ""Fetch"" ball for our 11 year old pit bull for Christmas. This was a tough ball but did not last more than a week. She was able to pull the eight off of the ball and then rip the rest of it to shreds. However, the Snowball lasted over a month before she destroyed it. That is an 11 year record for our dog!

"I received this product at a Pet Expo as a giveaway. I used it on my two papillons one evening a few weeks ago when I couldn't find the Frontline I had purchased. By the next morning, both dogs were behaving erratically. One became reclusive, hiding under beds and chairs, moving with quick jerks when going from one place to another, scratching profusely. The other was extremely agitated, itching profusely, running in circles, darting and rolling around, crying, distracted, hiding in his crate. His skin became extremely red, appeared to be burned. His behavior was unrecognizable and he was MISERABLE. I called Sergeant's and spoke at least three times over the next few days to their specialists reporting the symptoms. They were well aware of these reactions and advised me to wash the dogs three times with dish soap. Then apply Vitamin E oil to the area where the product was applied. After three shampoos and use of the Vitamin E, it still took four or five days before the dogs returned to normal. This is clearly a VERY TOXIC product and should be avoided at all costs! It is appalling that this product is still on the market as it is well documented all over the place (now that I have searched) how poisonous it is for pets. Stick to FRONTLINE!",cats,2

"Long story short...The color from the test tube can not accurately be placed at any one point on the color chart that is provided. Using a computer to analyze the colors, the hue of my test tube is the same as the hue of the 20 mg/L color on the chart, but the saturation is the closest to the saturation of the 50 mg/L color on the chart, and the ""value"" is actually below the entire chart (it would correspond to 0.89 mg/L). I don't believe there is any way a human or computer can tell where, on the provided chart, the color of the test tube should fall. No matter how I tried to evaluate the colors (naked eye, computer-evaluated red/green/blue or hue/saturation/value), I was not able to come up with a value for my nitrate level. To me this kit was a complete waste of money, although I did have fun trying (unsuccessfully) to find a way to use their inadequate chart to figure out the nitrate level.Long story long...I test color vision every day and I have great color vision. I also got the opinion of other people and everyone agreed that the color of the test tube, before and after a 50% water change (to make sure I wasn't just off the chart), could not be placed anywhere in the provided chart. I read and re-read the instructions and followed it as best I could, although holding the last (of 3) bottles at a ""45 degree angle"" causes drops to fall out at a very fast rate and sometimes it is hard to allow only three drops into the test tube (this is not a plastic squeeze bottle, but a glass bottle that you must tilt ""at 45 degrees"" to allow the solution to drip out after shaking for 30 seconds). Personally, I think holding it at 30 or 20 degrees is much easier, but I'm not sure if that changes the size of the drops or not, so I just do what the directions say and throw everything out if more than 3 drops get into the test tube.Before I did a water change, the vivid violet color of the test tube was much different than any of the desaturated colors on the card, which ranged from light pink to dark purple/maroon. I did a 50% water change, thinking that maybe I was just off the chart, and the color of the test tube became more pale, but still did not match anything on the chart. I asked other people and they also had no idea where on the chart my test tube was. There is a limit on what the human eye can do in terms of color and I thought I would take human judgement out of the equation.I got the best lighting I could - difficult because this cylindrical test tube focuses light into a bright vertical beam behind it leaving dark areas near the edges and a much brighter color near the center of the tube when you hold it in front of the white area on the chart. Finally, I got it situated so the color was mostly uniform when looking through the test tube. I then took a digital photo of the test tube held against the white area on the color chart and analyzed it on my computer. There are many ways to represent colors. I used HSV (hue, saturation, value) because the colors on the chart appeared desaturated compared to my more vibrant test tube and I was hoping I could remove that from the equation (also RGB did not provide values that consistently increased or decreased going up or down the chart, where HSV did). I used OpenOffice spreadsheet to create regression equations to correlate each parameter (hue, saturation and value) with nitrate concentration based on the colors provided on the chart. The absolute values of the coefficients of determination were 0.987, 0.913 and 0.996. For those who don't know, if the coefficient of determination (R2) is close to 1, then your equation is very accurate and if it is close to 0 then it is not accurate at all. This means that, in the chart provided with this kit, the hue, saturation and value all change predictably when nitrate concentration changes and you can come up with mathematical formulas that you can plug the values from either H, S or V into and it will give you the nitrate concentration. So, if I record the hue reading from one of the colors on the chart and plug that into the hue formula, it will give me the nitrate concentration that is listed next to that color. This is also the case for saturation and ""value."" No matter which of the three I use, I always get very close to the numbers listed on the chart. For example, if I analyze the color that is supposed to indicate 20 mg/L on the chart, plugging the hue into the hue equation gives me 18.3 mg/L, saturation gives me 17 and value gives me 20.7 (all pretty close to the correct nitrate concentration of 20).Now, if the colors on this chart actually correlated with the possible colors in the test tube, you should also be able to take the hue, saturation or value from the color of the test tube and with the same formulas, come up with the nitrate concentration in the test tube. All three values should give you roughly the same nitrate concentration. So I analyzed the color from my test tube. Using the ""value"" of my test tube, my nitrates would be 0.89 mg/L. If I use the Hue, my nitrates are estimated at 21.2 mg/L (much higher) and if I use ""saturation,"" my nitrates are 45 mg/L (more than twice what I got from ""Hue"" and 50 times as high as what I got from ""value""). So, using the formulas I derived from the provided chart, the color of my test tube indicates that my nitrates are 1, 20 and 45 depending on what component of the color I use. These numbers are completely different from one another and show that the color of my test tube really wasn't anywhere in the spectrum of colors provided on the chart.No wonder I couldn't look at the color and see where it fit on the chart. The hue of my test tube was the same as the hue on the chart that indicates 20 mg/L, the saturation of my test tube was closest to the saturation on the chart that indicates 50 mg/L and the value of my test tube was actually off the chart low (lower than the value of the 5 mg/L color on the chart). I'm not sure if I just got a bad test kit or if this will be the same for all the kits, but I think I have shown that there is no way to use the color of the test tube and the colors on the provided chart to come up with a nitrate level. I recommend looking for another nitrate test kit.",fish aquatic pets,4

"If you own both dogs and cats, getting a water fountain is a must. Cats, as a rule, will not drink from the same water the dogs use and there are even dogs that can be territorial with their water. However, with a fountain everyone can drink from the nice clean stream that doesn't have anyone else's 'cooties' in it!

This Drinkwell fountain is great - it maintains a steady stream and, with the extra well in the back, it will hydrate five animals for a couple of days without a refill. One note of caution - make sure to purchase the cleaning brushes. This thing has all sorts of nooks and crannies that get downright slimy and need to be brush cleaned -- you just can't get to all the spots that need cleaning with your hand and a sponge ... the brush set they make for cleaning the Drinkwell does the job very well (and the brushes are useful for a lot of other jobs as well).",cats,2

The ropes are easily chewed threw by heavy chewers in a short period of time but the rope is made of cotton so there is no danger if the dog ingests small pieces of the rope. And the Kong Company sells replacement ropes with instructions for tying the special knots at each end for a nominal charge and they don't charge anything for shipping them. Don't be tempted to use replacement ropes made of anything but cotton, nylon or polypropylene for example from other sources, as this material will harm your dog if ingested.I would give this dog toy five stars if the ropes lasted longer but that is the only shortcoming in this terrific toy and I really don't see how the toy could have the appeal it does for my dog without the rope.",dogs,3
"Have tried everything to get our energetic girl to walk nice - Easy Walk does the trick! Problem is she still pulls, and the material edges are kind of sharp, which leads to abrasions at her under-arms which must be painful for her.

"My macaw loves to destroy these. They only last a day or two at most, and he doesn't care which one he gets as long as one shows up every so often. He'll sit there for a long time holding it conveniently and tearing chunk after chunk off. After all, the mark of a good parrot toy is that it is destructible and the more the mess the better. Our cockatiel loves them too, but they do last a bit longer for her. Highly recommend for other birds.",birds,0

"My mom's dog is a 10 year old German shepherd with severe osteo-arthritis. She lives in Brazil, and the equivalent supplement to Cosequin her dog was taking in there was just not making any effect....His back legs have become quite stiff, his energy level have declined, he complains in pain after taking showers, even with warm water, and was having difficulty getting around.The choices were either long term harsh anti-inflammatory or if he didn't show an improvement, euthanasia :(.Well..... We gave Cosequin a try, and lo and behold, it worked immediately. The very next day he was more alert, wanted to go for his walk, and was showing much less signs of pain. As recommended, we started with double of the dosage for two weeks, and then proceeded for the regular dose. Since his condition is so severe, we did not decrease the dosage to the recommended dosage - we kept him on the regular amount.Unfortunately mom ran out of it and he got worst..... I sent her another 250 capsule bottle but customs take forever in Brazil, so he suffered for a little while. Again, to prove that this supplement really works, he was doing really poorly, and immediately after he started taking again he started feeling great!He really likes the taste as well - mom opens the capsule and sprinkles it on a piece of boiled meat in the morning - it is his treat. She says it smells like milk, and he has no trouble eating it.This has greatly improved his quality of life - awesome product!",dogs,3
"The brush is very sturdy and very well made. It is a quality item. I guess I was just expecting miracles. I did notice it seemed to catch on knots I never even realized my short haired tabby had. His other plastic flat brush didn't seem to catch those before! It didn't seem to hurt him either - in fact as usual he was purring. I still see loose hair on him though! Is that what I should expect? I bought this brush because the plastic ""self cleaning"" one still left loose hair behind, but this one did too. I am brushing him both with the brush angled, and straight. Still there are loose hairs left on my cat. I guess it's just a thing with cats. The brush itself though is very well made! Also my vet uses either the same brush, or something very similar!",cats,2

"This dog toy is a must-have. Our pit bull only likes to play with stuffed toys, and sadly he manages to rip them up pretty fast. This one will not die! It has 3 squeakers, and it's so cute (yet annoying) when we're watching tv and the dog sits by the sofa chewing on the hedgehog. You can hear *eek* *eek* *eek* from the floor nearby.We replace it about every 3-4 months when the stuffing starts dribbling out and the fur gets all nasty. This toy (or one of it's incarnations) has been living at our house almost as long as the dog has.",dogs,3

"Seriously don't waste your time with other litter boxes. This is so easy to use that you don't mind cleaning your cat's litter every day.

I don't let her keep it to chew on so I don't know if she would destroy it up but we play fetch and tub-a-war and not a rip or puncture. This was a good price but I won't spend this much on a toy for her to distroy so she does not get to keep it unsupervised. It's her reward toy for positive reinforcement and training.",dogs,3

"I have 5 indoor house cats and I've used Bayer's Advantage for flea protection for years with no bad reactions or side effects to my cats. Like most people, in the last few years I've been trying to spend less money, so I decided to try this Sergeant's Silver Squeeze-on Flea Control for Cats over 5 pounds. In the past, I have had great results with other Sergeant's cat and dog products, such as the Sergeant's cat and dog wormers that you add to the animal's food. Due to my past success with Sergeant's products I decided to get this squeeze-on for routine flea protection on my indoor cats which, sometimes sneak outside when we open and close the door.All 5 of my cats are over 5 pounds and 2 of them are more than 20 pounds. I applied this squeeze on exactly as instructed at the base of the cat's neck, against the skin, in a small circular pattern. I noticed that this product is much thinner and much more watery and runny than Bayer's Advantage.Two of my 5 cats had an adverse reaction to this product. Including salivating profusely, walking around dizzy, they also seemed to be jumpy, easily aggravated and didn't want anyone to touch their faces, as well as, drinking more water than usual.Due to the runny consistency of this product, it seems to not really absorb as well as Advantage and must run down the cat's skin. So, the cat licks much more of this medication off themselves, which I believe causes the severe side effects in some cats. None of my cats have ever had a reaction like they had with this product.I immediately bathed the two cats that had the adverse reactions to this product and they were fine and acting normally in a few hours after I bathed them.The other 3 cats had no noticeable reactions to this product. If your cats don't have a reaction to this it seems to work fairly well.Due to the consistency and the adverse reactions my cats had, I won't be repurchasing this. I'm going back to my Advantage.",cats,2

I called the company and with receipt they will replace or refund, but if they refund what do you do with the big hole in your door if you cant find another door that fits that hole!!! Very disapointed with this product.",cats,2

"I also have used Advantage on my dog for a number of years and my dog has never seen a flea. I have 2 indoor cats that I do not use flea treatment on and neither of them have ever had a flea, so I'm guessing that if the dog picks up a flea outside, it is dead before or not long after it makes it to the house. My vet has stopped selling Advantage since it can be bought in a lot of stores now and they were going to Vectra 3D. I have had good luck with Advantage and didn't want to change if I didn't have to. I never thought about searching for Advantage on Amazon, but I am glad someone mentioned it to me. The cost online was half what my vet charges (the Vectra the vet sells is costly too)....so I could have been saving some money. My order came from Entirely Pets and I ordered it on Tuesday and received it in the mail on Thursday...now that is fast. It also was packaged well for a safe delivery. I still have a couple weeks before I can treat my dog with this purchase, but if the new product is inferior or of lesser quality to what I have been buying from the vet...I will edit my review.",dogs,3

"I'm struggling to get started telling you what a piece of nonsense this product really is. I bought it because my old Littermaid catbox had finally given up the ghost, after 3 1/2 years of worry free service. Yet, I could not find that model where I live. So, against my better judgment I bought this thing.If you have ever dreamed of having an automatic litter box that actually throws cat poop right out of the box and onto the floor -- or into your lap if you are sitting in front of it -- this is it. Buy two before they quit making them.The poop hurling feature springs into action when there is the slightest thing sticky on the bottom at the point in the cycle where the little wire cage is about to come up from the litter. The motor digs in, determined to finish the cycle, and when the wire basket finally breaks free it springs up and throws the poop like some kind of maniacal jack in the box.The clacking sound mentioned by other reviewers is also a common occurence, happening about ever third cycle, no matter how clean you keep the bottom of the litter bin. For optimal operation, you must sit there and watch the entire cycle, and when it starts to clack, gently push the wire poop basket arm with your finger, and it will complete the cycle. Of course, this also triggers the poop hurling feature. It throws the poop no matter how gently you press on the arm, no matter how clean the bottom of the litter bin.If you have more than one cat, you will have to empty the poop container every single day. It's quite small, and just two cats will fill it in a couple of days. You don't want to let it get that full, because that means some sticky stuff is bound to be on the bottom of the litter bin, triggering the poop hurling feature. Once a day is mandatory if you have two cats or more, and you should scrape the bottom with a wire brush tool at least twice a day.Also, the machine does not fire up automatically a few minutes after the cat leaves the machine. You have to fire it up yourself by pressing the button (the One Touch feature). In order to get this product to work right, at least part of the time, it's best to fire it up about 20-30 minutes after a cat uses it, every time a cat uses it.I don't know about you, but until now I have paid very little attention to my cats bathroom schedules, but now I can tell you about what time each one goes, and how many times a day, and it's amazing how regular they are, which I suppose means they are healthy cats. This knowledge is about the one thing I can thank this miserable machine for.This is really a NO STAR product, so God bless you if you buy it. I am going to buy two of the OLD Littermaid model out of next month's check and throw this one away. It would be showing contempt for humankind to even give it away to another cat owner for nothing. Please, save your money.",cats,2

The intake is broad enough that none of my fish get stuck as they swim by...lol. The plastic lid is a little flimsy, but if you take care of it, you won't break it.I also have to add that a few days or so after I got the tank set up, the light quite working...bad ballast. I was upset at the thought of all the hassle it would probably take to deal with getting it repaired/replaced by the manufacturer, but I was happily surprised that Marineland customer service was very nice, trusted me, didn't ask any questions, and just sent me a whole new component to replace the broken kit, and told me I could just keep the broken one...I got the replacement two days after I called.

"I recently bought this cage as a nice home for my syrian hamster. I purchased this cage over other ones because I read that hamster cages should have a wire top rather than a plastic top for better ventilation. Plus, it's a pretty good beginner cage because it comes with a house, 2 food trays that lock into the wires (to prevent spillage), 1 water bottle, 1 solid plastic wheel, and a 2nd story with a solid plastic ladder.It's a nice set, but I would only purchase this cage for a dwarf hamster since it is way too small for my syrian. You'd be surprised how much space gets used up by the house, wheel, and food trays. And if you buy a hamster potty and toys, your hamster will have a tough time finding a spot to stretch. But of all the cages I've seen out there, this one was the most reasonably priced for the quality of the cage.Remember",dogs,3
"We purchased the 36"" high 8 panel dog pen, and we love it. It is lightweight, and easily movable from space to space, which makes it a great way to keep our little puppy close to us, but still safe from eating cords or other household hazards. The lack of a walk-through door makes it harder to access the interior, but we were aware of that before we bought it. It has not tipped, but out little 5 pound puppy can easily push the sides if he wants, and he often ""rearranges"" it while playing. It serves its purpose, and we were aware of the shortcomings from reading other reviews. I would buy one again, because there is really nothing else out there to keep a small pet contained.",dogs,3
"As a vet tech of 22 yrs and a laboratory animal technologist of 7 yrs, and having a certificate in animal nutrition, I cannot stress the importance of the pelleted diet for birds. Most birds will pick out the high fat oil seeds that taste better and ignore or toss out the other seeds and dried fruits/veggies in seed based diets, when they do this they will give themselves ugly plummage and scaley feet, and beaks due to dietary imbalances. When an avian diet is pelleted, all the necessary elements of the ideal diet are ground together in such a way that each bite of food gives the animal complete nutrition. This diet is colorful and fruit flavored (looks like Trix cereal, kinda smells like it too..)my bird loves this diet. Funny, even when he (he is a sulfer crested cockatoo)decides he hates all the purple ones today, the red tomorrow and so on, no matter his mental issues, I dont worry about him going without proper balanced nutrition. His plummage and skin/beak are amazing. I have transitioned several seed diet eating birds for friends/coworkers/clients to this food (it comes in a variety of sizes for various sized hookbills) and have improved the color and quality of skin and feathers. I buy the giant bag on amazon as it is not avail in pet stores, even with the shipping, it is far more cost effective when purchased this way. If you choose to do this, when your bag arrives, divide the entire bag into multiple gallon size ziplock bags and date the bags. Store in freezer to retain freshness, vitamins and ideal nutrition.",birds,0

"My 20lb (at the time) terrier mix had to curl up VERY tightly to uncomfortably fit in it. He filled it up completely, but the website we ordered from (not amazon) charged a high restocking price so we gave it to my brother for his 15lb dog. She fits perfectly. She isn't able to stretch out and still has to curl up but for shorter car rides it works just fine. She definitely enjoys seeing everything go by from the window. Now at 25lbs, my own dog still likes to jump in it when he gets a chance. Having said that, the sides are not too sturdy if your dog leans on them and can tip the seat or fall out. It is also difficult to clean. Somehow, fur gets under the cover and since the seat is made of foam, it attracts fur and is hard to remove. The cover is also hard to get back on and after about one year of regular use (maybe once every two weeks), it has really worn down. It would be a good idea to use a blanket or some additional cover on top of the original cover. It is still a good car seat and the foam has held up pretty well. It really is overpriced, being that it is just a large piece of foam with a small drawer and cover on it; however, if the sides were sturdier and the seat were easier to clean I could give this 5 stars because the dogs do seem to enjoy it.",dogs,3
"We can't say enough good things about the Coolaroo bed! Our black lab has taken every bed that we ever bought her out the doggie door into the dog pen and proceeded to chew it up once she had shaken it to death. We were lucky if each bed we purchased lasted for 48 hours. We had been through several beds and wasted lots of money until we purchased the Coolaroo bed. She can't move this bed out the doggie door and chew it up -- it's great! Initially our dog was a little hesitant about climbing onto it but once she figured it out, we haven't been able to get her off it. She sleeps in our garage year 'round so it keeps her up off the floor. It cleans easily -- we just wash the cover with dog shampoo (we even use flea shampoo periodically), rinse it well and it air dries quickly in the sunshine. We bought a replacement cover this summer after our dog used the initial one for a year and the frame is still in excellent condition. We plan to be long time customers of the Coolaroo bed and recommend it to all of our friends!",cats,2

"This product is 5+ stars! My cat has now been on this food for over 2 years and has not had any UTI since I've started it. She used to be a frequent flyer at the vets office but thanks to wellness and their great products she's healthy as could be! When picking a product for her the vet wanted to put her on some expensive food which you could only get through them. So I ended up looking and doing some research and came across wellness food. The reviews from other sites also gave it 5 stars and I remember one person commenting on how her cats uti's have cleared up due to this product! So two years later, my cat is healthy and has the most wonderful coat on her! I know wellness products are a bit on the expensive side by I'm a firm believer in you get what you pay for! I won't switch to any other product! Im one happy wellness customer! And for a bit of info on cats with uti, my vet said that my cat wasn't drinking enough water. I got one of those water fountain things and she hated it. Solution to the problem?! I ended up starting to give my cat about two tablespoons of wellness wet cat food in the can just in the morning. I put just a little bit of water in it to make it to a pudding consistency and that just helps to make sure she gets enough fluids!",cats,2

The mounting parts are similar but different enough that the blade doesn't connect with the moving arm of the clipper--unless I hold the blade tight up against the clipper with my finger while cutting.It cuts so well, I'll keep it.I modified it with my grinder so it can sit closer to the clipper to make a better connection with the moving arm.

I am modifying this review, in fairness. What I see is that if consumers stand up for their beliefs, you CAN change things. But check out what you buy and what you are sent. I haven't looked for the new product yet...OLD REVIEW:No star.Very recently the formula was changed from Barley Malt Syrup to CORN SYRUP with Barley Malt extract. Now that humans have figured out that corn syrup is bad in processed foods, the industry, that is so heavily subsidized and produces something like 2600 calories of corn calorie per US person per day!, had to figure out where to put all of this corn syrup that they now have in abundance. So they probably made an attractive offer to Sentry.... Sorry, my cat isn't buying it...and it sounds like many other cats aren't either. AND I would never feed my cat corn syrup anyways.

I use this product in the laundry and as an air freshner. I am the care taker of my incontenent elderly mother and it helps to keep her room and the laundry smelling much better. It is not a miracle cure but it makes a huge difference with its fresh citrisy smell.,cats,2

I was told by my Veternarian to use Cosequin in regard to a mild bladder infection for my cat. He said that it aids in the health of the bladder by thickening the bladder lining. Along with aiding the bladder it is going to make any joint in her body feel better if there are any issues due to this product being Glucosamine Chondroitin. To date the bladder has no issues and she plays like she is a younger cat. I continue to keep her on it for joint health. It is a great product that will continue to be a daily supplement for the health of my cat. Thanks Nutramax for a super feline supplement product. m. brown,cats,2

"2nd day of using this collar and unfortunately, it doesn't seem to faze my 11lb miniature Dachshund, though it is fairly bulky for such a small dog. She adapted to the extra weight of the collar, and doesn't seemed bothered by it at all. I've put it on her for about an hour in the mornings and a couple of hours each night so far. As far as I know the device is working, though I can't smell anything or notice my dog reacting to it at all. For how much she is barking, I expected to smell even a hint of the citronella, but nope. Like I said, it does not distract her from her persistent barking (at &#34;perceived noises outside, doorbells on TV, anything that sounds like knocking on a door). I will likely return this item.",dogs,3

"This leader is incredible! My golden retriever was very difficult to walk. He had a problem with pulling. I put a choker on him thinking this would help, but didn't. He would pull so hard that the leash would leave marks on my hand. We went through training, which he mastered everything but walking on a leash. The instructor recommended this lead. I bought it, and walking him was night and day. I could walk him with just a light hold. He stays at my side and no longer pulls. I love to walk my dog now.",dogs,3

"I agree that this isn't terribly tricky and that cats can get the treats out relatively quickly, but they still love it and get very excited when they see me filling up their ""treat balls."" Because of the ease of getting the food out I usually fill these up with their regular kibble and let them use it to get some or all of their morning meal-definitely more fun and more active than the usual hovering over the bowl.Instead of giving each of my cats their own treat ball, I've started to put one treat ball out at a time-it makes it more challenging and fun for them to have to chase and battle for access to the treat ball (assuming your cats get along as well as ours do.) They make it like a game of soccer, and its very funny to see them trying to steal the ball from each other and to block the ball from being stolen while they chomp down the food that they have earned. One of my cats even has figured out how to ""guard"" the ball by sitting on it while he is busy eating the treat that fell out. Another has perfected the ""swat"".",cats,2
"I use the littermaid for in my home, however I have a screened enclosure and this works great outside instead of my cats having to make a run for it in the house if they have to go. I put it outside in the screened area (they are not allowed outside other than here) and they can use it without me worrying about them having an accident out there. When I first purchased it I had it in my hall and it was empty so they used it as a hide and seek space, I almost think they were disappointed it became a litterbox..lol.. I have to agree with other reviewers who stated the palm was not enough on top but easy enough to go to the dollar tree/dollar store or use coupons for Micaels or Joann's to get another palm or plant to put in it. I am happy with my purchase.",cats,2

This product does exactly what it's supposed to. My dogs seem to enjoy it and even some of my cats (5 of which were feral when we yanked them in from the dangerous street)let me use it on them.

Cosequin for cats is great! My cat is 9 years old(63 in cat years)and you'd never believe it. Cosequin keeps him active by supporting/protecting his joints and helping him move around. I recommend this to all cat owners.,cats,2
"I'm a walker and there's a small, annoying dog along my walking route that now and then runs up close to me and barks loudly. He has even brushed up against me at times. So, I bought this unit in hopes of having a non-violent defensive measure to keep him under control.So, I'm walking one day with my new dog repeller in my pocket and here comes Milo, all teeth and noise. I waited until he got to within 15-20 feet of me and then clicked the repeller's button, aiming it right at him, as directed. It was like I had turned off Milo's switch. He stopped dead in his tracks, ceased his nasty barking, and his expression went immediately to passive. Then he merely turned and ran back to his house. That one encounter alone was worth the price of the repeller.We also have two yappy miniature Dachshunds in our house and I have given them a short repeller burst now and then to keep them from doing their usual yapping duet. Now, all I have to do is show it to them and they slink away quietly. No need to press the button. This approach also works for keeping them from begging at the table.I give Pet Parade's Dog and Bark Repeller and Training Aid a 10 out of 10. For walkers, runners, and cyclists, this is a must-have item. Don't leave home without it!",dogs,3

"I purchased a San Francisco Bay Brand Shrimpery a few years ago, in order to hatch some baby brine shrimp to feed some fry that a few of my female guppies had had.As it turns out, purchasing the Shrimpery was a great idea, since those few guppy fry have grown into adulthood and now reside in two of my aquariums - males in one aquarium and females in the other, with the occasional joining of a few males and females in a neutral tank for the purpose of breeding.The guppies' sexes must be kept separated or your aquariums will become completely overpopulated over a brief period of time.The Shrimpery has not only worked very well for hatching baby brine shrimp for my guppy fry, but also for hatching BBS for some of my smaller adult fish, including fancy guppies and Rasbora Harlequins; the Rasboras absolutely devour the BBS when they are added to their tank.I keep several packets of San Francisco BBS eggs around so that I can have the hatchery going full time. This means that several times per week my Razzies and fancy guppies are treated to live BBS, and I always have BBS available in the event that any of my female guppies suddenly give birth to some fry.The BBS are higher in fat content than adult brine shrimp, however, they are mostly water and act as a natural diuretic for your fish. And since the BBS are only given as a treat a few times each week to my adult fish, instead of daily, they serve as part of an overall well balanced diet.As for the Shrimpery itself, it works best when drilling a small 1/2 inch diameter hole in the top cover, which you then place a plastic air hose into.The airline runs to an electric air pump which is used to aereate the Shrimpery, which results in much better hatches. I also use an airflow control valve which keeps the water from spilling out of the Shrimpery.I have not tried using baking soda as another reviewer of this product suggests - in order to increase the hatch rate - however, it makes sense that it would do so by adjusting the PH in the water in the Shrimpery.I also use tank water in the Shrimpery, and normally about a third of a teaspoon of BBS eggs at any given time. I have also found that when the water in the Shrimpery is warmer - 80 - 85 degrees - the BBS hatch rate is greater and faster.For those who are raising large numbers of fry, I would recommend going with either a homemade BBS hatching setup, or the one that San Francisco Bay sells, which includes a base for a plastic 32 ounce soda bottle to sit atop of (the bottom of the soda bottle is cut off and the cap removed - the screw top portion of the bottle is then screwed into the San Francisco Bay base, which is then connected to an airline which runs to an electric air pump).I have seen commercial breeders using several of these hatching setups for feeding large numbers of fry at a time, and they work very well.The aforementioned BBS hatch kit includes three packs of BBS eggs and a plastic base. What you will need in addition to this is a plastic soda bottle which you must then cut the bottom off of,and an electric air pump, and a few feet of 1/2"" airline tubing - both of which are readily available on Amazon.com.As for the Shrimpery itself, this is a great little BBS hatchery that takes up very little space, yet allows you to hatch BBS for feeding smaller fish (such as Rasbora Harlequins and fancy guppies) up to several times a week.And I almost forgot to mention that the Shrimpery also includes three packets of BBS eggs which will get you started.Highly recommended.",fish aquatic pets,4
"We have 2 great danes and they love their campers. They are big dogs, 145 lbs and 125 lbs and although they each have a camper they sometimes get in one together. We travel in a motor home and when they are not asleep on the sofa they love to be outside in their campers. I gave it a rating of 5 stars although we did have a problem with the frame bending and collapsing because the dogs are so big. My husband built a frame out of PVC pipe and installed it around the inside of the camper. This has solved the problem. The PVC frame is removable and can be disassembled when we pack up to travel. We leave the large door unzipped so they can go in and out as they please. I would not advise getting this item if your dog is a destructive chewer. It is made of heavy weight fabric but can definitely be shredded by a determined dog.",dogs,3

"My oldest dog is a 65 lb rot chow mix. Her back end is slowly failing and Im sure sore and she gets hot really easy at night. This leads to her being pretty squirrelly, pacing, panting, up and down all night. On the hardwood floor sit keeps us up a lot and my husband was starting to have a break down. I spent a number of hours online trying to reach a solution. Between this product(which I plug in at night and take out in morning lasted 2 months) and Composure dog cookies ( also amazing ) she is consistently sleeping through the night. I want to say this dog is 16 I've had her since she was 8 weeks. Over her life many of the quick fix, calm the dog things that are supposed to help with behavior or calming, like crating, rescue remedy, benadryl, etc have NEVER worked for her. She's a great dog, but very determined to do things her way. Not all products work for all dogs but the fact that these two products work for this dog make them miraculous in my book.",dogs,3

Have to say I bought the Orbee Soccer Ball for our 130# large pure Black Lab and he absolutely loved it until we got 25# Boston Beagel and she now has destroyed it totally. Cannot understand that but she is still chewing in that she is about 1 1/2yrs old and the black lab is now 5. I had the ball for 4yrs before the little one came into the picture. I still will buy more of this ball in fact I think I will get 2. Have to say though they are quite expensive but I am still going to get another in that it did really last a long time. Any of the other balls such as the tennis balls the little ones chews all the lining off so Orbee Soccer Ball you are my best bet for now. Hope all tries the Orbee ball and enjoys it!!,dogs,3

I can recommend it w/o hesitation.",dogs,3

I'd also only recommend this item for supervised play (not, as I'd hoped, as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy's crate overnight).

"We bought the gentle leader based on favorable reviews from others who have used it. The head collar works great, but it has a couple flaws.First, there is little to secure the neck collar from getting loosened or reset. The only thing to secure the sizing of the neck collar is the latch itself, which can easily loosen or reset when the collar is not being worn. We find ourselves refitting the collar every other time we put it on.When the collar is worn, the excess portion of the collar will dangle with no place to secure it. We knotted it a couple times to reduce the length, otherwise it would disturb the pup. Most quality collars will use two points to secure the collar and secure the excess, but not the gentle leader.Second, the nose loop wears down bald spots on our dog's snout, just under his eyes. This is supposedly remedied with a deluxe version using felt, but Amazon does not appear to carry it.",dogs,3

That's Ok though, I'll take what I can get!The toy's construction is not that great. One of the seams on the head started to split. It was fairly easy to sew back together, but be warned that it's not for aggressive chewers. Our dog is really gentle with her toys and does not try to rip them apart.

I wasn't sure how clean this would get my long fur dogs, but was pleasantly surprised as to how well it worked. It cleaned better than higher priced shampoos, smelled clean, and lasted a long time. A little of this shampoo goes a long way. This one bottle allowed for 7 shampoos and I have one Giant Breed, one Large Breed, and one Medium breed, all with very long, dense fur.I was also skeptical how long the dogs would remain clean but they stayed cleaner longer, than with any other shampoo I've ever used. I am sold on this shampoo. I've also used the hypoallergenic wipes and am pleased with them as well.",cats,2

"OK, so scrolling through the reviews here there are endless 1-star, ""the battery dies in a month reviews"". No kiddin! We saw it the first, second, third, fourth, etc... Time! I had a Petsafe collar with a red blinking light... I took out the Petsafe battery and figured out what needed to be done to replace it within a minute, so can you. When you remove the battery, the positive terminal (silver top of the battery with a ""+"" on it) will have a plastic ring around it that holds the battery in the holder. If you look carefully, you will see a couple of tabs and a seam that runs around the top lip. Just use a small screwdriver, or pocket knife to pry this ring off. It will break off...No matter - it was only glued on to begin with. Now get a pair of needle-nose pliers and grab gently along the side of the battery (where metal is exposed on the sides)... It may take a tiny bit of force to pull out, but it came right out for me. Now install a new Sanyo (or other brand) CR-1/3N battery (I picked one up at WalMart for $3.OO) by pressing it back in. You don't need to worry about gluing anything, it will hold just fine and will be that much easier to remove next month when it dies again. Now plug that joker back in and you're GTG. Petsafe makes a great product, but they should be ashamed of themselves for trying to sell this battery off as proprietary - BS!! Good Luck!",dogs,3

"My cockapoo is still getting used to it, but I love this car seat! We just completed a 500-plus car journey, and Levi didn't fuss once. In the Lookout II he can sit up and look around, but also curl up and be comfortable for long journeys. The drawer underneath is a welcome use of space; his leash, poop bags, food and treats are all in one place. That keeps my car neat, and everyone in the family knows where things are. I agonized over whether to get the M or L, and am so glad I went with the large! Levi is a 30-lb. cockapoo and he never would have fit into a medium. With that said, if you're dog is over 30-lbs., I doubt this seat would be big enough. My only concerns/criticisms are that the seat takes up more than half of the back seat (although I doubt it can be reconfigured to take up less space), and the strap that comes with the seat is far too short. Unless I was installing it wrong(?), I had to get creative with a narrow leash to attach to his harness instead.

"This stuff is amazing! It was a little bit expensive but the 8lb container said that it lasted a month. My kitty seems to fly through litter (I hate stinky litter) - so I picked this kind up. I can't say enough good things about it. The pee gets absorbed into the crystals - no smell and no need to scoop! The crystals change color - I think it will eventually show that it needs to be changed (it has been 2 weeks and it hasn't smelled yet).What I didn't expect was that there is practically no tracking. My kitty was horrible about it. I have a small apartment so his litter box is in the bathroom. I would have to tell people to wait to use the bathroom until I had a chance to sweep it all up. Not anymore!!! This stuff doesn't get stuck between his little toes so it doesn't get tracked around - in the 2 weeks we have had it there I have found only 5 or 6 tiny little crystals in his track mat and no where else.I will never buy any other kind of litter again! Previously I really liked the Tidy Cat Small Spaces, but now it doesn't even compare to this. I'm so glad that I took the chance!",cats,2

"I first saw the Furminator listed as a grooming feature in an ad by a local groomer. The ad had a link to the web site, where I learned more about the product. I found the best price at Amazon.com. The product works very well at removing the undercoat from my dog! He's a mixed breed with some Australian Shepard heritage, so he's got that furry layer under his top coat. First, I brush him out with my regular brush to get the knots out. Then I use the Furminator to work out the inner layers. It's amazing how much extra fur comes out! Apply gentle pressure with even strokes, being very careful of (or avoiding) sensitive areas. It's very easy to use. Reduces shedding very well. My dog's coat looks beautiful after grooming!",cats,2

"My dog has chewed through several nylon collars before and this is the first one that has managed to stay on for more than a month now. In the beginning, there is a pretty strong ""rubbery"" smell but that fades after a week or so. Also, my dog's neck is about 9 inches and the size small fits her on the second smallest slot. The collar has come loose a couple of times already, I think because the top slot became disengaged. However, the collar still stayed on, just the front part was hanging loose. The rubber material is somewhat stiff and because her neck is slim, the collar is doubled up and thick on the side. This is also why the ""Fydo"" sign hangs to the side and not in front, as shown in the picture. Overall though, I am very satisfied with the collar. The material is very sturdy and the design is quite attractive.",dogs,3

"I have leash trained many dogs at our local animal shelter, where I volunteer. I learned about the Gentle Leader head collar there, in a case of terrible cruelty, the owner had left the chain and clasp so tight around the dog's neck that it was overgrown by her neck; surgery was required to remove it! She was such a strong puller that none of our harnesses worked, while her neck healed. Using the Gentle Leader collar was like going from night to day, it does not fit the neck but rather at the back of the head. Immediately she walked beside me with minimal pulling. Upon adopting our new dog, we discovered that outside, she was a frantic puller, after each new smell. I ordered the Gentle Leader head collar and like magic, she walks by my side. It does not interfere with panting, drinking, and I assume, biting. A gentle pull on my part reminds her when she forgets. Also, at the shelter we had success using the large size on a big German Shepherd. Three endorsements. Great product. Just be careful YOU don't pull or jerk too hard.",dogs,3
"The ramp arrived today. Yes, it has weight (26lbs), but so does my dog ( 60 lbs),therefore, I needed something sturdy. It sets up easily and my dog took to it after a few attempts. My dog's hip strength is starting to diminish, so rather than strain my back lifting her in the car,not to mention getting covered in mud, this ramp is just the thing. I have a 4runner, so stowing it in the back is not a problem.I gave a 4 star rating because one end of the ramp arrived cracked due to shipping. Padding the ramp corners inside the box with strofoam or bubblewrap would help with the product arriving unbroken.",dogs,3
"Bought this to have a crate ""to go"" - comes with divider which we didn't need and carry handle that works well. Baxter has a larger crate for the house so he is already crate trained - he is a 13 lb. English Toy Spaniel - this crate worked well on our beach vacation and when folded fit in the trunk of a VW Beetle. The sign on it said it was a ""small"" - but I think it is more like a small medium.Well made and great price.",dogs,3
Good to add in rinse cycle if you're experiencing ringworms...just reassurance that your clothes are getting clean plus killing any fungus.,cats,2
"I had two cats previously who truly loved this product and would use it all the time, but my new cat doesn't seem to have much interest in it at all. He seems to prefer to rub his neck on anything BUT this product, can't quite figure that one out - LOL But I think most cats would use this product.",cats,2
"I love this product. We have two black labs and they shed like crazy so we HAVE to comb them on a regular basis to help prevent a lot of the excess shedding and this comb helps. I normally comb them outside because of the mass amounts of hair that comes off when we comb them. It is great at removing the excess hair in their undercoats. They're noticeably more shiny afterwards too. I would recommend this product to anyone. Also, I purchased this directly from Amazon, it arrived on time, the price was right, and at the time I didn't have to pay S&H. I noticed this comb sold for about $50 (for med. comb) in a popular pet catalog and that is before S&H was applied. Ordering it from Amazon is your best bet.",cats,2
"The Waggle Bone is the only toy that our 115 lb. Rottweiler hasn't destroyed. We have tried super jumbo Kongs, Nylabones, and anything else we could find that looked like it would stand up to an extreme chewer. This is her favorite toy, and the only one she'll actually play with. The rest she destroys in minutes. She also entertaines herself, tossing it in the air and chasing it. The rest of the time she will toss it into your lap for you to toss and she goes and gets it. Great durable toy that our Rottie really enjoys!",dogs,3
"My winter pups were housetrained in my screenroom. Despite using enzymatic cleansers during training, as soon as a humid day came, the smell of urine was apparent. I also have a pup who pees in the same shady spot of my yard and no matter what I've used the lingering smell of urine remains. I bought this product and used a trace amount mixed with water and saturated my screenroom several weeks back. While the humidity hasn't hit summer high, we've had a few days where all I've smelled was the powdery scent of the cleanser. I haven't used it outside yet but so far so good. As far as the cost, it is expensive but when I consider how much I spent on the enzymatic cleansers, vinegars, steam mops etc...I think it's more than cost effective. A smaller bottle may be more convenient for the average homeowner.",dogs,3
"Very good product. The cord is bite resistant and my dogs have not even tried to bite it or the bowl. It looks great, is sturdy, and does not get knocked over. I would buy again in a heartbeat. Plus it does as advertised and keeps the water warm and unfrozen.",dogs,3

"I have two Great Pyrenees and they started to produce pinkish saliva. It looked awful, but the vet said it was normal in white dogs. I tried several things that did not work or they wouldn't eat. They don't mind this at all on their food. Their saliva is now normal - no more pink!",dogs,3
"I bought this so I wouldn't have to put my maltese in the bathroom anymore. It's a great little pen that fits easily in my small kitchen. I've only put her in the pen a few times because she's usually pretty good around the house alone. But i put her food and water in there so she gets used to the idea of going in there and trusts the space. Even though I don't use it very much, i'm glad i bought it!",dogs,3
"We have three cats, and two of them are constantly playing with it. But all three use it to scratch and we haven't had a problem with them scratching the rug or the furniture since we got it. It's very enjoyable watching them play with it---each one plays differently. One likes to stop the ball, the other likes to keep it going. It was a great investment and very well worth the expense.",cats,2

The only rope toy that has lasted longer than a month with my gnawing crazy shiba-mix. Everything else he has unraveled within a day or less than a week. This thing is tightly wound & seems like they're individual rope rings because after unraveling one ring of rope it doesn't seem to be a catalyst for unraveling the rest of it. So its great. thats pretty much it. :) Now i just need to find a tug-toy that he can't destroy...,dogs,3
"I have a diabetic cat and this food is awesome. I also thought, how nice to have it delivered to my house for close to the same costs as I was paying in a very smelly pet store. BUT my main complaint not about amazon but that this is coming from another associated company...it did NOT arrive during the estimated time but 5 days later than that. In all total from order to delivery it took 17 days to receive my order!!! Had I know that I would have either ordered MUCH earlier or not at all! The final complaint is that this does not qualify for free shipping even thought the cost is over 25 dollars. Maybe again because it is an affliated company or due to the weight. This too made my wait and the costs to wait less appealing.",cats,2

"I bought the large version of this toy for my lab/shepard mix who is 65 pounds. My dog can go through toys pretty quickly so I tend to stick with brands that create the most durable toys to make my money last a little longer. The rope on this toy is made of nylon, not canvas like some of the other kong toys, and because it is made of nylon my dog ripped through the toy in less than 5 minutes. I literally opened the toy and by the time I turned around it was in two pieces. I gave it two stars because I was still able to use the fetch part of the toy without the rope.",dogs,3
"We purchased this for our Shiba Inu because we do not have a fenced yard and wanted him to have a way to run off some energy. Shibas are also notorious escape artists. The cable comes with a loop on one end, but you have to make your own loop on the other end. This makes sense as you may need to adjust the length in order to properly hang to line. There is hardware for making the loop, but no instructions. It may be obvious to people who are mechanically inclined, but apparently that isn't me. We installed the line and were testing it when the second loop came undone. We were standing right there, the dog was not unattended. The only instructions are precautions about not leaving the dog unattended (which is helpful since the line fails if you put it up wrong). There are no instructions about installation. There's no diagram. There's no phone number to call with questions. There's no way to know if you have all the parts. We still don't know what we did wrong. We will have to wait until we can ask one of our more mechanically inclined friends to help us before we can use the product. We won't use it again until then.",dogs,3

They claim it to have 7 settings. Well it only runs on one 24 clock.. So either you have your daylight lights on or you nighttime lights.. You plus daylight plug into yellow and actinic/nightime into blue plus.. You set the timer for whatever time you want the white lights to run.. then the other nightime lights come on for the remainder of the time until its time for the whites to turn on again.I bought this thinking i could program my daylights to come on at a certain time and then later in the day having my blue lights come on but nope.. doesnt work that way.. You can set it for different times of the week but thats it.. you cant have several times each day.. it was disappointing.. i finally got this answer from Coralife/Central who made this.i'm returning my unit as i do not want a timer that runs 24 hours a day. dont make the mistake of buying this and thinking you can program different times. It runs 24/7 on one clock only.,fish aquatic pets,4

"I have two outside cats that would be considered ferrel cats. One was injured either in a fight or hit by a car. He can get around pretty well and I have barns, but with the weather so bad, it was difficult for him to go back and forth. So, I put a mini house on a potting bench next to my back door and hooked up this heater. We have had one of the worst winters in my memory, but these cats kept comfortable on this heating pad and I didn't have to worry about getting out in the snow to take them food. The other cat is very wild and I suspect she had never felt a warm place in the winter before, but she settled in immediately the first time she felt it. I risked life and limb trapping them and having them fixed so I don't have to worry about more wild cats either. I have another cat that will come in the house and eat and visit, but absolutely refuses to stay in at night. I am thinking about getting another heating pad for her. She and the other female won't share.",cats,2

"This is a pretty tiny breeders box (check the dimensions), but it's pretty well made and detailed. There is a bottom slat where the fry can swim or fall to the bottom of the box and there's a divider so you can divide the box into two parts for two fish.The idea is that you put the pregnant fish on to the top compartment. They give birth to live young (the fry), who then fall to the bottom. The divider is in case you have two pregnant fish. There are slats on the sides for water flow, and there's even a lid so fish won't jump in or out. The whole box just sticks to the side of the tank inside by surface tension.Right now, I'm just using it to keep fry in and so far it works pretty well. It's small for any kind of fish, even small guppies, but for fry it's ok. I'm satisfied with it so far.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I got this prior to getting my 8 week old rottie. Set up was easy, and it's nice to see how large of an area it actually is. I'd be more comfortable with a large dog in this than a regular kennel. However, the black plastic anchors were off within 5 minutes of my new pup detecting them. He hates being in it so while he jumps around, it looses whatever shape I was going for and gets long and skinny. His bed and dishes will keep it from getting too narrow, and I'm sure it won't tip over since he's not a climber. It's OK, serving a purpose. I'd have rated it great if he hadn't gotten pieces off and fantastic if it did all it claims. If you have a bunny, duck or something similar it would be fantastic. A teething big dawg with a lot of attitude? A kennel may be better.",dogs,3
"Okay, First things first. I didn't actually use Petzlife. I did look at the ingredients list, did some research on the individual ingredients using pubmed.org, and then went to a health store and formulated my own. Of the ingredients that appear to be significant are neem oil, peppermint oil and ethanol (or just good ol' vodka). All three are strong antibacterials and can be consumed in small quantities safely. You might actually be able to get away with just spraying plain vodka on your dog's teeth. As crude as this sounds, ethanol is an excellent disinfectant. Before giving the formulation to them, I sprayed it in my mouth. I can attest it tastes terrible, and my dogs seemed to agree. Nevertheless, I had similar results. One month later, the dark green fossilized plaque fell off my twelve year old dog's back molars. She stopped pawing at her face (an indication of gum infection), her gums stopped bleeding when she chewed, and her hot trash of a breath disappeared.If I skip several days, her gums start to revert and her bad breath appears once again. Luckily, I can make this spray at a fraction of price in my own kitchen.",cats,2
"We bought this product for our black lab who has recently gone blind. We have stairs leading to our basement that we don't want him to fall down so we went to Petsmart and this product was $79.99! I checked on Amazon and it was only $46! I got this package and it was exactly what I wanted! It looks great in our house, was easy to assemble and is holding up really well! We haven't had a chance to use the ""thru gate"" for our cat but I'm assuming he'll love it! Great buy and I'd definitely recommend this to our fellow pet owners!",dogs,3

"I was really hoping that this would work. It seemed like a good idea. But even on high intensity, my 10 pound dog was able to push the mat out of the way. I'm not sure how he did this when the intensity was high, but when I got home, the matt was rolled up on one side and moved out of the pathway. He's very determined.I sent the mat back...but this may work for you dog so I would not disregard it without trying it first.",dogs,3
"When I received my new kitty box, the purple thing was broken. HOWEVER when I called Scoopfree, they promptly sent out a replacement. Even with the purple thing broken, it is still working as promised. There is NO SMELL... I repeat. NO SMELL. and its QUIET. I am pregnant and I can't clean the cat box, so this is the perfect alternative. It should be mentioned that not EVERY Scoopfree has the adjustable timer and counts how many times your cat used the box. Mine does not. However I really don't need all that jazz as long as it keeps performing the way it has been. The way I got the cat to use the box is by putting her in the room with the box for the day. She had food and water but it forced her to use it. Now she refuses to use the other box. This one is just so much cleaner. I can't say enough good things about it. I basically forget that it's there! The blue crystals do change colors though, so you definitely know the box has been used. but still now smell! When I poured the crystals in the box there was no dust storm either. I know this review is all over the place, but I'm a happy customer:)",cats,2

"This cage is great for pet rats as well. I house my two pet rats in this cage, and they seem to like it. The deal buying it with the igloo is a good thing to consider, my rats love their super pet igloo as well. If you have a rat or other small pet that is sensitive to dust and ammonia this is a great bet as it provides superb ventilation.Another good idea is to add some shelves or a hammock to provide more space and give them something to clamber on. If you do this you can house two or three rats in it. (Remember rats should be are social animals. Don't buy just one rat, please, please!)",small animals,5

Overall, it worked just fine and I am pleased with the purchase.",dogs,3
I bought this for our little dachshunds. It arrived today and I immediately took it outside and squeaked it before throwing it and our two dogs ran like crazy! Penny brought it back. On the third thow it did not squeak anymore. I had the same thing happen with another Air Dog Squeaker toy that arrived earlier in the week from a different supplier. One did not work at all upon arrival. I sent both back for a refund and will do the same for this item. I was under the impression that KONG toys were really durable. I'm not going to spend six dollars on a toy that doesn't last five minutes. The other purchase was 15.00 for the two dumbells. Very disappointed.,dogs,3

After I set it up, it started ""moaning"" and ""creaking"" something terrible, like it had swallowed some rocks and an elephant. I took it apart, and found that the impeller was really loose. I took out the impeller, scrubbed it gently, then placed it tightly back in the impeller housing. I primed it, plugged it back in, then waited. When it turned on after a second, it purred like a kitten. My bubbler is more noisy than this thing! To those who returned their filter",fish aquatic pets,4

"I live in an apartment with my lady, my working son, and 4 adult cats plus, one kitten. I have respiratory desease, and the amonnia was choking me, as well as the odors. I am unable to come near to clean, my son works long hot hours, my cat lover lady does to, so that leaves me to whatever. One day and I am happy withg the investment. Once all the pets get aclimatized, the small amount of litter or the negatives that I have seen posted are of insignificant matter compared to the advantages. Nothinbg is perfect, but, all around, this is the best product for the money, and I will be getting the deluxe model soon as finances are available. Now, I can do my thing with no more anxiety, or respiratory distress. If you buy, remember, give it time both the littermaid and the cats, there is adjustments. All cats are different. They have to adjust. If the complete cycle is allowed to happen, and you have the best clumping litter, Littermaid works fine.",cats,2

"I used this on my 12 week Great Dane puppy not thinking it would be harmful. She started sneezing a lot and had runny eyes. I thought she was allergic to the smell of it. Then she got extremely lethargic and wouldn't respond to anything, eat, drink or even move. I looked up the Hertz product and was astonished to read the amounts of death and poisoning from this product. I am absolutely sick that I used it on my dog. I called the vet who told me to immediately bathe her with Dawn dish soap and try to scrub it off her skin. She is still extremely ill and if not better by tomorrow I am supposed to take her in. I am heart broken I did this to my dog and devastated. If something happened to her I don't know what I would do. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! IT IS POISON!!!!!!!!!! The vet explained it is a non regulated pesticide that goes directly into the blood stream, which in turn poisons them. Frontline and Advantage vet approved flea and tick work through the sweat glands and is not harmful to them. PLEASE STOP buying any Hertz products. Read the blog Hertz kills!",dogs,3

It does not lather nearly as much as our previous shampoo and I cannot really tell a difference in the longevity of the &#8220;clean&#8221; scent as mentioned it other reviews (which I was really hoping for being a clean freak).

"The product helped the older larger dogs a LOT more than what was offered locally or at the vet, but didn't kill ALL the fleas. I was just grateful that they were no longer scratching 24/7. However, when we treated Mom's 9 pound, 9 month old Yorkie-poo he had a severe reaction and went into shock and we thought we were going to lose him. He lived thanks to the vets suggestions. I'd test with a drop and wait at least 4-5 hours to make sure yours can tolerate it because it can't be thoroughly removed from their systems. If a reaction occurs you need to bathe them immediately with lots of soap and water to dilute what's on the skin and hasn't been absorbed, encourage them to drink lots of water, and keep them walking and awake until they start to rebound from the effects. As far as our vet knew, there is nothing else that can be done to save a pet from a severe reaction to any of the drops that are out, so treat them like you would yourself with any chemical you put on your skin and just try a tiny bit first.",dogs,3
"My boyfriend suggested this box to me. He has two cats and said that it worked much more effectively than the litter maid. I have to agree. There is no odor at all with this box.

"This product will outlast any of the foam beds that you will purchase for your large dog. My wife and I have three labs, all over 65 pounds each. We have purchased several of the thick foam pad rectangular beds for our dogs. After time, the beds sag in the middle and loose their comfort level for the dogs. The beds were replaced once every 6-12 months at a cost of about $70.00 each in retail pet stores. We purchased one of the PetCare SSS OrthoCare Coil spring bed and it provides the support that our aging dogs require. This bed has not shown any signs of wear. It contains a cover and is water resistant. The cover is washable. Additionally, We have also noticed that this dog bed does not hold the odor that the other foam beds do. We also bought the sheets. Looking to purchase two more for the other two dogs. This bed will definately save us the money of constantly buying the foam beds. I don't often do this, but I am going to say it...""I love the bed AND I don't even sleep on it."" Your dog will definately need a pillow to support their head. We just used an old pillow that we were going to throw away.",dogs,3
"The Hikari Sinking Carnivore Pellet is a decent quality pellet for medium carnivores. I appreciate that the pellets don't quickly dissolve in water and it seems my fish really like munching on them. I use them to feed my 3 woodcats (which will eat just about anything) and my vampire pleco (which has been a fairly finicky eater) but all my fish enjoy them.No real downside to the Hikari Sinking pellets (maybe they could have a slightly higher protein content) overall they are a high quality food that my fish really respond to. The packaging leaves a little to be desired; I would prefer a solid container as opposed to the bag but that doesn't really influence the food quality, so it is just a minor inconvenience.",fish aquatic pets,4

"We have a 3 month old cockapoo who we love dearly. She's fantastic. We picked her up on Christmas eve and she' been great for our two kids and for my husband and I. She's had two problems since we've had her. She's had gas and she itches a lot. The lady in Pet Smart recommended plain yogurt and that worked for gas. She also recommended switching the dog food every time we buy a big bag. We're going to try something else and hopefully that will cure Joy's allergies. Otherwise, we'll be back on Merrick. Her stools are great. She loves it and she's healthy.",dogs,3

"I rescued Maggie (14 yrs old) from a home in which she was totally ignored. The litter might have ben scooped once every 10-14 days, so naturally Maggie peed wherever she could find a clean spot, usually the closet or the bathroom floor. When she came here I had 2 great guys, Eddie and Sammy, who were fastidious with the litter. Even clean litter (4 boxes for 3 cats) didn't matter to Maggie 'cause she was so used to filth and not using litter, but 2 closets instead. I tried so many different brands, to no avail. Then a friend with 6 cats raved about Cat Attract. And itworked (still have the closets blocked off, because I don't want her to regress, but this stuff is great and Eddie and Sammy adapted within 2 days.If you have a litter problem, give this a try.",cats,2

"My vet suggested one of these based on her assumption that my dog is anxious. It's had no effect so far, but my take is that the dog is ANYTHING but anxious. He's just easily excitable, especially in the car (which he loves to ride in) and barks like crazy at anything that moves - cyclists, runners, flags, birds, it doesn't matter. Traffic cones seem to set him off too. He has a huge smile the whole time; he's not anxious, he's having a blast. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I think this is a treatment for a problem my dog doesn't have.I'm also trying a DAP spray and a calming dog chew called Composure (both also available on Amazon) and they have had no noticeable effect either. Acepromazine works, but my vet frowns on anything more than very occasional use of it in special circumstances. Sigh.",dogs,3
"We just adpoted a seven month-old kitten. He absolutely loves this thing. He'll actually drag it onto the bed while we're sleeping. I guess he gets into the whole predator/prey thing with it.The construction is as solid as you could ask for for just a few bucks. It would take some effort to remove the streamer from the plastic handle. It would be difficult to chew off (but not impossible), and is strong enough to support an average cat's weight with some jerking and pulling.",cats,2
"I purchased this because I was going to be gone for three days and the instructions state that either dry or wet food can be kept fresh in it for up to a maximum of four days. I put the ice packs in the deep freeze prior to leaving and then put the appropriate amount of food in each tray, set the timer, and inserted the ice packs. I made sure I tested the units timer prior to leaving, however I didn't think to test the ice packs. It turns out this was a big mistake. When I got home, my cat had eaten from the first slot, however the remaining three slots still had all of the food in them and they smelled rancid. Luckily, I left out dry food in a separate container for my cat, as well. He ate all of it, so he didn't go hungry. The feeder turned fine and opened at the appropriate time, however I soon found out after testing the ice packs that they don't even stay frozen / cold for a 10 hour period! How can this company possibly say that it will keep food fresh for up to four days??? I promptly called the ""help line"" phone number and talked to a representative. What a joke! This person had no explanation and said I should deep freeze the canned cat food and put it in the feeder frozen. I told her that nothing in the instructions stated this had to be done for the food to stay fresh properly in the feeder, she said the ice packs should last up to 96 hours. I asked her if the company even tested this and she said she didn't have any idea. She told me to take it back to the place I purchased it if I was unhappy with it. She never offered a refund, an exchange, or anything. I will never buy another thing from this company. This item is a a piece of junk unless you use it for dry food only. Don't risk your pets health by putting canned food in it.",cats,2
"I bought this particular pet door because it was advertised as being good for energy efficiancy. It turns out to be just the opposite. With only a slight breeze, the door flap blows completely open.I spoke to the manufacturer's customer service. The first woman told me that I had installed the door backwards. She also asked me what metal the door was made of. Why would I know the material and the manufacturer wouldn't? After checking the installation manual, she was wrong. The door was installed as correctly as possible.

My turtles used to hide by this filter when I first got it, but they were never able to bask on it. I would suggest having a separate structure for them to bask on.

"We received our Buster Food Cube about 2 weeks ago. It is made of sturdy hard plastic with a hole in one side. The core can be removed to allow food to be easily loaded into the cube. The core is then replaced and clicks into place. I takes a bit of twisting to maneuver the food out from under the core, but it's never taken me more than a minute or 2 to get it into place.We have a 10 month old wheaten terrier who is smart but certainly no genius. We filled the cube with a combination of his normal dry food and a few delicious treats to entice him to keep using it. It took him a few hours to really get the hang of it - I had to show him a few times by batting it around but he quickly caught on to the fact that there is food inside. He uses it every day now like a pro. As some reviewers have mentioned this thing is INCREDIBLY loud if you have hard floors - he also bangs it into walls and doors on occasion which makes a real racket. I would recommend it for carpet only. Overall this is a great toy for keeping your dog occupied and make him work, especially when you're not home.",dogs,3

"My Cavalier ate through our last Flexi Leash, which was the corded one. I decided to try the all belt leash. He loves the freedom that it gives him, as do I. My only complaint was that after we left him with his grandparents while we went on a cruise, we returned to a partially chewed up leash. We are still able to use it, but I thought that the belt would be more resistant to dog chewing. I would definitely recommend this product, but if you have a dog that likes to chew- keep an extra eye on him :)",dogs,3

"We have two dogs. Both pullers.Dog # 1 is a 12 lb. two year old French Poodle named Ruffles. Despite his small size, he would pull and resist commands while walking and when other dogs were around, he would bark and get very emotional on leash.Enter the Gentle leader...I carefully viewed the instructional video and used some tasty bits of meat to entice Ruffles to be still and sit as I applied the device (which is very easy and quick) When I was comfortable that the fit was correct, I attached his leash and was amazed that he was not pulling me as we walked to the front door.He rubbed at the Leader a few times with his paws a few times but by the time we were a half block away from the house, he was walking without any head shaking or nose rubbing. We had a pleasant walk and came back home to relax (wearing the Leader) as we fit our brother Marley with his Gentle leader.As I write this review, Ruffles is snoozing away wearing his Leader and seems very comfortable and content wearing it (and with more than a few juicy bites of roast beef in his little tummy!)Now for Marley, our 35 lb., 8 month old Black lab-Australian Shepherd puppy. Marley is the ultimate puller! He can pull me so hard that I can hardly keep up with him, all the while practically choking himself on his standard leash and collar! He also had a habit of 'mouthing' alot. I dreaded walking him - until now. Here's why...Placing Marley's Gentle Leader was also simple as I used the meat treats and encouraged him to sit as my feet facing away from me as I slipped the loop over his nose, tightened it a little and quickly applied the neck snap. Adjusting for a good fit took a minute or two and consisted of a treat and an adjustment alternatively until I felt his Leader was properly placed.I will say Marley was a bit perplexed after it was in place and he shook his head and pawed at it, but once we started walking he was fine. He rubbed his nose into the grass and the Leader did not rotate or move from how I placed it. A couple more treats and words of praise worked wonders and once we were about 5 houses away from the front door, he was walking with only a few head shakes here and there. The miracle was he did not pull at all. As I guided him to cross the street, he was at my side and at no time did he step ahead of me. This was truly amazing. When we came back into the house after our walk, there was no 'mouthing' which is an added bonus.I love this product. I am now typing away and I have two dogs sleeping at my feet-both wearing their Gentle Leaders!The most important thing you can do is watch the instructional video, use treats and make sure the device fits properly - then have fun on the most memorable and amazing walk you have ever had with your special pup!",dogs,3
"I actually won this litter box in a drawing. I was planning on buying one any way. Glad I didn't, it started having problems after five weeks. Of course if I had purchased it, I would take it back and get a new one. But I'm having the same problems others have had, it has a hard time moving a clump of litter sometimes and starts clicking, it wastes litter and now it goes through 5 cycles EVERY time it sweeps even if there is only a small amount and it scoops it the first time.It's under warranty but the company wants $10 to ship new parts. I'm not paying 10 cents for their mistake (made in China by the way). When it quits completely, I'll go back to the good old plain litter box.",cats,2

"My Goffin cockatoo, Kelly Puffyfeathers, was able to destroy this in only a few days. They don't list the dimensions for this toy, just saying it is for medium and large birds. I was surprised to find that the dome portion is only about 3 inches tall. Kelly removed the ring at the top in 10 minutes and then when I tied it to his cage with one of the fabric dangles, proceeded to demolish the remainder in less than a week. I will say he had a lot of fun doing so but as far as price to length of playing time ratio, this failed in my opinion. I believe it would be fun for a smaller bird. However, since my 1 pound Goffin was able to do it in quickly, it would need to be a small parrot.",birds,0

Even if I hide treats all inside with the squirrels stuffed in the log, he prefers to ignore the squirrels and extract the treats while leaving them in there. He's also not one to go crazy for squeaky toys so that isn't interesting to him.Once the squirrels are finally are out, however, he LOVES the log! Ignoring the squirrels mostly, except to chew a bit on their tails, he loves to bring us the log for throwing. I think it's because he can carry it by one of the holes and it swings around for a delightfully 'dead animal' feel (yuck! Anyway - I give it 4 stars because he'll play fetch with the squirrels a few times and play fetch and tug with the log LOADS of times. All in all, happy pup.",dogs,3
"We raised seven orphaned cats. Now of varying age and some more fussy than others but all have transitioned to their new litter just fine. I reccommend that you vary the amount of the new litter (from 25% corn to 75% clay to 75% corn to 25% clay) in your litter boxes to allow each cat to adjust in their own time until all your litter boxes are 100% corn. The litter doesn't leave the box like clay litter and the cats seem to spend less time tidying up since the litter is lighter weight. There is absolutely no smell. I swear! No matter what others have written, in my home, even after an entire day away at work, I don't have that telltale scent when I enter my home. If you have multiiple cats, I am sure you know what I mean. Lastly the cost is definitely a factor. This litter uses less to clump and seems to last a lot longer than other litters. Saves a bunch! I just love it! I can only suggest you try it! You will be pleasantly surprised!",cats,2
"Bought this for our large yellow lab, 95 lbs. There conflicting information sources on sizing so I'll share that purchasing the XXL for my 95lb lab that measure 28-29 inches, neck to tail was definitely the right choice. The XL would be 4 inches shorter and shorter on the sides as well, not providing the warmth and coverage needed, which is why one purchases a warm coat for a dog in winter, right? That is what you're looking for here.Waited write this until it was washed and dried to see how it held up. States to wash cold water tumble cool. Our dryer does not have a cool air setting so we put it in for 20 minutes knowing that it would be warm with the last part having a cool down air and crossed our fingers and held our breath. No need as it went back in for a few more minutes, still a bit damp on the heavier parts and did not shrink, loose its shape, stitches....basically looks brand new coming out of the wash.We are very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it. Its difficult to find a sharp looking coat that is warm, not ridiculously priced or stupid looking. This is great all the way around. Living in the upper midwest its freezing cold with wind chills well below zero in winter. Our lab will not wear 'booties' but loves wearing a coat and this is easy and pie to put on.The only thing I would change is to put thicker velcro strips on but these are fine and do the trick. You must put them together prior to washing and drying or plan to spend time picking crap out of the velcro. LOLYou wear extra clothing in the freezing temps, put a coat on your pup! Don't dress him/her stupid, don't spend a fortune, don't buy something you have to fight with to dress them into.......Highly recommended. ; ) Happy shopper.",dogs,3

No animal or human was harmed during this experiment. Despite other reviewer complaints regarding the inconsistent motion trigger, I was hopeful when I placed my order. Unfortunately, I must add my review to the pile of the unsatisfied.An even greater disappointment is amazon's current denial of my return for this product, despite the manufacture's return policy included in the box that states I can get a refund.

"I have dogs who leave lots of hair behind. The back seat of my truck was covered with it even when I used a mover's blanket on the back seat. For my birthday, my daughter gave me a Solvit pet seat ccover for the truck. It is fabulous! I volunteer as a dog transporter for a rescue group and one of the dogs I was transporting didn't have very good bladder control so wet the seat cover. Even though I didn't have the water-proof one, very little urine actually made it through to the seat. After the transport, I just threw the seat cover in the washing machine and it cleaned up fine. I've also had dogs get sick to their stomachs on the seat cover and that is easy to clean, too!I just recently bought a little Honda Fit (which gets much better mileage than my truck) and I didn't let my dogs ride in the new car until I ordered and received another Solvit seat cover. It's been a good way to keep the dog hair off the seats of the new car.The only negative thing I've found is that the slits for the seat belts aren't quite wide enough for my Nissan Titan's back seat. If I need to use one of them, I can adjust the seat cover and use one or the other of the seat belts but not both. A friend of mine has a Dodge Ram and they fit her back seat's seat belts fine. Other than that, I have absolutely no complaints. I love the seat covers!",dogs,3
"I can't believe more people haven't complained about the fact that this door has no tunnel! It means that if installed in a hollow-core door, you can see the guts of the door. We were going to use this for the kitty powder room but didn't because we didn't want cat liter or poop ending up inside the door! They offered some peel-and-stick black foam to cover up the gap. Now THAT'S CLASSY! What a disappointment!",cats,2
"I have no idea what this one owner is complaining about or whining about how ineffective or particularly ""inhumane"" this collar is. It was professionally designed and if implemented correctly is one of the most HUMANE means of correcting and/or handling a canine. I first discovered these collars at my veterinarian's office as an alternative to a standard collar and certainly to choke collars, that I do feel are or can be inhumane, if not cruel and damaging.If the instructions for this collar are carefully read, which I suspect were not, the dog will adapt to this ""halter-type"" design. I have told many friends and acquaintances about this collar and have never had anyone make the comments found in the previous ""review"".I like to tell others that this is kind of like ""power steering"" for dogs. It is totally humane to any dog as you only have to use the smallest amount of pressure/pull on the leash. This acts just like a halter for a horse. No animal seems to like to have their heads moved to the side as a halter performs.I had purchased an Australian Shepard (Shasha) of my son's first dog, but he actually became leery of Shasha due to her unwieldy behaviour. Until I found the Gentle Leader Head Collar my son would almost cry if I suggested he take her leash when we went for walks. One of the additional benefits of this collar is the long soft tether-like lead/leash they provide for training especially indoors. Many of us have played that ""cat and mouse"" game with our pets as they just move or run just in time for us to miss catching them. With this tether device all you have to do is just step on it and now you have control.I even left this on this particular Aussie day in and day out allowing her to drink water from her bowl and eat her food with out any problem what so ever. We eventually were able to go to a more conventional collar (not a choke collar mind you either!) as she quickly learned and had successfully completed her obedience classes as well. Matter of fact, several of those in the class purchased one of these collars after seeing how well it worked.I kept this collar and used it to train one of my current canine buddies, Tasha, a black Labrador Retriever. Again, Tasha was a very highy energy dog that this collar performed perfectly and she is now on a standard collar.",dogs,3
This product has helped my dogs tremendously with their arthritis. I have 2 pitbull mixes and they both had a torn ACL and have had problems with their legs ever since the surgery. I have been giving them these pills once a day and it really made a big change with them. They are able to put their legs down again and hopefully over some time they will get more strength in their legs again. I would definetly recommend this product. It worked wonders for my dogs.,dogs,3

"I got this and several other Kong dog toys for my little mini dachshund puppy. She enjoys playing with them, although she's about to outgrow them. What's hysterical is that my mid-size Dobie mix loves these more than the dachshund, even though her mouth envelopes the toys nearly entirely. BTW, the second squeaker that comes with the toy is very handy. I recommend any of the Kong toys, unless your dog is a power chewer.",dogs,3
I bought this product to replace the Furminator as my dog (Black Lab) couldn't stand the sharp bristles on the Furminator.

Seems solidly built and I intend on using this on my girlfriends German Shepard tonight.,dogs,3

Highly recommended if you have a problem with fleas (we live in the south and the fleas never seem to go away!).",dogs,3
"One of my cats, Pooka, has always had issues with her water bowl. She spent too much time playing in the water, dragging her very heavy water dish around the kitchen and dumping it over just to watch the water run across the floor -- and ""drowning"" her little toy plush bunnies on a daily basis for nearly four years. I could handle the playing in the water and the drowning of her toys -- but having her dump the dish every day was really getting on my nerves. I researched why some cats love to play in their water bowls and would prefer drinking water from the tap. I had heard about pet drinking fountains but never thought that water movement was what Pooka was desperately seeking. That seemed to be the problem... no water movement.The Cat-It Large Fresh & Clear Drinking Fountain was perfect! She can drink from the water spilling over the dome -- or use the bowl at the bottom. Tommy is the other cat in the family and he's not particular at all about where he gets his drinking water. He loves the Cat-It fountain -- or a mud puddle. Both cats were immediately drawn to the Cat-It fountain. I had read reviews that mentioned not adding the additional food bowl to the fountain just to keep the cat chow out of the water. That made a lot of sense to me so I left it off. I did purchase the rather large plastic mat so there would be one more layer that might possibly keep Pooka from moving the fountain. It helps. She's still obsessed with moving the whole unit from side to side within the confines of the mat. I remind her that the fountain is for drinking -- not playing. She ignores me and continues doing whatever she's doing. The Cat-It Large Fresh & Clear Drinking Fountain has done the trick. I haven't had to mop up any spilled rivulets for a month!P.S. Recently, I came across an unsent email that Pooka was planning on sending to the Hagan Company suggesting the addition of colorfully flashing disco lights under the water dome...",dogs,3
"We have had the remote trainer for 5 weeks and we are still working with our dog every day with the trainer. We like the product and it is helping to control our 32 lb. puppy who is very hard headed and acts wild. He is part herding dog and there are 3 much smaller dogs in the house that he tries to herd. He does respond after a few beeps and stops being so wild. Alone, he is a really good dog. He is gentle too. We would purchase the product again.",dogs,3
"I've tried lots of treats and these temptations are the first to be a hit in every flavor. I keep them in an airtight glass jar, and as soon as I shake it the noise makes her come running from whereever to get a treat.I also use them as a reward whenever she scratches on the scratching post instead of the couch, she loves them so much she scratches all the time and then looks at me for a treat.",cats,2
This was an awsome purchase. I bought 2 of them and they were both way bigger than expected and fit what I needed perfectly. I was not supposed to get my puppy for a week after I oredered it but then I received a call that I could pick up my puupy early. Thankfully this was shipped very quickly and arrived right on my front porch and took less that 5 minutes to set up. Its very sturdy and was a great purchase.,dogs,3
"I bought this and was not aware that it was the U.K. version. However, on my invoice was a nice letter from the shipper. She explained that in case I hadn't noticed, this is the U.K. version, same ingredients, slightly different packaging (actually, I like the U.K. version better). She added that if I wanted to I could return it for a full refund. This made me feel better. I have since tried it on six of my cats and have not seen any of them scratching lately so I presume it worked. Since it is about half of what you would pay for the U.S. version, I think I will stick with this.I just ordered again for the second time and my order arrived very quickly. I had great results with the product last time and you can't beat the price. I have 7 cats, so I have to order every month. This is by far the best deal.",cats,2

"This has worked wonderfully for my year-old Belgian Sheepdog, who will keep himself busy with it for quite long periods. I have hard floors, so simply nosing the toy isn't enough to make it tumble and dispense kibble, but he's learned to use his paws and nose to turn it from side to side and get his food. It's been fascinating to watch him puzzle out how it works, getting more sophisticated in his technique over time. It's very tough and takes lots of biting, pawing, and bashing around without showing any signs of wear. He's worked out how to pick it up and drop it, too. Some dogs will love this and others just won't have the patience for it, but the price is certainly reasonable enough to give it a try.",dogs,3
"DO NOT BUY THIS HARNESS!!!I have purchased two of these harnesses and am extremely disappointed. My dog was able to chew through both of them in absolutely no time at all. Very poor quality.I have a daschund-German Shepherd mix, aka a dog that sits low to the ground with a lot of pulling power. I was excited to find this harness so that I can feel comfortable taking him for a walk while pushing a baby stroller.So I bought the first one. One the SECOND walk, it snapped. Thankfully my husband was there and we were able to quickly connect the leash to his collar and he didn't get away. We were on a busy street and I am horrified to think what could have happened if he had more quickly realized that he was no longer attached to the leash. At the time, I assumed that the harness was somehow too big and that that allowed him to chew through it. That seemed strange, though, because we do not leave our dog in the harness. Instead, we put it on him before going out for a walk. So he really had no time to chew on it.So I bought the second one. This time, following the SECOND walk, it snapped. I know how long it took for him to chew through it--less than two minutes. When we arrived home from the walk, I immediately went upstairs and changed our daughter's diaper. My plan was to quickly change her and then come downstairs and remove the harness. Our dog came upstairs while I was changing her and the harness was dangling around him. Again, the amount of time that he was wearing the harness out of my sight was less than two minutes. In that time, he was able to chew through and break it.I am very upset because these harnesses are not cheap and now I have wasted money on two of them. Additionally, I still do not have a safe way to walk my dog while pushing my daughter in her stroller.My recommendation",dogs,3

"got this ball for the turbo scratcher. they go through stages where they like toys for a while, then don't touch them for a long time. i got this ball the other day and it seemed to renew some interest in the turbo scratcher. they also like to play with the ball just by itself. i placed it in the turbo scratcher track along with the white ball the TS comes with. they like both of them in the track and when they hit each other it creates a sound they try to recreate. honestly their favorite toy still is the cat dancer, go figure, and it's the cheapest of all their toys they have. of course you have to actually have to ""play"" with them but they really love it. this ball here shipped very quickly. i think if your cat loves the TS they will love this. my boys were never a huge fan of the TS so i'm not sure it will hold their interest for too long but they do walk by and hit it from time to time.",cats,2

"I bought this hoping it would better deal with one of my cat's smelly output than clumping litter. It does have a better rake movement than the Littermaid (this replaced a 7-yr-old Littermaid), it was very easy to clean the frame, and it dealt with smell well. Unfortunately, my 23 lb cat seems to have a bladder the size of a grapefruit, and I found that I had to change the trays too often for my pocketbook. The cartridge was also too big for my small, narrow garbage bin, making it a challenge to get rid of -- I had to put it in a big plastic bag and bend it in half lengthwise. (I would have figured out something better eventually...) My big cat also tends to perch on the edges of the litterbox (even though this is generously sized; he perches no matter how big the box is), and sometimes he'd knock off the purple lid that lifts to trap the scooped stuff. Easy enough to replace, but the clatter always scared him and I was worried he'd stop using it. I do think it's a well-designed product, just not for big beasties like mine.",cats,2
I purchased this 4 months ago and it sits in my fridge-a complete waste of money. 2 cats are over 10 years old and 2 are under 2 years old. One of the 10 year old cats was around 2 living on the street when I found him. The 2 younger cats were betweeen 3-4 months old also starving in the streets when I took them in. They are all fixed/micro-chipped and after their experience not really fussy what they eat. NOT ONE SINGLE CAT will TOUCH this stuff. I cannot hide even a little bit in their beloved canned Fancy Feast as they will completely ignore it and just eat the dry cat food. I am going to give it to my friend who has a dog. Maybe she will have better luck. I do not recommend this product.,cats,2

"The way this thing turns on and off is ridiculous! There is no power on button or switch. You have to program the time. Then you program when you want it to turn on. Then you program when you want it to turn off. BUT... then you must wait until the current time passes the ""on"" time before it will be on, even if your current time is between the on time and off time to begin with. When I first set mine, the current time was 2pm. I set it to come on at 7am and go off at 5pm so I assumed this would power the unit on and I could begin making the sensitivity adjustments. Wrong. I couldn't start making the adjustments until the next day. How ridiculous is that? A simple on/off switch would be better for most people. Also, the way the programing works is that you can not change only one time. For instance, say you realize that you need to change the ""on"" time, but that the current time and off time are correct. It doesn't matter. You must go through the whole sequence, setting the time, the on time and the off time all over again.I was so disgusted that I couldn't just turn it on, that I immeditely returned it. So I can't tell you how well it works if it's actually ever turned on. I never got that far with mine.",dogs,3

Loaded up with the right sized kibble it's a great indoor toy during the winter when our 50 pound four year-old is inside most of the time. We've found that the size of the treat is important as too small will easily fall out and too large will lead to frustration and cause his interest to fall off after awhile. Also, the Amazon price was considerably better (about 20% less) than we found locally when free shipping was factored. I Recommended it highly.",dogs,3

"*For those who say the fleas returned, you HAVE to get rid of the fleas in your whole house and even spray the yard if they are bringing them in from outside. This is awful expensive if you don't plan on taking care of the infestation! Also, its great for preventing fleas from coming back, especially during the summer months*Now, we moved into a new house and my cat began 'hiding out' and shedding more then usual. She didn't really want to be touched or handled and was completely withdrawn. Then we noticed the scabs all over her back and neck. Sound familiar? She was having an allergic reaction to fleas that were in our new home. We didn't find the cause until our white ferret was completely infested :( A few days after treating my cat and my ferret, our cat climbed into my lap for the first time in months. Her scabs are healing, the shedding stopped and she is playful again. My ferret finally has much needed sleep and no more scratching. I haven't seen a single flea on him. Since I didn't see any reviews for ferret owners, I thought I should provide some help. Although Frontline has not been specifically tested for use in ferrets. Frontline is the product most highly recommended for ferrets by veterinarians. The Frontline Spray is probably more economical, but its hard to find and both my ferret and cat do not like being sprayed. One dose of the Frontline Plus (top spot for cats and kittens) is enough for 2 ferrets. Use half a dose for your little carpet shark. The other leading brands, like @dvantage, are a little more toxic then Frontline, however, @dvantage can be washed off in case of an allergic reaction. Do not use the cheap spot treatments on your ferret. They can be toxic to your ferret in addition, not as effective. Rev0lution, however, has been tested for ferrets in the kitten dose. It will cure a number of ailments including ear mites and various parasites, but its still pricey in comparison to Frontline. I am totally pleased with my choice to use Frontline Plus. It worked wonders for both our cat and our ferret. With some vacuuming and carpet spray, we are currently flea free, Yippy!",cats,2

"I have 3 adult cats and two Scoop Free automatic litter boxes. When you have multiple cats and regular boxes you must scoop numerous times per day and heaven help you if you are gone all day or over night. These litter refill trays are convenient to use and store. I order them 6 at a time. When they arrive I open all of them and get them prepped (take out cardboard filler, open littter bag and empty into refill box, pop the top on and store them stacked in a closet). So when it's time to change the box (about every 30 or so uses)all I have to do is lift the automated box off the refill, put a lid on the refill box (tape it shut- very important step and pitch it) put the fresh refill down and place the automated box back on top. You must be careful with the automated box because sometimes it gets 'dirty' and you have to wipe it down with clean soapy or bleach water. This system is worth every penny.

"We love this product so much, we bought a second unit. Our cat gained tons of weight while being free-fed. Now we can control when she eats, have it supply a meal at 7:00 a.m. so she's not howling at us to feed her in the morning, and then we have the second feeder open at noon. We feed her wet food, by hand, at night. The problem I had with the other types of gravity units is that 1/4 cup is the minimum allowable. We need to feed her less than 1/4 cup in each of the two daily dry feedings, and this unit allows you to put as little or as much kibble as needed. I have not had any of the problems the other reviewers stated (cat being able to push the tray for another feeding, tray not turning, etc.) The only complaint I have is that the instructions are not that clear and there are no additional trays to purchase while one is in the dishwasher. I bought the second unit so that I just have to fill the trays every four days instead of every two. To clarify the instructions, just plug in the time of day when the feeder is to open. I thought originally that you had to program it for each of the five ""trays"" to open. So, one unit has one time plugged in for 7:00 am instead of five 7:00 am's and the other has noon plugged in once. Tray rotates whatever time(s) you set - not just 12 and 24-hour periods. Hope that helps.",cats,2
"I purchased a BUNCH of AKC dog toys for my beloved pup, as she LOVES to play. There is simply no way my dog can squeak this toy, but she likes the round shape and the hedgehog back. I believe what I have here is a small version, but is still absolutely unsqueakable by my 13lb lhasa apso who plays like there is no tomorrow because of the size of her mouth. However, she does love balls, so I believe the hedgehog does give that attraction. It's also plusher than some of the AKC toys, which I like. Good deal for the price. Great for medium size dogs.",dogs,3

"I used this to keep my large Oscar, large Plecostomus, and Bichir alive for 3 weeks while I took a trip to Europe. One side had my large Oscar pellets which float, while the other side was filled shrimp pellets which sink. When I got back from my 3 week trip, my fish were still alive and doing well.The digital display is nice because you can tell it is on and running. Now that I am back from vacation, I only wish it reported if it worked okay. I sometimes have seen error messages indicating a problem and that the screw needed to be cleared. However, I don't know how long those error messages stay there. It would be nice if I could look at the LCD sometime within the hour it activates to see a message that it activated properly. The fish eat the food quickly, so I am left wondering if they got fed okay.One thing I had to do was cut a plastic cup to form a funnel to make sure the pellets dropped into the aquarium and not spilled outside of it. It would be nice if the item came with some kind of funnel setup that could be cut with scissors to fit most applications. If I could make a funnel tall enough, I would mount this on top of my lighting fixture. The way I have it setup now, the light fixture had to be moved forward on the aquarium top. This keeps me from being able to lift the lid to add food manually without removing the automatic feeder and moving the light fixture back toward the rear.Also, the device tends to push out a lot of food. I have it on its lowest setting, which is suitable but almost too much food.In any case, this automatic feeder did what it needed to do while I was on vacation.",fish aquatic pets,4
WOW! there are a lot of fake reviews on this item. TOTAL PIECE OF TRASH. DO NOT buy this if you have a cat that pees standing up straight out onto the wall. you will be terribly sorry. This thing did not work once for me. Just ended up with cat urine everywhere on the inside and inside the rim and all over the grates and under the grates and it did not sift correctly not once for me. IT IS NOW IN THE GARBAGE OR RECYCLE BIN or whichever i forgot because I tried my hardest to forget this nightmare of a butt box. Total waste of my money (i mean who's going to send back a butt box?) I did buy it at petco and not amazon. I would say only buy this if you have a kitten the squats perfectly and makes perfect little clumps and MAYBE it MIGHT work for you but probably will not last long and will turn into a jammed up mess.,cats,2

"Our lab-mix mutt is pretty hyper, and so we wanted to get her a toy that would challenge her and keep her busy. This ball is perfect for just that. She will push the ball with her nose and follow it around, patiently waiting until a treat falls out. It's so funny to watch her with it and it keeps her busy for up to an hour sometimes. She doesnt get sick of it either. Well worth the price for this toy!",dogs,3
I've had this collar for about a month and have made use of it on several night hikes and walks. I regularly night hike a trail that is pretty deserted so I'm able to let my dog go off-leash. I thought this would be a great way to see where she was. The way the buckle and on/off switch are designed it blocks about 1/4 of the collar's light. If the leash is angled a certain way then it can make it almost invisible from one side. If I didn't see my dog I would call her name and she'd turn and then I'd see the collar.It's been cold and wet here some lately and we've hiked in both conditions and the collar performed without issue. If your dog's neck size is on the upper end of the limits for the size I'd suggest going up a size as mine seemed a bit tight on the sizing.If buying another lighted collar I would likely look at other models due to the amount of light blocked on this one.,dogs,3
"Our dog likes these treats, but it took many weeks to receive the dog treats. To be totally fair, although I ordered the treats May 15, 2010, I received a reply saying that the treats would not ship until as late as September 20, 2010.",dogs,3
Our manecoon cat loves the fountain. She has loved to play in water. We started her when she was a baby kitten. Now she will drink from the fountain and use the water to clean herself. We put it on our Lanai and she has a blast. Money well spent Dee from Florida,cats,2
"I've had one of these fountain for years and it always worked beautifully. Decided to order a second one this summer and discovered the changes for the worse. Seems the new pump is more powerful and NOT adjustable. This results in serious water leakage. I've tried 3 times to purchase and exchange these leaky fountains without luck. They all leaked so badly that my floor was soaked repeatedly and the reservoir was emptied in 2-3 days. Unless the manufacturer makes changes 1. an adjustable pump, 2. extending the interior wall above the pump area to prevent overflow, I won't purchase another petmate fountain. I don't recommend you purchase this either.Time to find a better fountain from a different manufacturer.",cats,2
"I just purchased a medium Furminator dog brush for my Newfoundland puppy. It is tough to use on the finer puppy hair. I am anxious to see how it does as the puppy's coat gets longer.

"My border collie, Carly, is getting older-definitely. Her back legs are giving her lots of problems with long standing-especially on tile floor. Her dish sits on a tile floor. The real problem is when she had to lower her head to eat, which proceeded to pull her whole body down. After seeing a friend's dog table for their dog, I knew it could be just right for our dog. It has worked great for her. She has not slipped down once since we have had it. The quality is very good. The black color is almost classy and the construction is really great with the ability to fold it up for storage.",dogs,3
"I had one of these several years ago and recently replaced it with a new one. It is true that the product quality has declined in recent years. The rake does not reach the bottom of the box any longer; the motor is weaker. Chalk it up to the old ""they don't build 'em they way they used to"" which is true of many products these days. However, this is still WAY better than a traditional box and after much research, I decided that this automatic box (with the modification mentioned below) is the lowest-maintenence option available.Be aware - you will have to check it every 1-2 days to scrape any hardened litter from the bottom, scoop any missed bits, knock bits off the rake if needed, add more litter, and spread the litter evenly. This is NOT a complete litter change - it will take 2-3 minutes and is much less work than manually scooping/cleaning a traditional box. I've had no issues with jamming - I have one small cat, so perhaps the jamming complaints from other reviewers may be attributed either to size/quantity of their cats or overfilling with too much litter - I'm not sure.The recepticals are expensive and have to be changed somewhat often, which is messy. The solution is to apply a VERY worthwhile modification, which will reduce maintenence significantly",cats,2

"I have a cat who would rather die of dehydration than drink out of an ordinary bowl...she is such a princess!! I bought this item from a local pet store and it was WAY more expensive than on Amazon (about $20 more), I wish I had looked here first even though I don't think it's worth the $30 they are charging. I have to say that the fountain is incredibly noisy, whether it is full or not and it is about as equivilant to my cat crying for water from the faucet. Also, if it isn't cleaned every week or so it gets so clogged with gunk that it won't even run and cleaning it is no easy feat. You have to take the whole darn thing apart and the electrical chord isn't detachable. I think the filter is just really a ploy to get you to spend more money becuase it doesn't last more than two weeks even with regular cleaning. My cat loves it though and it is the only product that she will actually use, so it's just one hassle trade off for another.",cats,2

"We bought this ball figuring that it would be a perfect tennis ball for our male Lab and our Saint Bernard. As soon as the package arrived, my husband gave it to the boys to play with. Of course they instantly loved it, but I noticed tonight when I returned home from work that this ball did exactly what all the other reviews that gave a low score said it would do- under the felt the two halves of the ball have already separated. We haven't even had this for an entire 24 hour period. I specifically bought this ball because it was supposed to offer ""industrial strength"", but if this is their idea of industrial strength, then it sure doesn't match my own. Needless to say, I won't be wasting my money on another of these. If you want a great ball that your dog will love that holds up to a Lab with OCD and a behemoth Saint Bernard, then spend a few bucks more and order the Holee Roller.

It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight.

"In August, I went out of town and made the mistake of taking my 14-yr-old Llasa to a kennel that has the connotation of a heavenly pet resort (referred by groomer), but was the worst nightmare. After just 3 days, my poor dog was bleeding in one paw, almost blinded, and walked as though he was crippled. Yes, he already had poor eyesight but had no signs of bleeding or trouble w/ walking before going to the kennel.If it was not for Amazon and the customer reviews, I don't know how I would have nursed him back to health. I immediately took him for a bath, faithfully cleaned his eyes and used iDrops, and gave him Nutramax Cosequin DS daily. Soon, he no longer bumped into the piano or kitchen cabinet and he was walking better. After 4 weeks, he now just jumped over the threshold after being in the backyard. The hardwood floor is still hard for him to negotiate; he slips now and then, esp. when excited. But he is no longer sagging at the hips as though he was in pain. I could see the improvement after feeding him the Cosequin 2-3 weeks. Too bad it took several days for me to find Cosequin and for it to get here. But it was well worth the wait.Even though I took him to the vet immediately upon my return, they just said he was old and there was nothing they can do. How sad that they do not even know about the wonderful products on Amazon. At first, a couple of people even told me to put him down so he will not suffer the (leg) pain. I was horrified and saddened, and of course could not do it without trying everything I can. SOOOOOOOOOO glad I found Nutramax. With proper care, I think he still has a few good years left.And, please!!!, check out kennels thoroughly before you put your pets there. They are helpless against abusive or indifferent caretakers. It's sad to say that the neighborhood it's in also can be a factor--I should have trusted my gut instinct instead of relying on a referral.

"I have purchased too many scratching posts in the past that my cats simply didn't like for one reason or another. Some were flimsy and many tipped over too easily. And there were a few others that were angled in one odd way or another, causing my cats to reject them from the start. Add to this string of failures my realization that by providing carpeted scratching posts, I've really only been training my cats to tear my carpet apart.Then I found this scratching post and much to my amazement, my cats immediately began using it and they continue to come back for more throughout each day. I rubbed catnip into it first, as I've done with all previous failed scratching post purchases, but this time my cats took to it immediately.This thing is huge compared to any other scratching post I have ever seen. It's very tall and I think that's extremely important because it gives the cat plenty of room to stretch upward as he scratches so, for the cat, it is very comfortable to use. It is not covered in carpet but rather is covered in a very sturdy sisal material. Assembly was very quick and easy (about two minutes).Finally, after observing my cat's reaction to this scratching post it dawned on me that each of my cats have different scratching habits. For instance, my female Manx and self-appointed Queen wouldn't be caught dead scratching in a very lowly horizontal position, so this upright post suits all of her royal needs perfectly. My two male cats enjoy scratching vertically and horizontally so, for instance,prior to buying this post they would have a rip-roaring great time scratching the entire front of the arms of my sofa then blast off (woo-hoo!) to the master bedroom where they would stretch out horizontally while giving the carpet a loud and very disturbing series of hard ""rip-rip-rips!!!"" before collapsing in a sort of vandalism-fueled euphoric pre-nap heap on my bed. (Hmmmm, cat owner, thy name is sucker.) Because two of my hooligans like to scratch horizontally too, I also bought the horizontal scratcher that is available from this manufacturer. It's also covered in sisal material and in our situation having both available to them is working out beautifully for us. Let's face it, cats are among the most pompous, diabolical creatures on earth. It's nice to have the upper hand now and then.While it's true that my cats still look down their noses at me, their lowly servant, they now behave in a way that we can all live with and that makes this money well spent.",cats,2

There is one located on the corner wall leading into my room, one I placed on a different cat tower she has where she had torn some of the sisal rope and made it look like new again. The fourth one i placed on her favorite window and as she watches the birds, squirrels and other life outdoors she can brush her head and body around the frame of the window and massage her face and body. She seems to be very pleased with the variety of locations I placed them in and uses them regularly. I am pleased that she has chosen to use them and allow me the sleep I need at night, after all I'm not a cat and need a little more than a catnap to survive the day. I'm certain most cats will enjoy them as well. To add variety inside, sometimes I replace the catnip with honeysuckle that cats love as well. You might try it if your cat does not like catnip, I haven't met a cat that didn't adore honeysuckle!",cats,2
"I fell in love with this jazzy, black and silver metallic, leopard pattern leash while shopping in a local pet store but was disappointed that the store did not offer matching collars that would fit my dog, Wandrdog. Luckily Amazon offers a large assortment of products by the manufacturer Lupine and I was able (with some hunting) to find the perfect pattern (""Wild Thing"") in the styles and sizes Wandrdog needed.Lupine offers leads in three widths (1/2"", 3/4"", 1"") and in three lengths (2', 4', 6'). I selected the 3/4"" wide, 6' length and found it perfect for my 25lb dog. I also selected a martingale-style collarLupine 3/4"" Wild Thing 14""-20"" Combo Collar, 3/4"" W, 14""-20"" Neckin a matching pattern.This lead is extremely well made from tightly woven, jacquard nylon webbing. Unlike other manufacturers, Lupine's designs are woven into the webbing and not printed or sewn on top. The metal fitting that attaches to the collar is a welded, zinc-plated reverse-gate, swivel clip that is very strong and secure. (Another reviewer has commented that the clip is small and difficult to use. This is not the case with my leash; the clip is quite large and sturdy and easy to use because you push against it to open and close the latch.) The handle is padded and comfortable to hold.Lupine manufactures its products in Conway, New Hampshire and offers a life time guarantee.....even if chewed. This guarantee is reassuring as Wandrdog's former leash has been well gnawed and patched twice.",dogs,3
"We have had large and medium sized Coolaroos out in our dog run for several years now. They are the perfect solution for your dog's comfort outdoors. The dogs love them and it keeps them off the wet, cold concrete. As long as you don't have a puppy that wants to chew, this product will last a long time out in the elements. Our puppy chewed ours, but what can you expect...he was chewing everything. Now he is out of that phase and is leaving the Coolaroo alone (except to sleep in it!).In response to some previous reviews, you can find replacement covers for these beds at several other online merchants if you just spend a minute or two searching. Admittedly, these beds are a little tough to get the last bolt in place. That is the point though- the mesh fabric initially has to be very tight. As soon as the dog lays in the bed for the first time, the fabric loosens a bit and it is perfect.",cats,2
"I like it, my puppy likes it. The size is good enough to last into his adulthood, I think. The material is nice and bright and it stays open with no problem but you can fold it flat if you want to. Top folds over and ""locks"" with velcro. Top and sides are a layer of cloth and the bottom is reinforced.I'm finding him teething on the corners, making a lot of noise but so far no damage. And if he gets it on it's side, he'll crawl into it to nap as if it was an open crate. I recommend it.",dogs,3
"I am very impressed with the Furminator. Someone I konw demonstrated one on a dog and I had to have one. I have a Sable Sheltie and the first time I used it I got a shopping bag full of hair from her. I use it on her a couple times a week and no shed hair around any where. I have to agree with what one lady said though. That's the price, it is a little high. Also i didn't know You could get replacement blades. Don't believe that was mentioned when got it. Over all it does a fantastic job.",cats,2

She doesn't associate it with food no matter what I do.",dogs,3
"The littermaid has saved me from cleaning the cat box every day (I have three cats). My cats hated the ramp, peed on the rug and never ever used it (they enter from the side) so I tossed it, but it's just fine without ramp. While it is rather noisy when it rakes, the littermaid is a delight to have for a scooping service. It actually works quite well but you're still going to have to clean between the rakes to get the stuck poops out every now and then. Oh, and cleaning it is a nightmare, but still a million times better than dealing with a manual box. My cats love their littermaid especially because their litter is always nice and clean for the most part. Try to reuse the receptacles because they are a rip-off (hot sudsy water will do )and read the manual so you don't break the machine, and you will be glad you got it. Don't expect a miracle. There simply is no miracle answer to cat toilets. Just love the fewer days spent dealing with the litter mess!",cats,2

my dog has nerves and wants to itch and chew......the cone keeps him from a frenzy somewhat! If not for the cone he would go to town on his entire body drawing blood....however he is a contortionist and can maneuver the cone. The picture shows a black band around the diameter of the large end of the cone this is not the case in the cones we received as we purchased 2....the cone is exposed plastic and is sharp so if he runs in to our legs it hurts a little and he can also scratch himself with it like a back scratcher....I can imagine how good it must feel I almost hate to get on him about it. All in all it does serve it's purpose because without it like I said he would be in a frenzy from nerves he would chew him self bloody my only disapointment was the pictured item was not was was shipped.,dogs,3
My cat loves it! She was so happy when I sprinkled it on her scratching post.,cats,2
"I purchased this product in spite of contradictory reviews because I have a fox terrier who shedding is a real problem. He sheds his coat constantly. The furminator has slowed his hair loss on peoples slacks and when he rubs against the furniture. It has helped us when nothing else, any other produce or tool made any difference. A bonus is that it has also helped to control cat hair from the cat I inherited from my grand-daughter. When brushing the cat here hair would just fly all over me and the floor or couch, any place it wanted to go. Very uncomfortable when it flew into your face. Consequently no one wanted to brush her. The teeth of the furminator hold the hair better to allow removing a wad and putting it in the wastebasket. This was such a pleasant surprise and I would have purchased this tool for this reason alone. It also helps the cat with less massive hair balls.I am very happy with the furminator, the speed which I received it and the purchase price.Thank you",cats,2
This coat is great. I had a shearling before but it was so stiff I think my little yorkie found it uncomfortable. This one is much softer and he loves it.It runs larger than expected though.,dogs,3
"The FURminator is a winner. Using a GENTLE touch you can easily gather and dispose of excess dog hair. It may seem like lots of money but it's worth it compared with alternative techniques. My only caution is don't get more width of FURminator than you need. Also, the edges are sharp so keep the plastic protector on when not in use. A rubberband would be a good idea as the plastic doesn't stay in place on it's own. Go Fur it !",cats,2

"Paws down, the very best cat toy in the world! Our cats are addicted to Da Bird - they simply must play with it every day or they sulk. Our vet used to sell them years ago, but then she retired. I was thrilled to find Da Bird on Amazon.com. (So were our cats!) The amazing configuration of feathers on this toy actually makes a noise similar to a flying bird, and this is only one of the many reasons why Da Bird is the best cat toy out there. Other reasons include",cats,2
"It gets pretty cold where I live and my house is ancient. So while I sleep under an electric blanket, I thought the cat would appreciate something similar.

"I've always been a dog person and they end up as part of the family. This time I skipped the pure breeds and went for a shelter puppy. They said he would get to be a large dog. This is somewhat of a mistaken statement as I adopted a small pony (love him to death). Even though he is getting really large and is still a puppy, this will be the last crate he needs. It is a large crate and was the best price you could imagine here on Amazon. I specifically wanted the crate with only one door (just don't think there needs to be 2 unless you want to put the side door as the main one). Highly functional and sturdy? Yes. Highly portable? Not at all. It does fold up and become somewhat portable but expect it to be large still. I have no complaints or regrets with this purchase and I really doubt anyone else will either.",dogs,3

"I have one cat, and we had issues with the stink. Once I purchased the ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box that went away. Now I don't have to be embarrassed when friends come over. My cat also finds it amusing every time it self-cleans. I will say, she did have a hard time adjusting to the new liter box, I do recommend following their instructions on how to transition them to the new box. I don't think I can recommend this for a multi-cat home, because the refills are so expensive. However, for my situation, it is worth every penny!",cats,2
"Kittens may find this toy fun, but only three of my five adult cats were mildly curious at first and lost interest quickly. The lure on its string slides onto the end of the rotating stem and is held in place by pressure. After a few minutes, the device tends to fling the lure loose from the stem. There is no automatic shut-off when this happens, so someone must supervise the device or the batteries will run down needlessly. I plan to give the toy to someone with a kitten.",cats,2

"We used this on our puppy. We were living in a condo and our puppy couldn't hold it long enough to go down the elevator (of course!). We were using puppy pads, but he would step on the urine and poop especially when we praised him afterwards, he would get excited and just mess it all up. To top it off, he would run to the puppy pad, but would go on a corner of the pad and get urine all over the floor. We couldn't fault him for trying though!With the wizdog, he knew exactly where to go! I think it was helpful it was raised a bit so he knew where the boundary of it was, so he would usually run to the center of it and go!We would use the puppy pads underneath the grate and it would be easy cleanup. Couple things to watch for -- sometimes the poop gets stuck in the grid, so it's a bit of a hassle to clean if it goes into the grate, so keep a toilet brush handy. Second tip, if you put it on top of a floor that's slippery (we placed our on top of tile), our puppy would run to it, and it would slide, so we ended up putting those non-slip mats underneath to prevent the wizdog from sliding.We used this for a good 3-4 months until we knew for sure our dog could hold it longer, and we transitioned him to going potty outside. This was a great transitionary help for us!!!!",dogs,3
"This is a nice, scenic addition to my turtle aquarium and has plenty of flow and filtration for my needs. The only thing, my baby sliders have a hard time climbing up the sheer face to get to the basking platform. It usually takes them several tries.

If you have a Cat Genie then you are familiar with the granules. These are simple plastic non-toxic pellets that go in the Cat Genie. They do exactly what they are supposed to do which is serve as a resting place for your cat and his/her leavings. The Cat Genie cleans these granules effectively and automatically so until your cat kicks them all over the place and/or they get washed away slowly there is nothing to do with them. Every so often you'll have to top off your Cat Genie with more granules and that is why they sell these boxes.,cats,2

"Don't let the cost of this litter box deter you if you don't want to scoop litter. If I had only known about this 5 years ago, I would have saved myself $2500. That's what I've spent on three automatic litter boxes and the cost of replacing a hardwood floor from one of them leaking egregiously. (don't let anyone tell you that crystals can soak up urine for 30 days)I've had a cat for thirteen years and I have tried everything. I was ready to resign myself to going back to good old scooping when I found this and it was my last ditch effort for scooping freedom. My place wreaked of urine from the last electric litter box that was impossible to clean. I plugged in the Litter Robot next to the other one and the smell was gone. I was shocked - and thrilled, of course.My cat's been using it for two weeks now. It's so easy to empty the clumps and it doesn't appear that the robot will need to be cleaned very often.

"OMG the quality of this laser is EXCELLENT. I have had so many others with problems like the clicker breaking,the batteries being such a pain not to mention how many little watch batteries you have to put in the others. This one takes ONE batterie and when you order it a heck of a deal on the same size batteries shows up so you can order more for like $3 for 5 MORE batteries that is way cheaper than the stores carry. FREE shipping let me tell you for $4.25 I am completely satisfied. My cats all 4 love the laser so when the batteries in the other were such a pain as far as replacing and screwing the cap on just right so the batteries would connect and it would work you would get little or NO laser. Very cheaply made the others for the same price or more. This one even comes with LED torch I had no idea. That is very bright and helpful on those nights when you need to check on things without turning on bigger lights. It doesn't look like the picture,but who cares any cat lover would be delighted in the quality and management of this one.

We have one in the butterfly pattern as well, but this sea glass pattern is our absolute favorite.

"What an amazing product. I used it on my 6 month old Cocker Spaniel for the first time two months ago and I couldn't be happier. It took a few minutes for her to get used to the strap on her snout, but after pawing it and rubbing her face along the floor I was able to connect a leash (not included) and start walking. The video and the print instructions included with the Gentle Lead are very helpful and easy to understand. Now, my pup walks at my side, heels and is generally more behaved when we're in public. I figure I'll start transitioning back to a traditional collar and leash soon.The Gentle Lead is well made and hasn't faded yet (I got the red one), but it has started to fray,thus the reason for four stars. I doubt it'll break under the strain of my 12lb puppy's pull, but I don't feel after eight weeks of prescribed use it should be coming apart already. Not sure if there's a warranty -I generally don't pay attention to that kind of stuff, but I'd definitely lay out the money for another Gentle Lead if this one frays through before my pup is ready to behave in a collar.",dogs,3
"We discovered that our eight year old Lab, a rescue dog, loves squeaky toys and doesn't destroy them. He likes the AKC Duck best but this CANADA (not Canadian, please!) Goose is also a winner. For some reason the rabbit, which has been panned by other reviewers, did not squeak after the first day. Instead it feels like there is a plastic bag in its belly that crinkles.If your dog likes to tear toys apart, these are too easily destroyed. Try the Kyjen Hard Boiled Softies Dog Toys instead. The Hedgehog we have is loud and tough. The rubber shell makes it fun to throw as it is heavy and bouncy.",dogs,3
"I found these treats via my vet's office (it is a very highly rated vet in Tampa, FL). They keep a jar of them in each exam room as treats to give the pups during or after shots and exams, etc. My 6-month old Pomeranian reacted in a much more exciting manner than with any treats I had at home, so I found out what they were and went hunting for them on Amazon for a better price.The treats are in the shape of a 1-inch square shape and are semi-soft and kind of thick, so I tend to break off a piece here and there as a treat for my little guy. An entire square means he's been VERY good. These things smell AMAZING, just like beef jerky I'd eat. The smell is strong enough where you will attract any dog who is within a few feet of you. You will also want to wash your hands after handling the treats... the yummy smell will stay on you.Lamb is just YUM! My pup gets bored of beef and chicken products... probably because his food is beef, and lots of his other treats or toys are beef or chicken flavored. Something different like this lamb flavor really makes it a special treat.The best part about these are that they are made with real lamb & are healthy for your dog. I don't feel guilty giving him these. They are all natural, holistic and do not contain any chemical preservatives.

I know the DVD says to take a short first walk but we just walked in the park for 25 minutes because they were being so good!! There are ducks and squirrels in the park, which usually mean I get yanked every which way but this time, gentle pressure on the leash and they got to calmly walk up and sniff the (way too brave) ducks without scaring them off!It's like I have different dogs, seriously. There was only minor complaining about the weird thing on their heads and otherwise....angels. Doggy angels. Amazing.",dogs,3
"I have five cats at home, so needless to say, our catboxes are always full and in demand. After conducting a lot of research about electronic catboxes, I settled on the LitterMaid LME9000 (I needed a big one, because my cats are huge). It was a fantastic choice. After trying out the box, my cats will not go in their other boxes. For some reason, they just love the electronic box, probably because it keeps the litter clean at all times. I swear, this litterbox is constantly self-scooping because my cats are constantly going to the bathroom in it.

"I first bought this product in March after battling nasty Asian Tiger mosquitoes all last summer. I live near Washington DC right next to Rock Creek, and these awful biters were making it impossible for my kids to play outside---we'd get bit 3-4 times just going from the driveway to our front door every evening.Due to the warmer-than-average spring, I started scattering these granules all throughout my lawn and in every possible crack and intersection of roots that might hold water after a rainfall. Combined with additional birdfeeders and planting marigolds, rosemary, and geraniums, (and dumping out containers filled with water after rain) we haven't seen a single mosquito yet, even after a couple days of 80+ weather in April and May. I usually re-apply every 2 weeks or after a soaking rain, and the 30-oz. size lasted through about a month and a half---so environmentally safe AND cheaper than hiring a company to come and chemically treat several times during the summer.I know the skeeters are out in other areas, and I just bought a jug for my son's daycare because he was sent home covered in bites yesterday. I'll come back and give this 5 stars if we can make it through the summer without being eaten alive like last year.",dogs,3

Well, over a week later it still looks like new even though she has it out constantly and has been driving me crazy with the squeaker. She just loves it and never forgets where she left it. We will be buying more of these in the future. Also, I like the fact that is a bit larger than a regular tennis ball eliminating the risk of choking.",dogs,3

I recently started calling local shelters to ask who they contacted when the find a pet with a microchip. I have always registered my pet with AKC-CAR even though they are mixed breeds and felt confident that any shelter would contact AKC-CAR as it is a large national registry. I was very distressed to learn that at they call the company who sells the chip but out of 10 shelters I contacted only one calls AKC-CAR. I am calling all those shelters again and asking that they add AKC-CAR to their call list as with the one time fee and ease of updating information it is still a registry I really appreciate. However I am also going to register my pets with Home Again but decline the yearly renewal. Home Again tells me the renewal is for the extra services and that the first registration fee keeps my pet's information in their registry for life if any on should ever contact them looking for the owner.,dogs,3

"I have owned two of these...the first was replaced for free by Walmart where I purchased it for the same price as here. They are complex structures and I cannot imagine anyone who is not a handy man owning one for long. I am and I find it a very poor implementation of a good design idea.The good...it works and it keeps the bin ready for the next use.The bad...it does not work for long before things get weak and then ultimately break it. The thing still gets messed up and cleaning all the little corners and angles is a dirty job and it cannot be done with a hose because all the electronics are not protected in any way from water. It is not a substitute when one goes away for more than 2 days. I have two cats using this and not full time. I needs to be emptied every two days. You must use good quality clumping litter. The replacement canisters are expensive if you do not reuse them. In fact, it is cheaper to just use a coventional litter pan and throw away the whole thing litter and all instead of using the refuse containers as throw away items. The lids will fall off and need to be taped in place.My unit burned out when one of the cats pulled out the power cord at the end of the unit. It just kept getting fuller and fuller and I was gone for a few days. Even though it is supposed to be protected from running when blocked, when I returned I found the unit almost extended to the refuse bin and the stupid wire which hangs out in the middle of the box had been tangled by one of the poor cats trying to use the unit when it broke. BAD DESIGN!I am ordering one of the rocking style units and returning my second unit.By the way, the best litter boxes have strong curves at all corners so they are easy to clean. Keep that in mind.",cats,2

"I would give these bags ZERO STARS if I could!The design of these bags has changed and NOT for the better. Now each bag is tough to separate from the roll because the join is curved and poorly perforated. As the bag's length is partly a handle now, each bag is WAY smaller (okay if you've got a tiny dog)! It's easy to ruin the bag you are removing as well as the next bag. Really hard to do in a hurry or at night too!They are supposed to be saving on plastic, which sounds like a great idea, but this is a lousy design. BE WARNED!We will be avoiding this bag in the future. What a pity we got a pantry pack!",dogs,3
"I bought this in Nov. 2006 and it was FANTASTIC. I had a cat visiting my porch and tormenting my indoor cat. He was clawing and cutting my screens and making us BOTH crazy! The CatStop did the trick, keeping not only him away, but all the neighborhood cats far out of my yard. I'd know when the battery had died because he'd suddenly show up again. But recently it's had less of an effect and I notice that the unit does not react to the full range of angles it once did, even though I've never moved the unit from its original spot. It used to react to the slightest movement and now I have to get right up on it before it goes off. I'm in contact with the vendor to see if they will replace the unit since they say they offer a two-year warranty.",cats,2
This product comes with a pack of squirrels and also the log. This is a bargain! I have two 70 pound dogs and they just love this thing. They will fight over the log and go after the squirrels when they fall out during the tug of war. Everything is well made to stand pulling and biting!,dogs,3
"I have two cats and one of them has a habit of chewing up and eating the toys he likes to play with. Any cat parent knows that this isn't a good thing. We've been lucky enough that he's never managed to make himself seriously ill by doing this although I've had to clean up quite a few kitty vomit messes of many different colors before I determined I can't buy just any toy to leave out for spontaneous play. Forget anything with feathers or fur, they will be quickly eaten. And often when I find a toy that he can't chew up enough to eat, he's not very interested in it. A few years ago, my sister bought this toy as a gift for my cats and they both absolutely loved it! They play with it all the time and it's still in one piece. We actually find it at the top of the stairs in the morning even when it was put away in the kitty toy box the evening before. My cats aren't declawed either, so I am truly impressed with this toy. It is starting to look ratty, so I'll be getting some replacements, but I'm thrilled to have found a toy they love so much that is still in one piece after my monster eating machine cat has played with it for years!",cats,2

"The unit attached firmly to the inside of the aquarium using the included suction cup. The numbers on the thermometer are very small and are difficult to read. However, there is a broad green stripe on the thermometer which covers the ""typical"" temperature range for fresh water tropical fish, so it is usable. It is just very difficult to know if the temperature is 76 or 78 or 80, since the numbers are very small. If you need a low cost thermometer, this may meet your needs, but you better have very good eye sight if you plan to ready the numbers.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I am very happy with this car/bed/seat. My little guy is 10 pounds and settled right in. He especially loves the fleecy lining. I bought the medium size to ensure he would have enough room to lie down and stretch out, plus there's enough room for two small dishes and chewy toys.The reason I bought it was for safety--especially the driver. I think it is too dangerous to have a dog moving around the interior. Two times when I stopped short, he flew from the backseat, between the front seats, and ended up smashing into the gearshift and console. I didn't want to spend so much for a doggie carseat (more than a baby's!), but the second time that happened, I ordered it right away and didn't take him in the car until it arrived. I ordered on a Tues. and it was delivered on Friday--with free shipping. The Amazon price is the best, but the only colour offered is black. Peluche is a white toy poodle so the black is what I wanted, anyway.Peluche + Snoozer carseat = traveling perfection!",dogs,3

I finally broke down and purchased chemi-clean. Worked like a charm. I was very careful to follow the directions and under dosed my tank just a little bit. Cyano was gone in a few days. It's come back once since and chemi-clean worked like a charm again. Just need to determine the root cause.",fish aquatic pets,4

"My dogs are both pullers (large aussie mix and a greater swiss mountain dog). This harness is great for smaller dogs, but mine are 70 and 110bs.

I must say that you should have a professional teach you how to use a prong collar correctly. I won't let my mom use it when she takes one of them for a walk because she's a spaz with it and incorrect use can hurt the dog and confuse them.",dogs,3
"We purchased this crate as an economical way to move two cats across country. We're currently preparing to be moved by the military from the Raleigh, NC area to Las Vegas, NV. The military will move our house hold goods but not our vehicles or pets, which leaves us forced to move the cats by car and SUV. After researching airline tickets to fly the cats, we were looking at nearly $1,000 to move them. For this crate at less than $100, we're now looking at only a fraction of the cost.Our trips to the vet, only 5 miles away have proven nerve racking because the cats are uncomfortable in our smaller, plastic pet carrier. After the 10 minute trips to the vet filled with high pitched meowing, more like shrill feline cries of impending doom, we decided we needed to purchase something different for the upcoming 4 day road trip. We then tried a larger crate that allowed room for the cats to travel together, which has greatly reduced the amount of noise they make while in the car together. This has made the trips to the vet much more pleasant but still isn't practical enough for our upcoming move.After measuring the cargo capacity of our Toyota Rav 4, we finally decided on the 42""x28""x31"" crate. This size allows room for both cats to lay down without being on top of each other, and room for a litter box for their long journey. We unpacked and assembled the crate when it arrived and found a center divider panel that can turn this large crate into 2 separate compartments for smaller puppies, I presume. Instead of making 2 smaller compartments, we turned the divider sideways and zip tied it in place to make a nice elevated shelf, which essentially adds about 50% more space for them to sprawl out! We still have about 1 month before we move but we've already set the crate up and put their bedding and an empty litter box in the crate so they can get accustomed to it before the move. So far they love it, and I've uploaded an image showing the set up.As far as the construction of the crate, it appears very well built and sturdy and I have no concerns as far as packing light items on top of the crate during the move. It will not serve us any purpose once we get to the other side of the country, but for now it is the most economical and least stressful way we can find to move two cats 2,500 miles by car.",dogs,3

If you have an indoor cat than you need this brush. I couldn't believe the amount of fur that was removed from my short-haired pet. Gentle on the pet's skin and my 6 year old cat really enjoys being brushed by it. I have minor allergies and this really seems to help keep them at bay.,cats,2

"Last year we took in a rescue and she decided to protect her new home by barking at any noise, people walking by with dogs, no dogs, strollers...anything. When it was not the by-passers then the squirrels in the trees. We have another 6 year old who never was a big barker, and so there were no problems with neighbors. Since nothing seems to work (click/reward system, being firm) we decided to go with a bark control collar. As we thought using a e-collar for a rescue, who just moved in new surroundings is too much.The first time she barked with it, she was startled by the citronella and stopped. Wow, we thought, maybe that will do it. Unfortunately it didn't, she would bark right through it. The whole house would smell like citronella. Another problem was that it would go off when our second dog would bark, punishing her for no reason.If you have a dog with hyper personality, you might be wasting your money.",dogs,3

"We have a new German Shepherd puppy and we quickly learned that an intelligent puppy means a puppy that gets into trouble when she's bored. She would also scarf down all her food, promptly followed by a hacking cough each time. I wanted to find something to entertain her while at the same time slow down her eating to a healthier pace. The Omega Ball is PERFECT for both of these issues. It is just the right size that I can pour her entire meal (she is fed a little over one cup, three times per day right now) into the ball and it will keep her busy for a good 10-15 minutes. I usually break up pieces of a treat and mix that in with her regular food for extra motivation and fun. She caught on immediately and was pushing it around with her nose and stopping it just before it would get stuck behind a chair or in a corner and pick it up to carry it back to the middle of the room. I can say with complete confidence that she really enjoys the ball even several weeks after receiving it and daily use. Our other furbabies, a 3-year-old golden retriever and malamute, also enjoy the ball. The only issue we've had is having only one and the dogs not wanting to share with each other! The food is very easy to pour in, even for a larger sized kibble, and is easy to empty out if there is any remaining food. Just a few shakes and everything is out. Washing is as easy as rinsing it out and letting it air dry. We don't put any moist foods inside so I think as long as we stick to that we won't need more than a rinse after use. For the price, you really can't beat this for a fun way to slow down your over eager eater. Highly recommended!",dogs,3
When I read previous reviews I was concerned that the box would be too small. If you have a large cat (over 10 pounds) then it might be a little tight in there.The best thing about this box is that that bottom is DEEP.

"As far as litter boxes go, I think that this one is the best value on the market. I use it for my 20 pound gray tabby, and although it took some time for him to get used to it, I think he likes it as well.First of all, the pan on this box is very deep, which helps a lot in keeping my tabby from tracking litter out of the box. To get an idea of how deep it is, the bottom half is the same height as the top half. So make sure you have plenty of vertical space for this box because it will need it.My one complaint is that my tabby, who is incredibly smart, couldn't figure out how to use the hinged door. Plus, the door is constructed pretty cheaply. I removed it and threw it away, but even without the door, the box itself is a pretty good value. The quality isn't the greatest, but it's only $15. It's about what I expected, and as long as it's not moved around a lot, I expect it to work just fine for the long haul.",cats,2
"They're made of a soft, easy-to-squish latex, with at least one body feature on any given animal that ""unrolls,"" kind of like a party horn, when the toy is squeezed. My 10-lb. Coton de Tulear dog could play with one for months without destroying it, but I will say that our son's 24 lb. Border Collie has the unrolling part chewed up in a day. Still, he LOVES these things forever, even without the pop-out nose (or tail, or legs, or whatever) and even long after the squeakers have also gone kaput. His Premier ladybug is over a year old and split down the back by now, but it is still one of his faves...loves to stick his nose thru the split and wear it like a clown.

"Purchased this for my black lab. It was in the trash in a few months. True the item is not padded and its very thin, but after a few weeks it pretty much flattened out to nothing. Should have saved myself the $ and just used a cheap beach towel. At least you can get the hair out of that. I washed this item many times and beat it against the house outside but there was just no way to get out the dog hairs that bad become imbedded in the curly material.Also, this is not an item flaw, but my dog chewed on the outer bumper part and pulled out all the stuffing. If you have a puppy or dog prone to that kind of behavior this is not the item for your.Overall its a waste of money. an old towel will serve exactly the same purpose.",dogs,3
"One of the two collars I received sprayed randomly. The other one didn't during the time I tested them but both went off with head shaking, yawning and sneezing. My dogs were very anxious about the whole experience. I'm being sent replacements. Not sure if they'll be any better.UPDATED:I was sent two new devices that were supposed to have been tested before they were sent. I put them on my dogs, who were extremely anxious (shaking) from the last experience, and waited. I tried to calm them down by feeding treats. One of the collars went off while the dog took a treat. Needless to say, my dog was extremely confused and refused to take any treats for 24 hours after that. I took both collars off. Very frustrating especially since they worked SO WELL in stopping the barking.",dogs,3

"I used this for several weeks without any problems. When I returned home recently, I unhooked it from my youngest dog's harness and went around to the other side of the car to unhook my other dog and then planned to let them both out the same car door. In the maybe 15 seconds it took for me to walk around my car, my youngest dog stepped on the clip part of the harness and her toe and paw pad became trapped in it. I'm not sure how to describe how she was stuck but the tip of the flexible part of the clip was pushing into one of the pads on her paw from the bottom while the heavier curved metal top part pushed down on top of her toe. It took about 20 minutes for me to free her paw from the clip and it was difficult to free her without causing her pain. I ended up destroying the clip in the process. The clip is potentially dangerous, the rest of the belt is fine.",dogs,3
"The general quality is average. I wanted to use on them to restrain a dog inside the house. This wants to attack one of our other dogs. Without going into detail, a sturdy lead is a must. I can only speculate about the sturdiness but I was not impressed. My larger concern was with the sewing.The lead is very inexpensive and probably worth the money for small dogs. I already own two leads by [...] and decided to simply buy two more from them.If you have large dogs and strength is an issue, I would consider the ""fordogtrainers"" approach.",dogs,3
"We own two cats. Two wonderful cats who ache for stimulating play. My husband and I found out recently that the best toy and I mean the best toy is any toy that has string and a toy or lure attached to it. This one - purchased here - definitely gets the job done - with multiple lures - the cats never get board. This is now one of three fishing rods that we use regularly to keep them interested and appropriately stimulated. We also rigged a real fishing pole with a heavier gauge line and the lures from a cat toy fishing pole that broke after about 20 minutes of play. If I ever get my stuff together I will post a video here of my cats having the time of their lives with this toy as well as our homemade version. I have to say - no other cat toy really excites our cats for any length of time. Yes - the cat fishing toys require our involvement and yes it would be nice if someone could invent a fishing pole based cat toy that casts itself but short of this - 15 minutes of playtime with the cats seems a small investment for the pay off. Besides that both my husband and myself have never laughed so hard. Watching them play is great amusement, so its all good for all of us.",cats,2

"I must first say, I own several KONG products and love them all. This brush however is not up to my expectations from KONG. I have a German Short-hair Pointer, and as the name implies he has very fine, short hair. This brush does not pick up his hair as much as it just spreads it all around. For a longer coated dog this would be great (we use to have German Shepherds and Border Collies). But on short hair breads I can't get this to work dry. However, as a shampoo brush, this does a little better on short hair. This does help get out more hair when used as a bath brush, and for that it gets three stars. Again, if you have a longer haired dog, this would probably be great for you, but it does not live up to the product description for short haired dogs.",cats,2
"These things are sooo tiny! I don't know why, but I was expecting something on the bulbous side of one inch, but these are quite tiny and of course make a ton of bubbles.For fresh water applications, this product deserves 4 stars. This assumes that you attach the airstone once (don't constantly connect and disconnect the airline tubing from the stone).When you receive a box of these airstones and first connect them, your impression might be an automatic 5 stars. The water will be bubble-rich. If you run these airstones for a couple weeks and need to disconnect them from their airline, you'll realize they have a 50/50 chance of completely breaking apart in your hand. As far as disconnecting these airstones, I always feel there is a 50/50 chance of them breaking on disconnect (completely crumbling into nothing). IMO they lose a star there.This is where I take another star",fish aquatic pets,4

I already owned two black wire crates for my other dogs (and I thought they were very good quality,) but they were given to me, so I don't know what brand they are. I read many reviews for other crates saying that they were flimsy and arrived bent. The Midwest Life Stages had very few claims of bent crates, so I decided to go with it. It arrived in perfect condition, took some prying to get one of the sides up, and is perfect! There is also a latch to keep the heavy plastic tray from sliding out. Boomer seems likes it and it is definitely big enough. He is 100 pounds, but not overweight at all, so he's a pretty tall boy. I will never buy another brand.",dogs,3

Plastic 'stabilizers' fell of as soon as puppy jumped up against it.The biggest problem however is the bad welding job on the metal mesh, parts are just rough whereas in other areas metal pieces/ particles come of the product, both defects can be damaging to animals imo. The gold-zinc coating is also patchy and comes off on certain spots - rust will likely occur soon!Going to return it to Amazon and trying to find a better product.HE",dogs,3
"Our mastiff had ACL surgery two years ago. As a result of his injury and subsequent surgery, arthritis set in his knee. I began using Synflex and it has worked great. I tried switching to a lower cost K9 liquid glucosamine, but he began favoring the leg as if I wasn't giving him any glucosamine supplement, so we went back to Synflex. I don't know why their formulation works the best, but it does. Our dog will never be without Synflex. I wish they would package it in larger bottles.",cats,2
"When I first got this I had researched it online and I had previously had a Littermaid cat box. So, I had previous experience with being disappointed that I still had so much work to do to keep it running and kepping up with my three cats. When I first set up the Cat Genie it took a while to make sure that it was level and that the basket would spin freely, but after the first night, it worked without a flaw. One of my cat's used it the first night and had no problem with the noise it makes. It isn't any louder than my old self-cleaning litter box. By the second day all three cats were using it and by the end of the first week I put it on auto for two times per day. That keeps it clean and there isn't the work involved in cleaning up bits that the rake leaves in my old box. That said, there are a few negatives; first, there are small bits of solid waste that slip through the hand and remain after the cycle is over. They are very few and no problem to clean up once a week. Second, the litter does get used up faster than I had anticipated due to being pushed up under the rim of the spinning basket and lost down the drain. If they can come up with a way to stop that problem I think that there isn't a more ideal litterbox on the market today. I have reduced my cleanup time by about 95% and the laundry room is always fresh smelling. The other box started to smell after a few days and I had to take it apart and clean it every couple of months in order to keep it working at all. I plan to get the sidewalls as my cats scatter the litter over the floor in their enthusiasm, but not very badly. I am very happy with this product.",cats,2
"I have used nail clippers before normally for large dogs. I have a rat terrier...so about a 20lb dog. These clippers work really well for him, they could be a little more solid, but for the price I can't complain. Would definately buy another pair!",dogs,3
I've had cheaper retractable leashes but they didn't last and didn't work as well. This one was rated well and deserved the high rating. It has been durable so far and the quality seems much higher then other leashes. I would recommend it to anyone with a small dog.,dogs,3
"I had high hopes for this litter box based on the reviews, but this box does not work consistently. If your cat happens to pee too close to the vented side, and I fail to see how this would not happen with every cat at some point, a huge mess is created! The wet litter gets stuck in the vents and the clean litter will no longer pass through smoothly. It took me 45 minutes to scrape the mess out with a screwdriver and then disinfect it and dry it. I rolled and cleaned the box each day, but didn't pick up on this problem for what must have been a few days. You won't necessarily know if this is happening unless you open the box and look each time. Otherwise, if you don't realize the vents are blocked, your poor cat doesn't have as much clean litter as you thought and creates an even bigger mess! Also, if your cat's poop happens to not be thoroughly encased in litter, when you roll the box it is possible for the poop to smear across the top and sides of the box. Your cat then ends up with poop on his or her fur as they move around in the box!! So it can be really nasty for you and your cat in my experience. Because you can't see if anything like this is wrong without opening the box every time and looking, it is totally not worth it. The clips are a pain to open. I had about two weeks before these problems cropped up when the box worked great. So I'm wondering if a lot of these glowing reviews were posted quickly before the owners ran into these issues. I see a few posted follow ups, so maybe I am just unlucky. But really I can't see how a cat would NEVER hit too close to the vents or that poop would not smear at some time. No matter how well your cat covers it up, when you roll the box the stool all gets uncovered; so if the litter doesn't happen to stick completely to the poop, it can create a terrible mess. Finally, the opening is large and litter and dust does spray out the front a bit when you roll it and that is irritating as well. Scooping a regular box is faster and cleaner, and it wastes less litter. Mine's going in the trash.",cats,2

I have a small Shi-Tzu and the vet recommended FrontLine Plus for her. We also used it on our extra-large St Bernard/Golden Retriever mix. It works great. We have never had a problem.,dogs,3
"My cat loved the laser light I would use to play with her. When I wasn't using it she would look at it and at the floor as if to tell me ""let's go already"". Well the laser is now history since I purchased this Cat Dancer. At first I was amazed and delighted how much she loved it and how alive she became. We played and played but when time came to stop she'd have none of it. Every minute she's awake she expects me to play with her using that thing. She's obsessed. This is now her Raison d'etre.",cats,2
"So far it's been 5 months of chewing, burying, clawing and tossing this rabbit; But the little rabbit has held up just fine.Very well built toy for an active dog!",dogs,3
"I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged. I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened. First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing. I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped. Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere. Half of the bottom of the bag was open. I lost at least half of the bag. In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened. It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know. All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store. What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up. I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" or any other type of apology. I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy. I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again. If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA. Buyer beware.",dogs,3
"This product arrived in 2 days! I have a 1 year old, ~60 lb pitbull puppy. I bought his to upgrade from the medium size kennel he grew out of...when he was sitting, his head was touching the top and he was very cramped. I went ahead and ordered the XL to give him another 5 inches or so of head room. I wasn't expecting the kennel to be quite so large, even though the dimensions are in the description. It turns out that it is a great little house for him to be in while I am at school in the mornings. He has plenty of room to lay stretched out on his back with his arms and feet at full extension, just like he likes. He also seems to be much more relaxed now. Although it takes up a lot of space, I am really glad I went for the XL. The quality is very good and I love that it folds up.Our last kennel was one with separate pieces and pins, which I do not recommend. I do wish this one had a side door, but overall i am very pleased.",dogs,3
"I put this on my cat's favorite spot on the couch, and while she initially eyed it with suspicion, she does sleep on it. However, she doesn't sleep there any more or less than before, so I assume she just doesn't care. I'm not really sure if it keeps her warmer or not. At least it keeps her hair off the cushion.",cats,2
"This is by far the worst pet crate I've ever seen.Within 2 weeks of my purchase, the bottom tray broke. My dog was also able to bend the wires to escape from the crate.In all my years as a dog owner, I have never heard of such a thing.If you check out other product review sites for this model you will see this is a common problem.",dogs,3
"We got this rubber chicken for our puppy for Christmas but could not wait so gave it to her right away. Our puppy went nuts and fell in love immediately! So far all of us in the family have had such fun playing with that darn rubber chicken. Holds up well and great toy to throw and catch games, not to mention the NOISE it makes. A riot!!! Sounds extremely loud and sort of like someone is being tortured or something like that. hard to explain but very loud and funny. warning",dogs,3
I thought this would be a great way to train my puppy to ring the chime when she had to go out. I was so excited to get it... and the chime didn't work. Oh Well!,dogs,3

"I have an 8 year-old neutered cat who until I started using Feliway would spray EVERYTHING!! I couldn't stop him no matter how hard I tried, but after just one use of Feliway he stopped spraying. THANK YOU FELIWAY!!",cats,2
"I had one for my min pin to use up his energy and feed him slowly, preventing the inhalation of his meals. I bought some more to give to friends and now for my 5lb toy poodle, she loves it, hours of fun. Perfect for when you're leaving, pop some treats in and leave it for their entertainment.",dogs,3
They do their job. It seems that some are made differently from others. They seem to be made of thinner plastic than others.,dogs,3
"I just got this for my cats and they love it. So simple, but so enthralling. The cats just go nuts over the slightest twitch of the toy.",cats,2
"I bought this to break my lab from running into the street and it worked. This collar has worked for me well. I have only turned it up to 4 and it gets my dog's attention. The ""nip"" button is great. I have also had this collar on her when she was swimming and out duck hunting, no problems. The battery life is also good. I have no complaints so far.",dogs,3
Product has performed as advertised and helped me (beginner with aquariums) establish a new tank with acceptable levels of ammonia etc. I will continue purchasing this product as needed.,fish aquatic pets,4
I bought this for our 11lb cat and it fit great. The hood stayed up and the velcro stayed secured. very good product for the price and the fact she won't wear costumes for a long period of time.,dogs,3
"This is the second Snoozer car seat I've purchased. This one as a gift for my sister and her dogs. Very easy to secure in car. My two dogs, a Jack Russell and Maltese are secure and safe while in the seat. Plus is more comfortable and safe for all of us while driving. They just curl up and sleep mostly but enables them to look out of window if they want.",dogs,3
This is the best birdcage I have ever purchased. It was so inexpensive! It is extremely sturdy and well-made. I bought this cage for my Amazon Parrot. It is a perfect fit for him. It comes with plenty of bowls. I did add perches. The tray is so easy to clean. The doors close securely. It was a little tough to put together. I don't know how other companies can get away with charging so much for cages.,birds,0
"My dog wouldn't touch food that had the Angel Eyes sprinkled on it, despite trying to disguise it in even his favorite food. A waste of money as I will never learn if Angel Eyes really does want it claims.",dogs,3
I have to say at first I was unsure about this product but was desperate for my beagle to stop barking all the time. I thought that she would still be a problem and that I would have to face the facts and give her away.I had tried a shock collar before but she learned to tolerate the pain and howl anyway. I bought the panel and it arrived next day and it was so easy to put together. It only takes a matter of minutes.. I was also unsure if the 4 panels would be big enough but her and our other dog have room to spare and love the play pen. They do not cry or complain at all I have not really had any problems with my beagle. She still barks when people come to the door and when we have thunder storms but other than that I would recommend this for anyone who has a dog that barks a lot and is trying to avoid shock collars.The only problems that I have had is that my dogs can move the pen it did not come with feet to hold it. And my Chion can jump out of it so for smaller dogs I would recommend the topper.Other than that this is a great product! I am very happy with it and would spend the money again in a heart beat.,dogs,3
Well I thought after reading the reviews that I would give this product a try. Well I tried and it failed. The dogs have not slowed down the barking. I would not recommend this product. Very disappointed.,dogs,3

We really love these toys. Our bulldogs play tug with these and they hold up to their ruff play... The two rings we purchased have held up for a long long time. Worth the the price paid for this toy. YES it is an amazingly good toy...,dogs,3
"This was a great cover/pad for my dogs crate. The cover is nice to hide the crate, and the pad inside is nicely padded. I have an older dog so she does not jump or really move around in her crate when she's sleeping. So the bumper (which is held up by velcro) has stayed in place. I can see though how a small puppy or more hyper dog could easily take down the padded bumper when scratching or bitting at it. But there are no problems for me and my dog loves it!!",dogs,3
"I was so proud to get this couldn't wait to show my husband. Having a litter box has been kind of a nightmare for us, we have a senior dog who just won't stay out of it and we have hard wood floors that the sandy litter tears up and of course our cat is a thrower. So I was thrilled with this product cat was using it no problem our old dog couldn't get into it so excited until my husband came home took one look at it and laughed at me. According to him it's a tote with a hole in the top and he could have made it for $4.00. So that killed the awe of it for me. Also as a side note I have a petite cat I can see that this would be a problem for a large cat or even a regular sized one it looks like it could quickly become more crowded then comfortable. My advise buy a tote and cut a hole in the top you can get the right size and the same results!",cats,2
Sprayed it on the newspaper in the driveway & let destructor-dog out. Five minutes late newspaper was all over the yard & I was still trying to get the bitter taste off my fingers. Waste of time and money.,dogs,3

The Easy Walk Harness is a great product. Harness wraps around our dog and provides great control of our 100 lb Alaskan Malamute without ever choking him like other collar-leash combinations. Multiple adjustment points allow for a perfect comfortable fit. Wide range of adjustments allows harness to be used on a growing dog. Great quality. Easy to use.,dogs,3
"I bought the Drinkwell Platinum to replace an original Drinkwell that was wearing out after years of faithful service. The unit is handsome, and I appreciate the larger reservoir, which cuts down on the frequent top-ups. I was also excited that this model has a pre-filter to catch pet hair and other detritus that can quickly muck up the older model.However, the filter presents a new maintenance concern. It must be removed, cleaned, and replaced frequently to avoid a nasty spill. When pet hair collects and blocks the filter, less water is able to circulate, and the reservoir begins to empty to replace what the unit thinks is a low water level. The result is an empty reservoir and a huge water spill out of the main basin.As a result, this model requires just as frequent maintenance as the older model. This isn't a fatal flaw and might not be a problem for everyone (if you have a hairless pet), but buyer beware!",cats,2
"We were amazed right away, It was the easiest assembly ever. And we almost bought the puppy apartment for 3x as much. Thanks",dogs,3
"Granted, being beagles they are not THAT picky about a place to sleep, but my two dogs love these comfy beds. They are easier to keep clean than others I've used. They are machine washable, but that will require a trip to the laundromat unless you own a commercial washer, at least for the large size bed. However, I can get by with vaccuming, then spraying with upholstery cleaner and tossing in the dryer for a few minutes to freshen up. I will have to buy more when these wear out - the pups would never settle for a plain old dog bed again.",dogs,3
I think my dog thought it was too heavy and didn't like the texture so I couldn't get her to play with it.,dogs,3
"I was very disapointed with this purchase. I had two many years ago on a marine 55gal. I am now running a 29 gal fresh and am pretty heavily stocked so I figured I use the old standby. This filter was extremely loud. Not water running loud but mechanical vibration loud. I leveled it, pulled the impeller out a few times to check for problems, nothing. After doing a little web research I found they pretty much just don't make them how they used to. I'd get the penguin 350, doesn't quite have the capacity but more liveable.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This is the only food my chinchilla will eat! With other brands he will toss the bits away that he doesn't like, but this food is agreeable to him, and there is no waste from him tossing his food cup over!

"Received this cage in about 5 days. Opened it up and was dissapointed to find the base was cracked. Called the company on Monday and had my replacement base and wheels on Thursday. Great customer service.The cage is bigger than I expected and my 8 lb rabbit is able to stand up in all parts of the cage, which she loves. lots of botton room even with a medium little pan. The floor is made of 2 sections of hard plastic with small oval openings for ""stuff"" to fall through to pan. It took her 24 hours to acclimate to the ramps but she is all over the place and loves being up high when we pass the cage to get extra rubbies.The cage is in three parts in addition to the base. The lower half, upper half of metal cage and top. The cage was simple enough to assemble but did need a little strength to manipulate the cage halves to fasten together (2 clips). Once the cage was assembled, it is very sturdy and the wheels are very secure and go all directions.Love this cage - Worth the money",bunny rabbit central,1
"I don't have this assembled correctly; I can't get tighten the crossbars enough to hold them in place. I'll spend more time with the directions but in the meantime, I can rest the crossbars on top of the base of the shade which pulls over to hide items in the back of my Forester. It's working for my two small dogs. It may not work for large, strong, determined dogs but for mine I'm happier with this than I would have been to spend $200 to get the Subaru-brand dog barrier permanently installed. I like that this can be removed so that I can still transport cargo throughout the length of the car.",dogs,3
"This is an excellent tool. If you use it on the cat every week, it's unbelieveable how much hair you remove from the cat's uncoat. After doing this, the amount of hair left around the house is reduced dramatically. I would recommend this product for anyone who has an indoor cat. It works great on short & long hair cats.",cats,2
"after reading some of the reviews I hesitated to order this product... but I'm glad I did. It works great. When I got it I programmed it (not as bad as some people say) and waited for it to go off. It did, at exactly the time programmed. I even took the food out of the tray to measure it. It was exactly one cup like I had programmed. I read one review that said the food container did not fit on tight. They must have not noticed that you have to turn it. It's very secure and sturdy. My dog loves it. He gets up every morning and waits for it to go off. Very satisfied. Only downside is you have to reprogram it when you change batteries.",cats,2
"This is a great product that has kept my lab busy for hours! My german shepherd loves to chase it down and bring it back but my lab's sole desire is to destroy it which he hasn't been able to do yet so it is pretty durable. I wish the grooves were larger so I could get more peanut butter in it without buying their special can but it isn't a big deal. If I could find an &#34;Xtreme&#34; version, I would go for it just because those seem to last forever.Bottom line; I would recommend this to any dog owner.",dogs,3
Cat chills on this from time to time so i think she likes it and it seems to keep her warmer than just sitting on the floor.,cats,2
This is a good dog toy.My dog liked it and plays with it alot. My dog likes that it squeaks.,dogs,3
It's very thin. The pictures make it look more fluffy than it actually is. My bulldog doesn't complain so I guess dogs don't care too much However for the price I'd expect more fluff.,dogs,3
"I bought this bed for my 75lb. Amstaff mix. If he could talk he would say ""he doesn't like this bed very much."" The reason I was attracted to this style of bed is I thought it may diminish the doggy odor my dog would have after spending time sleeping on his mat pillow bed, especially during the warmer months. My thinking would be the elevation would allow for air circulation below as well as above him. This does seem to be the case as he is noticeably more pleasant smelling using this bed. However, the way this bed is constructed is that the curved steel rail/legs are inserted into each other with nothing to hold them in place other than friction. As a result, they periodically come apart collapsing the bed and dog to the floor. Needless to say my Amstaff does not appreciate being startled out of a deep snooze in this fashion. If I would place his mat pillow bed on one side of the room and this steel-framed bed on the other, directed my dog to got to his bed, 100 out of 100 times he would go to the mat pillow bed without hesitation. If this bed was constructed so as to allow it to somehow be able to fasten the legs than perhaps he would have appreciated it more. As for now, everything he does indicates ""not for me."" Recommended with reservations. Know thy dog.",cats,2
"The Bamboo brand Nail clippers are consistently sharp (no split nails, or pinched nerves due to a dull blade) and the nail cuts cleanly, without snapping and pinching that dull blades cause. The ergonomically curved handle has a rubber insert that helps keep a good grip and prevent slipping. This is especially useful when dealing with squirmy dogs.The removable styptic tube/file and applicator is perfect for using just the right amount of styptic and the applicator is ergonomically designed to fit the shape of a dog's nail. No mess, no wastage. There is also a small metal nail file on the side of the applicator tube but the cut is usually so clean that there isn't really a use for it.For people who tend to get their hand pinched by scissor-style clippers, this style pinches the least. However, the Guilotine-style clippers may work better for you.The downside to this clipper is that the handle is made of plastic and that it doesnt last long for a grooming salon that handles lots of dogs. For a home user, this should last problem free.A few improvements for a home user would be the addition of a nail guard for really squirmy dogs and inexperienced owners. (A piece of metal that swings out to prevent cutting off too much nail at once)All Bamboo brand products come with a small illustrated 'How to' guide and this is no exception. Overall an excellent product for both home and limited salon use.Bamboo also sells replacement styptic applicator tubes/refills that fit into the handles pefectly.",dogs,3
"I like this container a lot. The 20lb kibble keeper holds the contents of my cat's 20lb food bag, plus a little more. The lid is easy to use and snaps on, which is nice since my cat likes to try to get into the extra food. It looks nice in the room. It is tall instead of round, so it doesn't seem to take up as much space as other containers.",cats,2
My puppy loves the bully sticks but with this item she became very aggressive when we tried to take it away. Let her have it again with the same behavior.....it went to the trash.,dogs,3
I purchased this item a year ago and it is great. I have two small dogs and I like the fact that this keeps them from falling onto the floor or coming into the front seat area. I do agree with other reviews that comment about it not getting very clean after washing. I have not experienced the bad smell. I have noticed that the metal clasps over time rub on the headreast and seat area leaving marks. I have leather seats and I started noticing black marks on the area of the seats where these clasps are. I have been looking for some type of substitute clasp or strap but have been unsuccessful. I have found another quilted hammock that uses nylon velcro straps instead. Haven't purchased it for fear the velcro might not be strong enough to handle the weight of a dog.,dogs,3
I love the smell of this stuff and use the shampoo and conditioner on my Afghan Hound. However the smell of the cologne just doesn't seem to last very long. I'm not sure if it even lasts a whole day. will continue to use it though and I'm going to keep track of how long it does last.,cats,2
"We have a German Shepherd who learned the bad habit of running away and chasing cars long before we got him. I hated the idea of an electric collar until the day he chased a semi-truck down the road. Thankfully he couldn't catch it, but it made me realize that all the treats were not helping him learn to stay home. We had this set on the highest setting for a week, (after the initial traing)since then it is set on the tone only, and he hasn't left the yard at all. I reccomend this system to anyone with a stubborn dog. The first shock is pitiful, but our dog hasn't had a problem since. Every time he forgets about his boundrys the warning beep sends him well back in his area.",dogs,3

"I have been giving Free & Clear to my Maltese for the past year. My vet recommended it after he found oxalate crystals and her urine. We tried various things to combat the crystal formation over a period of 4 months and nothing worked. In fact, when trying to change her ph from acidic to alkaline in order to avoid the crystals, she developed struvite crystals. Then he told me that another patient of his, a golden retriever, uses free & clear and asked if I wanted to try it. After 2 weeks, she was completely clear of all crystals and hasn't had any in over a year. I also give it to my other 2 dogs, my malshi and my shih Tzu rescue who have a tendency to develop struvite crystals and it works on them as well. I highly recommend this product.",cats,2
Just got my hide and seek squirrel toy today--Both my Cavalier King Charles Spaniels love it...they fight over it but theres enough squirrels to go around. Both dogs were able to get the squirrels out of the tree trunk..infact they seem to love carrying the tree trunk around too.

"We had a problem with our cats clawing the furniture, so we tried to get them to use a scratching post instead. We bought a few different ones from the pet store and none of them really seemed to work. So we finally bit the bullet and bought this one despite the comparatively hefty price tag.Boy are we glad we got it! The cats love it and use it all the time. The best part is that they have stopped clawing the furniture. We just put it next to the couch they were always clawing and like magic they started using the post instead!Great product. Well worth the price.",cats,2
"All of my dogs have come from shelters, all have been girls, and all were potty-trained before I adopted them. But my first boy dog, a Shih Tzu puppy we named Chewie, was the exception. I tried every thing I could possibly think of and read every bit of advice onlinen, but I am a lousy teacher and could not help Chewie learn the concept. The wee wee pads solved everything.I place them in an inconspicuous area of the house, and he knew INSTANTLY what to do. The wee wee pads do not let odor permeate the air, and they absorb EXTREMELY WELL. I've tried other brands, and they do not measure up to the quality of ""Four Paws"" brand.I cannot even imagine how many animals wind up in our shelter system because they aren't properly taught to potty outside. I've no doubt that Wee Wee Pads has helped hundreds of sweet animals remain in loving happy households.You would be TERRIBLY remiss to purchase them ANYWHERE other then Amazon. Wee Wee Pads cost a FORTUNE at stores such as Petco, which is where I had been buying them. You get a MUCH better deal when you order them through Amazon.com. Not only do they have the Four Paws brand Wee Wee Pads, but they have them in boxes of 150-pack counts. I'm paying LESS and getting more product.Amazon",dogs,3
"This crate is fantastic. Its sturdy enough and VERY affordable compared to many other brands. No assembly required, you just need to pop it up and make sure the sides are connected. I had it set up in about 2 minutes. The pan slides out for easy cleaning. If you need an affordable crate, this is the one to get. I'm glad Amazon had it. Also, this size crate fits my female boxer perfectly, in case you need to figure out what size to get.",dogs,3
Wow if i knew how much cats would love this stuff i would have been feeding it to any and all of my cats long ago. You would think it was wet food the way my kitty chows it down.

"My pup loved it while it lasted, but I wish this was made of harder materiel. The squeaker was a little annoying but funny. This toy lasted about 2 hours and was torn apart, one of the balls was in 1/2. Careful to watch your dog as this could become a choking hazard",dogs,3
"Rafferty is my dog, we have been together for 14 years. Four years ago ,when he could barely walk, I was introduced to Artri-Soothe. I will never go without it again so long as Raffety and I are companions. It is a fabulous product. Thank you Arthri-Soothe and Amazon",cats,2
"We have used Frontline exclusively for years. A recent addition to our pack - a 4 year old Beagle rescue - kept getting fleas despite regular use of Frontline. Worse, she is apparently allergic to fleas, causing her to bite obsessively at her lower back and tail.At the suggestion of a vet we switched to Advantage and immediately saw results. Our daughter also switched for her cat, and noticed a similar improvement. The one negative is that Advantage does not work for ticks, so we will need to find an alternative treatment before Spring.",dogs,3

"I purchased the Lucky Dog 5 x 15 foot weatherguard Kennel Roof System less than a year ago from Atwoods and the tarp is disintegrating. It is shedding small silver flakes all over the place and has developed a large tear. This cover is in an open area that is not exposed to falling limbs or excessive pine straw, just a lot of hot Arkansas sun. I am very disappointed in this tarp because I have car covers, boat covers, motorcycle covers, propane grill covers, etc. that are several years old and they are holding up fine. This tarp didn't even last a year. I like the kennel, it wasn't to difficult to put together and it gives you the option of 5 x 15 feet or 10 x 10 feet. But I do not recommend this cover. You can purchase a much cheaper tarp that will hold up for several years.",dogs,3
"I have a smallish condo so only have 1 litter box for my 2 male cats -- and walking in to the condo you would never know I have cats. I scoop at least 2 times a day. The ScoopWell Premium Litter scoop does a fantastic job! I have had it now for 10 months and I have had absolutely no problems whatsoever. Since it does a great job of getting everything, I don't use (waste) as much litter. Even when removing litter that has gotten stuck to the bottom of the litter box, I have had no problems with this scoop. (I also ""choke up"" on the handle to avoid the possibility of it breaking per Phillip's review.) Hoping to get one for a family member if they are still available!",cats,2
We use this pet barrier to keep our dogs in the back section of our 2011 Outback. Was very easy to install and doesn't cause any permanent damage to the car. Can see out of it while driving and the dogs are not able to jump over the back seat onto our daughter. My in-laws borrowed it for their Highlander and it also fit and worked great. This is an excellent solution for a mid-size to large SUV needing to keep dogs in the back area during car rides.,dogs,3

"Premier Twist and Treat / B0002I0RLWThis is a nice little treat dispensing toy, but it's a bit tricky for humans to handle. The toy is shaped like a child's spinning top, with two halves (top and bottom) that unscrew from each other. You unscrew the top half, and try to balance the bottom half with one hand while you pour doggy kibble and tiny, cut-up treats into the bottom half. Once the bottom half is full, you use your ""food pouring hand"" to screw the top half back on. It's a bit of a balancing act, and I prefer theOmega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, because the Omega ball is much easier to fill. Maybe two parent families will have an easier time with the Premier.As for doggie enjoyment, my puppy likes the Premier Twist and Treat well enough, mostly because he's discovered that one really hard bat of the paw will cause the toy to spin on its axis and pretty much expel all the food right away. (My puppy is currently 4 months old, and 12 pounds.) Once again, for a better time-to-treat ratio, I recommend the Omega ball.Still, the puppy likes both the Premier and Omega and I like giving him a variety of toys, so this gets 4 stars from me. I have not had any troubles with toy durability, but I'm also blessed with a puppy that doesn't chew very much (yet!). I *highly* recommend filling this toy primarily with the dog's usual kibble, with a few treats interspaced in the mix as ""surprises"". There's really no need to stuff it full of treats - the puppy enjoys the toy just as much, and it makes ""dinner time"" a more interactive and exercising experience! I chop my doggie treats up very finely for training purposes and my puppy is always eager for the taste of a treat without filling up or getting sluggish or fat.~ Ana Mardoll",dogs,3
"i bought this, thinking that i might get a little bit of use out of it...but i had no idea how happy this would make my 15 year old cat! we had just moved across the country into a new home where she would no longer be able to be indoor/outdoor...plus she had just recently lost her hearing...now we have to go outside every day when i come home from work...i take the laptop with me and watch a movie or read while she just lays down and sleeps! i've been leaving the tent outside set up, since we haven't had much rain...came out one morning to discover a bird hanging out inside it! he was drinking out of the water bowl i had left in there!i'm so happy with this product...i thought i was going to have to leash train her or build some sort of cat pen...it's very easy to fold up, once you get the general idea and seems to be holding up pretty well...although she doesn't scratch at the mesh...the only time the tent gets a little beat up is when one of the feral cats pokes his head through the fence opening...then she takes the entire tent with her when she lunges at the cat!",dogs,3

"The feeder itself is an ok concept, but the control unit is awful. As an engineer/programmer, it is obvious to me that an idiot wrote the logic for the control unit. There are so many ways that will bring the unit into a bad state. There have been too many times when I come home, and all the contents of the feeder are completely on the outside of the unit. I had to clean up the mess and scoop it back into the container. Hopefully they have improved the control unit by now, but otherwise, I wouldn't waste $100 on this unit.And also, the container is not air tight, so I have had ants swarming inside the container and I had to throw out all the food to get rid of them.",cats,2
"One of my kittens started urinating right next to the litter box. I bought a bag of Dr. Elsey's cat attract and haven't have any pee outside the box in about 24 hours. I set out 3 differnt litters the other day, and the kittens ignore all the other boxes. I've never used a clumping litter before (was using a non clumping litter and then feline pine), and I must say this litter has great odor control and is so easy to clean. The kittens have been tracking it all over my apartment though....YOu can get a 20 lb bag of Dr. Elsey's cat attract for about $13 at PetsMart. You can get a 40lb bag of Dr. Elsey's blue multi cat litter for about $15. I think I will start mixing the two litters to save on cost.

I normally brush my dog once or twice a day as he has two acres to frolic in and gather weeds all over himself; he does have a good time at it.The brushing is usually done outside or in a room without a carpeted floor just for the above stated reasons.",cats,2
"I purchased both the bee-hive and squirrel ""hide a ..."" toys for my Westie. Even at three months old he was able to figure out quickly how they ""work"", and just loves them! The Bee-hive is definitely more difficult than the squirrel one (due to the size of the bees v size of holes). But it was nice to have it for him to grow into, so to speak. They do tend to smell pretty strongly at first, but if you do as the manufacturer suggests, and take them out of the box and throw them in with your laundry basket for a day or so, the smell will significantly lessen, and your dog will also be much more attracted to the toy, as it will smell like ""mom"" or ""dad"".Also, the bees and bee-hive make for great toys individually as well. My (now four month old) Westie just learned to play fetch- mainly to teach ""drop it""- a crucial command to learn- and he loves playing fetch with the bees. He has even learned already their names (""bring mommy a bee""; ""find the squirrel"", etc)He has also totally fallen in love with the bee-hive itself! He's starting teething, and even though it's plush, he loves to dig his face into one of the holes and chew softly, almost like it's his pacifier or something! and it doubles as a pillow (as he likes to do that at night when he's getting sleepy).And as far as ""entertainment value"" these hide-a-bee, (etc.) toys are absolutely number one! There is nothing funnier then when he grabs it in his mouth and shakes it like crazy, to make sure it's ""dead"" (maybe??). And the very best... when he gets his head stuck inside the bee-hive, and will thrash his head around, and run into walls, etc. Now, don't get me wrong- I try and help him get his head out, but he looks at me through the other holes, smiling away, and won't let me take it off- he has as much fun doing that as I have watching it!A MUST HAVE...

"I am a pet sitter and just wanted to remind people that if this ball has only one hole in it, a dog biting down on it can create a vacuum and the dog's tongue can get sucked in and the dog will not be able to pull the ball off. I have seen a heartbreaking case of a large dog that's tongue got sucked into the ball and before anyone noticed, the tissue had died and the dog's tongue had to be amputated. Please be sure this ball has at least two openings in the boy before giving it to your pet. Make sure there is no vacuum created if the one hole is stopped up. Save you pet from permanent damage.",dogs,3
"This is a great product with only one flaw. Sometimes it's difficult to find the edge of the plastic bag to pull it through and get the roll started. It would be great if the manufacturer could simply put a piece of colored tape onto the edge that the consumer could pull on to get the roll started properly. A couple of times I have had to pull out just about the entire roll in my attempt to find the edge to get it started. I would then have to stuff all of the plastic bag back into the container, which really hurt my fingers. If there were a colored tab to pull on to get it started, that would be perfect.UPDATE 06/20/09I have stopped buying this product because the price just keeps going up and up. I now use plastic grocery bags each day to scoop the waste into, tie the handles shut at the top, then toss the bag into my outside garbage container. The grocery bags are free, and they work just fine. I also had a problem with the litter locker itself the last few months that I used it -- it would not stay closed when I picked it up, so it would make a nasty mess when it fell open in the middle of my room. I don't know if the litter locker just wore out or not; I just knew I was not happy with its performance or the insane cost of the refills for it. I'm much happier with the free shopping bags system I'm using now.",cats,2
I've tried several types of glucosamine for my dogs and I've found that this one works best for us.

"I absolutely love this filter. I set it up in my fifty five gallon fish tank three weeks ago, and have not had any problems at all. The water did not become cloudy or discolored a few days to a week after setup, as newly set up tanks usually do while the beneficial bacteria grow and the tank orients itself. I have a seven inch (and still growing!) common goldfish in the tank as well as a four inch comet goldfish. It is reccomended that goldfish tanks have twice the filtration needed for the size of the aquarium, and this filter is just that. Set up was quick and incredibly easy, and I believe replacements and cleaning of the pieces will be a piece of cake! I have read some other reviews complaining about the filter being noisy, and I have to disagree. Any power filter will make some degree of sound, but the sound is more of the water flowing into the tank rather than a mechanical sound. This filter is wonderful and meets all expectations- highly reccommended!",fish aquatic pets,4

Love this little bowl system - the bowls actually fit snugly and don't rattle around like the previous metal holder I purchased. I am so happy with the lack of noise and think my dog is as well. I have a small dog (about 12 pounds) and this size is perfect for him. It's SS so easy to clean and just all around good size to have in the kitchen without getting in the way. The only issue I have is the reversible sides don't stay up but that is a minor thing - I'll probably glue them in place. I have SS appliances with black quartz counters and it fits in well with my colors as a bonus. I would recommend to anyone with a small dog.,cats,2

"I've purchased A LOT of aquarium kits in the past year. Here on amazon alone I have been through three different ones. I've also purchased two from eBay. By far, hands down, this was the best investment I made. It's an acrylic, plexi-glass aquarium. This means it was light-weight, durable, and held up during transit (which was not always the case with my other kits).The lighting of this aquarium is perfect. The lights are small and not overly bright as to blind the fish. They give the aquarium a subtle glow that isn't overpowering. I really love the look of it.I purchased the 12 gallon aquarium. It's quite large and holds up well. On the bottom there are 'bumps' that help the aquarium have traction to the table but also give you room to slip your fingers underneith if you need to move it.The filter is silent. As long as your aquarium is full, it won't make any noise at all. Sometimes you'll hear a very low humming but it blends in with the rest of the noise of the house and literally goes unnoticed. The filter cartridges are affordable. I personally clean mine out with hot water once a week and they last for about two months. The entire filter itself needs to be cleaned about twice a year. This takes about ten minutes and is really easy to do.The aquarium was easy to set up, the directions are self-explanitory. For a beginner aquarium owner they may be a little complicated, but take your time and read through them carefully. It really explains each part. There's only about six peices total that actually need 'assembled'. For a first-time aquarium owner it would probably take 30 minutes to set up. For people like me who have owned aquariums prior, it takes around 5 minutes.I keep blackfish. If you have tropicals, salt-water, or fresh water fish (aside from Betta and Goldfish) you will probably want to invest in a air pump, heater, and thermometer. Other than that it comes with everything you need. Including a bio-wheel that helps create a balance of good algae in the water.I ordered this directly from 'The Fish Place'. It came packaged, well-wrapped in bubble-wrap, and in a box that fit it perfectly. I was surprised how big it was. Much bigger than expected- but that was a good thing.All in all- perfect aquarium. Great investment for beginners and experienced fish owners alike. 5 out of 5 stars- coming from a girl who has owned A LOT of aquariums.",fish aquatic pets,4

It took about a minute to install it (miraculously all the straps were already set to fit my vehicle) and putting the straps under the seat and the bungee cord with hook was very easy. My only disappointment is this cover just comes in one color, sort of a green color with brown trim, and my seats are gray. Since I have dark tinted windows you can't even tell it. I would have liked a gray cover but I was so amazed at how good this one fit the backseat that I can look past it. Also, the seat belt openings are perfect for this vehicle.

After installation, I noticed there was a fairly powerful current in my tank, which my lazy betta fish did not appreciate.There is an adjustment knob on the side of the filter, which, when set to the minimum, was still a little too powerful for my tank. To fix this, I took a piece of filter material I had lying around from my other tank, and wrapped it around the exit nozzle. This helped slow the exiting water and reduced the current.Though this filter is advertised for tanks up to 3 gallons, I would not recommend it for anything smaller than 1.5-2 gallons.",fish aquatic pets,4

"For our two cats we have a Platinum Drinkwell Fountain. We also live in a VERY hard water area.. There is nothing about the fountain or the filters that will ""soften"" the water, that is not what they're for. The idea is to get cats--descended from North African Desert animals---to drink more water. Its better for their kidneys; they'll likely live longer. ( A high percentage of older cats die from kidney failure, it is very common. Many veterenarians now are encouraging the use of some canned or ""wet"" cat food in a cat's diet to provide more moisture, since most cats aren't big on drinking....thats in part what all this is about.)As other posters have commented, my former cats always wanted the tap water on a ""thin"" drip or flow of water. It had to be ""just so""...not too much, not too little...but they preferred drinking that water over their water in bowls, no matter how often the bowls were changed/cleaned. (Yes, I tried glass, ceramic, stainless steel, every recommendation about what type of bowls cats are said to prefer...)When the cat water fountains first came out I was skeptical at first...but it made sense, obviously this re-created what the cats preferred. The running water, the sound....so I got one.The critical element after buying the fountain is maintaining it. READ the directions! Change the filters ""every 2-4 weeks depending on the size and number of pets using the fountain"". Thats from the back of the Drinkwell filter package. And please use Drinkwell filters if you have a Drinkwell fountain! They are made to work together.Also, read the directions as far as maintaining the Drinkwell (or any brand) of water fountain. It has a motor! Therefore, it must be maintained or will not work right. Maintaining it means keeping it clean from the residue of hard water chemicals, the animal's food (which can drop into the water after they eat, then go round the circle of the water cycle...) and so on.CLEAN the fountain...including the little parts around the motor. We take it apart about every other week and put the entire fountain, minus motor, in the upper section of the dishwasher, and run it, with the usual dishwashing detergent, which works great. The motor area can be cleaned with q-tips or the special brushes sold by Drinkwell. If the fountain is not kept clean and the fiilters are not replaced, the whole thing will stop working, though long before that your cats will be drinking recycled dirty water.This isn't hard, just a bit of reminding yourself, or marking on a calendar. Just like with your car, there is basic cleaning and maintenance required.From reading some other posters",cats,2

"Very well made, love the fabric and design but the sizing is all wrong. I contacted the company before buying with my dog's measurements and they said to go with the girth size. Well the girth size is ok but the coat is way too short - makes her look like she's wearing a monkey suit! And the size that is larger is only 2 inches longer which won't really make all that difference. My dog is a mutt, she's a normal shaped dog, neither elongated nor stout. Needless to say I'm quite disappointed, I was so looking forward to keeping her warm and snug with this coat.",dogs,3

"My cat, Jasmine, is a shelter adopted cat and had been abused. Therefore she is very upset when anyone comes to my home. She is frightened about every little noise. It took her about four months for her to get comfortable with me. Sooooo! When it came Christmas time and I was to spend a few days at my daughter's house, I had a problem. I defintely couldn't leave her home, but was concerned how Jasmine would react. I bought the Waterer and the Feeder together. We put Jasmine in the bedroom I'd be using, along with her litter box. She was comfortable enough to have me and my family &#34;visit&#34; her through the day to comfort her. At night she had me to herself just like at home. So it made for a great experience for her, instead of a frightening one. Sooooo, thanks to this waterer and feeder systems it was a great holiday season. The seller was really good and the items arrived on time and in great condition. I will use Amazon the this seller again.",cats,2
"We have a Great Pyrenees whom we bathe at home. Drying time with 2 hair driers took too long, so I bought this Air Force Commander 4hp dryer to get the job done. Its 2-speeds and heater air stream sounded like the solution to drying our dog in a fraction of the time. The unit itself is so LOUD that it was very annoying to us and absolutely alarming to our Pyr. She was so panicked by the sound, that she kept trying to escape the bathroom where we were drying her. Even with the blower unit placed in the adjoining WC, and the air hose fed into the main bathroom, it was still very loud and not pleasant. Other room setups might remedy the noise problem, so when the weather gets warmer, we may try it outside.The unit appears very sturdy and well made. The hose is made of thick material so it seems like it will last. The air flow is strong, even at the lower of the two settings. The higher setting seems to provide more warm air, without the air temp ever seeming too hot. The Air Force unit comes with a number of hose attachments which allow the user to customize the flow of air. This is a nice feature.The air flow produced by the Air Force Commander 2 4hp is strong - leaf blower strong. I'm going to use the Air Force unit to blow out the garage this afternoon. I've also read reviews of people who have purchased this unit to dry their car right after washing, as it blows out all of the water caught in the seams of the body and makes drying your car with a towel nearly unnecessary.If you're a car cleaning fanatic who details their classic collectables - buy this unit. If you're a pet owner who washes their pet at home, buy the smaller, less powerful unit. The 4hp Air Force produces hurricane-strength wind that may be too much for medium and small dogs. I defiantly recommend the Air Force Commander 2 dryer, especially for its versatility.",cats,2

"We have a lab who is a champion chewer so it's tricky to find toys that don't wind-up in 5 million little spit wads and then as psychedelic poop within minutes of opening the package, but this toy rocks!!!! First, it's an awesome ball for playing catch and because it's a soft, but SUPER durable rubber, if it hits anything, it won't break or ding it. We went through so many tennis balls, and our dog would skin them like an animal before proceeding to tear it up, but she loves playing ball, so this fit the bill perfectly. Second, you can tuck treats into it and keep your dog engaged for quite some time. Third, it lasts!! We had one for nearly three years (got lost on a backpacking trip) and it stood up to the most rough-house play imaginable.",dogs,3

Plus you can flush it, rather than having to put the pet waste in a bag and then take it out to the garbage can. With clay litter, you get a big cloud of dust every time you add more litter, but not with this product. It is expensive, but as long as we scoop it frequently, the 34 pound bag will last nearly a month for four cats. My cats love World's Best Litter and so do I!",cats,2

Working my way through putting them on all the dogs. I just wish they sold harnesses with an O-ring at the chest and sturdy strap on the back and not the step-in kind, which are useless for control or training with methods that use a harness.

"After reading the rave reviews I was definitely sold but I thought the price was way too high. With the 60 day money back guarantee I decided to go ahead and get it especially with the lack of any competing brand that had disent reviews. Now (one month later) we don't regret it at all as everything works as advertised and with four (yes four=4) adult cats we clean the waste drawer once every 5 to 7 days and we are still odor free. Having several cats with no odor and no scooping the litter sounded too good to be true, but this machine made it TRUE. You still have to use a good clumping litter brand and pay around $350 with tax for it but if it keeps working the way it is working now for at least 3 years then we probably will get our money's worth.",cats,2

"I bought this having read the positive and negative reviews. After having used this for a month or so, I have to agree with the negative reviews. This gate is poorly designed. The pads that hold the gate in place do not pivot and my car's roof is not flat, so there is a gap between the gate's pad and the ceiling. This causes the gate to fall over, especially if the dog has been lying against the bottom of the gate. Also, installing the gate was a pain - not because it was difficult but because the screws holding the crossbars in place were difficult to access. Overall, I don't rate this very highly and I wish I'd paid more attention to my gut when it said not to go with this. Very disappointed.",dogs,3
After receiving 2 collars (I have 2 barkers) one worked and the other didn't - so we changed the batteries. It still does not work (yes we filled them). The working one worked for a little while and now is very tempermental and our dog has figured out how to bark at a certain octave and not set it off - where other times it is going off constantly. I thought these would be a good solution - but it turned out to be a waste of money.,dogs,3
"I had high hopes for this product as it had so many good reviews. However, I have a half full-sized Poodle, half Australian Shepherd dog - he has very thick fur, basically looks like a giant teddy bear. He is very athletic, we've run every distance race from the mile to the marathon, most on trails, and he loves to play fetch in any weather - so gets pretty dirty. The Spotless Paw just can't even handle it and is covered with dirt after one leg, which is still dirty. I thought I would give it another try when I moved to Seattle - but it still didn't cut it.I suppose if you have a dog with short fur, it would be OK, but even when his fur is shaved short, it doesn't seem to do the job. I just put him in the bathtub and use a handheld attachment to spray off the dirt. I am going to try to use it to dry him off AFTER the shower, perhaps it works pretty well for this - so I gave it two stars instead of just one, because perhaps in that case it will save me from using a full sized towel, if it absorbs the water from that.",dogs,3

"I had my doubts. I have tried many brushes and gadgets on my lab and finally decided to bite the bullet and buy the Furminator.....and I am DAMNED impressed! We were amazed at the amount of undercoat we were able to get off of him just the first time we used it. His coat is sleeker, shinier and he definitely seems more comfortable. I have recommended it to friends and even though the price is a bit high, it was well worth it. It's heavy, got a great grip, has a handy hanging tab on top and a plastic guard for storage. You won't be sorry. This is a must have if you have a shedding problem...and who doesn't??",cats,2

"I bought this because my older dog was getting sick and having lots of accidents around the house. The product definitely works - but in order to get it to work, you have to use a large amount of it on the stains.In the first day, I went around my carpet using it on all of the spots and low and behold, now weeks later, the spots have disappeared. I also used it on a spot that had been on the carpet when we moved in. Maybe someone had spilled something or had a pet have an accident there before, but the spot is completely gone now.It's a shame it's so expensive- the bottle is completely gone now (along with the stains) but I'll have to wait to buy new.Keep in mind, it took *weeks* for the stains to completely go away - but only one application. Additionally, it does smell - pretty strong - so I would wait for a day where you can pour it on and open the windows.",dogs,3

"The only redeeming thing about this, and the only reason I bought it, was for the Microban feature. Microban is very handy. Among other trade secret ingredients, it's thought to contain particles of the antiseptic Triclosan embedded in the plastic during molding. Triclosan is a common anti-microbial agent found in hand soaps, toothpaste and other antibacterial products. If you forget or don't want to regularly clean your pet's food bowl, Microban is a good thing, as it pretty much kills any bacteria/mold/fungi that form on the surface. However, that's where this product's appeal ends.The first thing I noticed about this item is, it's just bad quality. All the parts fit together with cheap plastic tabs, which are so loose, the weight of food makes it fall apart. So, if you pick up the feeder by the food storage unit, it will pop off, dumping food all over the place. Pick it up by the base top, and that will pop off the base's bottom, again spilling food. The pets may love this, but it's incredibly annoying for the humans.The ability to disassemble the base into two parts makes no sense as this thing is impregnated with Microban. Plus, that area is not accessible to pets, so there should be little need to clean in there. So, it only serves as another point of failure.To ensure I didn't just get a bad unit, I looked at several others in a few different pet stores over the last two years. Most were shrink-wrapped, so the flimsiness was hidden, but there were a LOT of returns that were taped together. Which is a clear indication the problem is a design flaw.To avoid buying another bowl, I eventually welded the two parts of the base, and the base and storage bin together with plastic epoxy. This keeps it from falling apart every time I move it or pick it up. The downside is, it will no longer come apart for cleaning, but with the Microban, this is not an issue. Unless your pet pukes in it, or uses it as a litter box, the bowl rarely needs to be washed. If it does get dirty, you can always remove the lid and toss it in the dishwasher.The info card with my unit says not to worry about over-feeding, as cats tend to self-regulate their eating habits. This is not completely true. Cats fed at regular intervals generally eat all their portion because they know it'll be some time before they can eat again. Cats with unlimited food supplies, however, tend to become ""nibblers"". They eat a bite or two every few minutes, all day and night. In a multi-cat household this can lead to increased fights over food bowl access. This nibbling also makes them more prone to overeating and, consequently, weight gain.My two cats, as well as the cats of four friends with similar products have all noticed their pets gaining weight as a result of using this feeding method. To be fair, this isn't this product's fault, rather, it's a result of the unlimited food method itself.Another problem is, despite the lid on the food reservoir, this device still exposes food to the air. How long it is exposed depends on how fast your cat(s) eat, and how frequently you fill it. In a two-cat household, I refill the unit around every two weeks. That's two weeks for the food to remain open to the air. Though Microban prevents spoilage, the freshness, flavor, nutrients and potency must be compromised. The cats don't seem to mind, but I do. Other manufacturers have a simple solution",cats,2
This is a nice alternative to the traditional pincher collar especially if you have one of the breeds that people tend to be afraid of. This looks less intimidating than other choker collars particularly the pincher collar. It is much easier to put on and take off than I expected. The only draw back at this point is that it is not quite as effective as the metal pincher collars with my Pittie. Rudy is still young so when I am just walking him in our neighborhood where people know him I use the traditional pincher collar but in public this is great because he still gets the reminder he needs to stay close and not pull. I feel sure that as he gets older and better behaved this will be the only collar I will need for walks. Since we haven't had it to long I am holding out on the durability issue but for now I am VERY pleased with this product.,dogs,3

"After losing an 11 month old kitten to FIP, I vowed to change my approach to nutrition and litter box habits, both of which play a role in Corona Virus reinfection (Corona being the virus that can mutate to FIP). I researched many litter systems (Cat Genie, liter Kwitter, LitterMaid, etc)....I even started designing my own! I finally settled on the Richell after stumbling upon it online. I figured it would at least give me an idea about how my cats would transition to another system.My present kittens (10 months old now) were both exposed to the same Corona that mutated into FIP in my last kitten as well as in several other kittens earlier in the year, so I am extra careful with them and was actively seeking a litter alternative. I finally came across this product after considering (and rejecting) the idea of potty training them as a way of reducing their exposure to feces and litter. I was surprised by how small it was when I pulled it out of the box, but pleased with how well made it was. I figured I'd see what their immediate reaction was to it, so I filled it with litter, closed the lid and placed Maggie on it. Her response",cats,2

"I got me kitty from an ex-roommate and with her came a lot of fancy toys and things, one of the being the panic mouse. Honestly, my cat doesn't seem to like it. When I first moved it, she played with it, as my roommate would leave it running sometimes when she was out, as long as the dog wasn't home. Then when I adopted the cat I was spending interactive playtimes with her (something she didn't really get as a small kitten) and now if I put the panic mouse on, she basically ignores it. She'll play with it some, but for the most part she's just not interested in it. I think she prefers the one-on-one time with me when I'm playing with her, even though the panic mouse does the same intereactions. I think cats like to feel loved, and while the mouse does the same action, its not the same as getting some hands on love an attention. I've also noticed that the fancy priced toys are often beat out by the simple piece of ribbon tied to a coat hanger, or an empty cardboard box. A lot of people like to feel good about getting thier pets ""the bast toys"" but when it comes down to it, the cat is most happy to simple spend time with you, even if you are just playing with a sock.(and for those who are wondering, I think the long piece of yellow plastic (thats kinda like a giant popcicle stick) is meant to help stabalize the base, at least thats how mine was set up when I got it. Its attached to the bottom with a couple little yellow-capped screws).",cats,2

"We bought this for our 7 month old Newfoundland who likes to roam into the neighbors yards. We have about 1 1/4 acres but he seemed to like the neighbors areas better than ours.Installation wasn't the easiest but we knew that going in since we were going to lay about 800' of wire. We did it all by hand utilizing a flat shovel to open a slot in the ground for the wire. Wire is buried 2-4 inches. Took about 12 hrs. for this part. Final connection to the transmitter was a breeze. All toll we had it up and running in 1 weekend.We started out setting the collar to the lowest level, wanting to see if our 100# baby could feel it at all. Trust me he did. When we took him out the first time with the collar on he wanted to see what the new flags were in the yard. These are the flags you install where the wire is so the dogs get a sense of where they can and can't go. After that initial shock, he won't go within 6' of the flags. He's a quick learner. We have had it installed for 3 weeks now and while we are outside with him there is no problem with him staying in his own yard.I've set the collar up to the medium level and actually tried holding the contacts and walking through the wire myself. While not painful, the shock is substantial.

Our trainer recommended that we use a treat ball as a way to challenge our puppy and focus his energy on something ""productive"" (for him, at least). This does the trick better than any other similar product. It is very durable yet (unlike a Buster Cube) soft enough that nothing gets damaged as it rolls into walls, chairs and the like. We use it for half of his kibble at each meal. After about 4 weeks of daily use, our ball is starting to show signs of wear but we have gotten far more use out of this than any other ""toy"" we've purchased.Our puppy is a high energy, very food motivated, tough-chewing, smart little guy who can get treats out of his Kong and open the child gate in under 5 minutes. But while this treat ball requires patience, our normally ""A.D.D."" puppy will persistently push this ball around the kitchen until he gets every last piece of kibble out. That can take 20-30 minutes. The ball does not make a good ""chew toy"" for a tough chewer (like our dog, who can chew off the top of a red Kong), however. We make sure to take it away after he empties it. Otherwise, it would never have lasted this long.",dogs,3

I bought this crate to use for my Maltese-poodle puppy. It is very durable and well-built. The seatbelt slot on the top is convenient for car rides and the overall crate is easy to take apart to clean. I recommend this product to anyone that is crate-training or transporting their dog.,dogs,3
"My Standard Poodle could only have tennis balls for brief periods and then I'd have to pick up the ball, because he would chew off pieces that I certainly did not want him to swallow. I saw that the company rated this ball a 5 out of 5 on toughness for chewing and bought one. He loved it, and it held up. So I bought him 4 more. So far no damage to any of them, and they have been greatly loved.I do have to keep hunting them up, because they wind up in the strangest places! But that's just because he so loves to play with them. Dogs can learn to chew things up that they haven't destroyed before, so I will be ever vigilant. But so far, I am thrilled with this toy.I also have a thing I do with tennis balls where I put a piece of braided nylon rope through it (involves a bent coat hanger and a utility knife), for a training toy. Looking at this ball, I see two holes and a hollow ball, meaning it is not too heavy for a dog to catch in his mouth, and I can put the rope through, tie knots to hold it, and voila!!!I really like this toy! THANK YOU, Planet Dog, for coming out with it!",dogs,3
"This doesn't work at all for my dogs. I don't know if it's not making any noise at all, or if they just ignore it completely.

"My vet has these for sale individually and recommends them to control tartar on our dog's teeth. The mildly abrasive action while he happily gnaws away is especially helpful to his back teeth.

"I go to speciality pet food stores to buy high quality dog food for my buddies. I've spent a lot of time reading bag sizes and labels that the biggest bag for the majority, if not all, the higher quality dog foods are up to 30 pounds in weight. Which also means under 30 pounds. The fresh batch of dog food I bought was about 28 pounds, and it filled the Vittle Vault with plenty of room still. I wanted to keep dog food as fresh as possible, and this was a solution to that. VS leaving the dog food bag with some exposer to air and whatnot insects that happen to cawl in even after rolling up the bag end.I have a german shepherd and a chihuahua, but my shepherd stays with me two months at a time. A big bag of dog food with him and the little dogll last about a month with leftovers before I have to buy another bag. So when my big dog leaves to stay at the &#34;other home&#34; for a couple of months, whatever food is left in the container can stay fresh since my little dog eats so little that it takes forever to finish food.",dogs,3

"As noted by other reviewers this door will not keep out raccoons. It does keep out other cats. In use for ten years I recently discovered the fault in the design as raccoons made it in and made a mess of the cat food. The door detects the field of a small magnet worn on the cat's collar and opens a latch that allows the door to be opened by the animal from the outside. The design is simple, durable and tolerant of the inevitable burden of cat hair. However the latch only prevents the door from swinging into the house. The door is free to swing outward. Raccoons, being prehensile, are able from the outside to lift the edge of the door outward, as there is no restraint in this direction, and gain entrance. After a couple of tries to make the latch lock the door from swinging in either direction I finally succeeded but the effort required modification to the door and to the locking tongue. It is surprising that the manufacturer has not as yet changed the design to provide this security in the intervening years since my purchase.Apparent, as well, from other reviews, it seems that the manufactured quality of this door has declined. To work as designed the door must swing freely without any obstruction. Otherwise it may not close properly and compromise its purpose. Magnets are installed to ensure that door is correctly positioned upon closure directly in line with the latch, but if anything is binding upon the hinges or the edges of the door this condition may not be obtained and the door will be left vulnerable to intruders. From reviewers' comments this circumstance of late appears to be a noted occurrence of the workings of mice and men.",cats,2

No need to test weekly, that is more a standard, and most likely written to have you use the product more (good sells plan:).",fish aquatic pets,4
"I bought this crate for my dog when I first got her. She's 4.5lbs and I bought the 22""L x 13""W x 16""H. It's a good size for her and very roomy.Pros:-- It comes with a divider so you can section off the crate for when you are crate training your dog.-- The double doors is nice because you can put it against a wall both ways.-- It's sturdy and durable and easy to set up.-- It has handles so you can carry it around easily.Cons:-- Be careful! The latch isn't as secure as I thought. My dog can open the crate from the inside. At first I thought it was a fluke and I didn't close it all the way but I found that she can open it by pawing at the latch. This is easily solved by turning the crate so the door against a wall.",dogs,3

"My dog adores this toy. She cries for it. It's a brain workout for her, and an exercise workout for me as I keep ""reloading"" the squirrels into the tree stump every 90 seconds--but it's worth all of the joy she gets from these! She carries a squirrel around the house with her sometimes, also like she's showing off. My only complaint was that within the first 5 minutes of her playing with it, a piece of fabric on the tree stump came loose and required a repair on my part (just seemed like the fabric in that area was sewn too close to the edge so she was able to pull it loose). It was no biggie, though, and has since been in mint condition despite how rough she is with it! I will be looking to order another one of these in the near future for my mom's dog. It peaked both my mom and her dog's interest when they saw my dog's, but her dog didn't want to touch it for fear of getting my dog's slobber ALL over her. So I'll be buying one soon so that she can have one--slobber free!",dogs,3

"I purchased this feeder for my humongous male St. Bernard and we both love it. It is easy to clean, just the right height, and stable enough for him to eat without the feeder toppling or moving.It was, however, a bit difficult to assemble. I had trouble pushing the legs into the slots. I tried the vaseline as suggested, but ended up removing two of the red stoppers on the legs. After that, they fit snugly without any difficulty. I did not fill the legs with water or sand as suggested. I decided to place the feeder on a braided rug and it is quite stable with the empty legs.You will have to clean it daily with a damp cloth or paper towel, but it is easier than cleaning caked on food off the floor below an open feeder. The closed bottom for the bowls is much more sanitary.Bottom line, it is well-priced, stable, sturdy, easy to clean, and Hoover, the dog, loves eating from it. He has completely stopped belching air and coughing up part of his food, so it is much healthier for him, too.I highly recommend this feeder for owners of giant breed dogs.",dogs,3

Coming home emtied handed was not an option for my cats!! I bought the kit and it is a no brainer. The grass comes up in a few days when put in sunlight. It takes about a week to get it up to the size for the cats to enjoy and it last about a week. It is worth it to see them devour the first blades when I put it out. My cats are two full grown 20lb kittys! They would live without out it but really like having it to munch on.

"My doxie is a major league, Hank Aaron barker. This product is 100% effective for him. He is a little shy (although stubborn sometimes), which might make a difference. He weighs 19 lbs. I really am not sure I could bear to shock him, as I am a bit tender-hearted towards him, but I probably would if that was what it took to stop heavy barking.There are a lot of nice extras about using this collar.-- It doesn't seem to cause him any pain, it just startles him.-- He seems to be comfortable with it, as large as it is (we keep it loose), and can run, jump, and sleep with it on.-- It allows him to bark at a very subdued volume, which I think is nice. It's a pleasant deep soft sound, not at all bothersome, and it lets him satisfy his bark urge to a degree. It also lets him communicate when he needs something.-- If he does bark, it keeps the mosquitoes away!!-- The spray does not smell bad at all -- it's almost pleasant-- It WORKS (for my doxie); after two or three single barks, he stopped completely.-- Strangely, he doesn't seem to object when I put it on him. He really lets you know if he doesn't like something, and he doesn't mind wearing this collar hardly at all.Here are the bad things:-- If you leave it turned on, the battery will run out.-- The collar itself is quite hard to size for a smaller dog; I had to use scissors and Scotch tape, which does not hold up well.-- It IS quite large on a small dog.We had him wear it for three weeks. Now, we just put it on him for a booster course if he barks twice in one day.You have to remember to turn it off when you take it off, and turn it on when you put it on your dog. This becomes automatic quickly. The citronella lasts a long time; at least, it lasts a long time if it works. Some dogs apparently are not impressed by the spray and bark the reservoir empty.There is a problem with recommending this collar, because it may or may not work for your dog. It is either the greatest thing since cut bread, or a total waste of money.My personal experience has been great with this product. It stopped a major behavioral problem immediately, without any pain inflicted on our dog. It's a bit expensive for a product that may not work at all in an individual case. The upside though is a big one, it is a FABULOUS product if your dog responds to it.",dogs,3
"We bought one of these almost three years ago and it has helped us tremendously. I confronted our neighbor about three years ago about his dogs barking, he told me if I had a problem with his dog barking to call the police, I did! He tried to have a restraining order put on us so we couldn't call the police, the judge quickly threw it out and told him to keep his dogs quiet, which he never did. So when he saw me putting this thing up he went balistic. The dogs kennel is about 7ft from my garage where I hung it. The barking is down to less than a quarter of what it used to be. I have had my best results putting it on the setting so the neighbors hear it also,apparently they don't like to hear it ! Too Bad, so sad! The dog gets used to it so every once in a while I unplug it for a day or so. When it is unplugged you definitely hear an increase in barking. Plug it back in and you definitely hear the difference. It has really helped us where the neighbor wouldn't do anything and the cops always showed up after it stopped barking !",dogs,3
"Im not sure exactly how this thing is supposed to rest on the dog's back. The instructions on the box are lousy, including the figures. The image of the dog on the box is a frontal view so you can't see how it rests on the back. When I put it on my dog I tighten the buckle down so that it rests on the middle of the dog's back. But when I brought my dog for obedience training to Petco, the trainer told me I had it on wrong. She said that I need to slip the buckle under the loop on the back of the dog's neck and then pull back. But even she wasn't sure! It seems to keep the dog from pulling either way but I wish I could be sure of the correct way.",dogs,3
"This automatic pet feeder worked well the first two days, and then our 7 week old lab puppy started chewing on it each day. After seven days we had to throw it out. The directions clearly state that it is not for puppies, but we did not read that before we ordered it. Luckily our puppy did not eat the dangerous metal rod hinge, the plastic LED cover or the D-size batteries. Part of the battery cover was eaten. Our puppy quickly figured out how to lift the LED cover and what buttons to chew to release all of the food. She ate well for a week. Highly recommend this feeder not be used for puppies that like to chew. Looks like it would work well for a cat or older dog, but we found it a pain to program and each time it is turned off, it needs to be reprogrammed.",cats,2

"We got a little feral kitten & wanted to keep her confined in the house at night ( allergies,) & sought out a combination that would work for us. We got a fairly large crate with a garage style door, this box, and a little pop-up square that was described as a play device (she thinks its a sleeping tent.) Kitty loves it all, as she feels safe, especially when the whole thing is covered at night. The litter box is easy to keep clean, important because I think cats prefer that; I do recommend giving it a good smack once it's turned over , as urine clumps want to stick. This keeps the dust and odors down, mostly, but keep a little dust pan handy ( I cut a piece of platic- cloth to keep in front of the door as well --to lift litter dust io and away easilr.). Oh, she originally wanted to sleep in there....& she finally figured it out, but loves to sit on top of it also, like it's raised patio. Get clumping litter. Finally, people may think it's odd to crate a cat, but she meows and complains until she gets the good night ritual, of treats, pets, discussions, and put away for the night!",cats,2

"After much online research and many mixed reviews on this product I was a on a mission to find the perfect covered litter box for four 8 week old kittens that I'm currently fostering. They had been using a basic open litter box. It was becoming much too time consuming always having to sweep the scattered litter around and in their crate. I wanted to find something compact to put inside their crate that is covered, and that didn't take up a lot of space. A lot of the covered litter boxes are on the larger side, because of the booda domes shape this is not. As far as keeping the litter contained, so far so good. I'd say there's significantly way less litter outside of the booda dome. Most importantly the kittens seem to love it too. However I have 3 adult cats that are on the larger side, and don't think I would purchase this item for them. I would however recommend this for kittens or a smaller cat.

So much hair, that sometimes I wonder whether it's gripping and pulling out loose hairs or if its also shearing off the undercoat with the semi-sharp edges between the tines of the comb. I could comb my cat forever, and the quantity of fur coming off of him never decreases. Also, I haven't really noticed less cat hair around the apartment. He never coughs up hairballs (as far as I know) so that's not really an issue for me either.My cat, as my title suggests, hates the comb, but will tolerate it as long as I follow the comb with a massaging hand. However, despite my reservations and my cat's distaste, I will be using the comb for the remainder of the foreseeable future.",cats,2

This product doesn't deserve any stars. I read the bad reviews for this product but thought I might get lucky so I purchased it anyway. That was a mistake. The product arrived in very unprofessional packaging. The product box was shipped loose in a used Cheez-It box. There was no additional packing material inside the box. When I open the product box it rattled from loose chips of plastic that had broken off the feeder. There was also a long crack in the plastic lid over one of the compartments. I inserted a battery to see if the feeder still worked but nothing for 2 days straight. The light in the feeder would flash but the feeder never actually released. The compartment lids don't appear to have any springs so I can't imagine this product would ever work even if it were not chipped.This product feels like a total scam to me. Do not buy this product. I've always had such good experiences with Amazon and because this product was listed on Amazon I expected the same quality. I will never look at Amazon in quite the same light again. I wonder why they even associate with such low quality vendors.,cats,2
"Algae fix, is a horrible fish murdering product. No one should sell this product - nightmare stories all over the internet and now a nightmare in my tank! My Fish are still very very sick days after using less than the recommended dose. I had to remove my guppies within minutes as the looked half dead, several hours later all my other fish became very ill. I performed a 50% water change and 30 hours later my fish are still twitching and won't eat. They almost appear to be blind. Oh my water is crystal clear but who cares about the water if the fish die! Google Algae Fix dead fish - this has happened to many users of this product!",fish aquatic pets,4
"Before I bought the Drinkwell I was using plain old water bottles with my cats. This fountain provides the convenience of a water bottle plus a functional filtration system that helps keep the water clean.My cats like it just fine although they were certainly curious about the sound it makes! (The pump is silent, however if you have the stream on a higher setting, it makes a small fountain-like sound).Part of the reason I purchased this is because someone gave me an Amazon gift card, however I would purchase it again even if I had no gift card.",cats,2

"For most of her sweet little puppyhood, my (now three-year old) Lab had what seemed to be a chronic case of that icky reddish-brown ear gunk and was very uncomfortable. We had to clean her ears several times a week and though she was very brave about it, I know it hurt. We had her on SD puppy kibble, so my vet suggested we go to Wellness sweet potato and whitefish. It has been amazing. Cleared it right within a couple of weeks and hasn't come back ever. We kept my old Lab (and this one too) off anything with yeast in it, which helped a little, but nothing like this. I wish I had known about this for my old girl. The cost might be a bit more than some of the others, but no cheaper than what we had been using, and no more medicine or vet bills. If it's about money, spend a bit more on prevention and save on vet bills. But it really isn't about the money, is it?And while you are treating your pup right, don't forget to make a pet disaster kit with food, water, treats, medications, toys, a crate, and most importantly, rabies and other vaccination paperwork. If you evacuate, take them with you. Sorry - just had to put in a plug for pet preparedness!",dogs,3
"I have just purchased the third Classic Cratewear cover. These are great for providing privacy for the dog while allowing air to circulate. They wash well, do not shrink, and are showing no signs of falling apart from being laundered. I love the fact that the crate pad is machine washable without having to remove a zippered cover. Just toss the pad in the machine and then into the dryer. No muss, no fuss. Obviously, since I now have three, I would buy this product again, and would highly recommend it.",dogs,3
"I made the mistake of trying to switch my dog (large breed boxer) to one of the currently trendy ""grain-free"" dogfoods... and he did not thrive at all. Loose stools, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, etc. 6 long months of misery for both of us before vet recommended this food. It solved all of his digestive problems; his weight is getting back to normal and his coat is shiny. He feels better too - lots of energy, doesn't have to potty as often, etc. Really happy I found a dogfood that is so gentle on his stomach.",dogs,3
"This is wonderful food. I feed my lab a raw meat diet but you could easily add cooked beef or chicken as well. It's easy to make up a batch for the day or to make/freeze in advance in case you'll be away or super-busy for awhile. My black lab Ally has been thriving on this food for over three years. She has no skin irritations, appears to be allergy-free and has never had any kind of digestive problem. And her coat is really lovely...soft and glossy. This way of feeding is so much better than kibble. Hope you give it a try.....",cats,2
"My Yorkie dog has had severely stained eyes since puppyhood, and she is only 3 years old now. I have tried many things to get rid of the tearing and stains. My dog has been to the vet, and to vet eye specialists to make sure she has no eye disease. Even though they detected no eye problem, they couldn't help with her tearing problem. Angel Eyes works great for my dog. During the first week of trying this product, my dog's eyes were improving! Her eyes look good now, with no tearing or brown staining. I will continue to use this product on my Yorkie.",dogs,3
"This is an amazing product. For years, I bagged the scoopable waste of my cats in grocery store plastic shopping bags. The problem with that is that the grocery store bags seem to ""breath"" and the odor escapes the bags if left in a trash can for one or more days.The solution to this problem...the Litter Locker and its refills! This container and its bags do not let even a hint of the odor escape. I recommend this product to anyone with cats. Your house will be odor free.",cats,2
"This is the third pet door I've bought and installed. The previous two were metal doors and they were rock solid. This is my first plastic door. I chose it because the price was right and because it's brown, it will blend better on the dark wood door. Also, since Amazon seems to have so many for sale - and with good reviews - I figured the plastic ones had to be good enough. Now, I'm not so sure.I can't even get the two door pieces to stay on and together. Metal screws into plastic - go figure - I guess someone thought this was an indestructible design. I disagree. It's barely hanging on. My cat would knock this off in an hour.So, I'm headed to Lowe's today to buy some new screws - and hopefully this will salvage the door installation experience.The instructions are just wrong - in a few places",cats,2
"Having become accustomed to seeing dog hair 'tumbleweeds' around our house for as long as we've had our two Welsh Pembroke Corgis, the Furminator has made me a believer in its magic. This thing effortlessly pulls the loose undercoat off in giant wads. After a few grooming sessions with it, the dogs looked great and stopped the noticeable shedding. Now, all we need is a quick touch-up every once in a while, much to the chagrin of Fozzy and Lily, who simply LOVE being groomed with it.Three words",cats,2
"What a wonderful product...This toy is a great one, for that special dog in your life...Fill it with Peanut Butter, or Kong's variety of treats.While this toy will keep your dog entertained for a bit, it still strongly advised assuming regular exercise and quality time with your pet. This toy simply serves as a mental challenge and short-term ""baby-sitter"" for your pet, and does not give them the proper exercise.It is very durable, but if you have a ""power-chewer"" it is recommended you purchase the Black kong toy, as it's a lot more stronger and durable. It's always a good idea to have more than one available for your pet. Simply, fill, freeze, and give to your pet. Wedge it in the fence, if your pet is in a cage and it presents a bigger challenge thus keeping them occupied and not barking.It is also recommended that you purchase the right size for your pet. I have a 8 month old GSD, and he currently used the large, however, I think he'd be a little happier with a size bigger for maximum treat capacity. Please check out Kong's size chart for an idea about what size you need... [...]Amazon is a great place to purchase these toys from, if buying more than just the one toy. I purchased the Classic Red, the Black, and the squirrel toy and am really happy I did.",dogs,3
"(48 X 30 X 33) Lab got bigger, needed a larger crate for him to be comfortable. He is still growing, so I thought I would get a large enough crate.

Got a great deal on this with fast shipping and a quality built product.",dogs,3
"Removes a lot more fur than the wire brush I was using - faster and easier. The cat enjoys it more, too. Most surprising, though, is how easy it is to clean. However, not all removed hair gets stuck in it so a decent bit will end up on your lap or shirt, but it leaves my cat silky smooth and has eliminated her shedding so I'm not complaining.",dogs,3
"I bought this toy for my yellow lab mix puppy (1 year old) and she LOVES it. I was concerned when it came and it was smaller then I was expecting, but it has held up very well. She did chew its ears off, but there are no holes in it. She loves the grunt noise that it makes and it is one of her favorite toys.",dogs,3
"The FURminator was a complete disappointment. Even for a short fur dog, the 4 inch edge is loaded with 3mm deep bristles that do not penetrate the fur deep enough or firmly enough so as to capture the loosened hair. I was surprised because I've read so many reviews and people have been raving about it.I compared it to a similar one at Petsmart that goes for +$40 and I've noticed that the bristles tend to be lined up in a v shape to each one - versus the one shipped to me where they are just straight and don't capture anything. So basically I bought a small metallic hair comb for a lot of money. I should have returned it but threw away the packaging.Don't waste your money on it. It's a rip off",cats,2
Bought this item for use in a cross country trip with our dog. Worked exactly as advertised. Didn't spill a drop of water. Our dog found it easy to drink from even with her big muzzle.

Very helpful if you have a pet who is dark-colored and loves to wander at night.",dogs,3
"I have a 2011 Honda Accord with leather seats and this seat cover works beautifully. I have a border collie/pug mix that weights 45lbs and a boston terrier that weights 18lbs and they are both ALL over the place in the back seat. I've had other seat covers that slide all over the place and end up not really protecting the seat, but not this one. I put it on and haven't had to adjust it since.There are only a few things I would change if I could:1. The seat belt slots do not have velcro. At the end of the day, I'm not sure how much difference this would actually make, but I'd feel better if I could seal those openings closed.2. Color options. From what I saw the only option was brown/tan. Which looks great...especially since the seat cover stays where it is supposed to...but I can't think help but think how much nicer it would look if I could've gotten black to match the rest of my interior. Again, something that doesn't REALLY matter as long as the seat cover is doing it's job.",dogs,3

"I went through 2 of these before I finally just went with the flat wide leash. My dog likes to chase squirrels up trees and the leash would get caught on the bark, within 2 weeks the leash had already started to tear. I returned it for a new one, making sure this time I would be more careful about her catching things with it, but again it did the same thing. I finally went with the flat wide retractable leash and it is much much better, we have had it for 2 months now and no signs what so ever of tearing. This model itself is light and fast retracting with a great easy to use stop button on it. I could attach it to my bag and go hands free with assistance of a carabiner. If your dog doesn't wrap around or catch things with their leash I do recommend this product!",dogs,3

I bought this for our miniature schnauzer who at 13 years old has developed some kind of food allergy and has been licking his paws raw. After 6 weeks he is not licking nearly as much. I'm hoping a longer use will break him of it. He also has really bad arthritis and has been on medication for it. A curious side effect of this food has been a tremendous increase in his energy level and he no longer wakes up sore and no longer whines when he stretches. He also is a lot faster on the steps and doesn't hesitate like he has been doing for two years. He has been off his medication for the last month and still he just overall seems like he feels much better and I see no difference in his behavior with or without the medication. I can only assume that whatever was in his food before was increasing the inflamation. Overall we're really happy with the food.,cats,2
I own two of these attractive pet carriers. We use them at home and for travel with our mini-schnauzer. They are very well-made and give him enough room to sleep and move around.

"Our 80 pound dog has been using the store-n-feed elevated dog feeder for about two months now. She loves it! It seems to work really well. She doesn't get water all over the place. It is very easy to clean by wiping down the plastic. I thought that I would like the self water system but I don't use it anymore. The water gets dirty and if you need to clean out the water part, you have to lift the entire top part off of the feeder. So it is not convenient at all to use the self water system. But, with both metal bowls, one with food and the other with water, it works just fine. It is high enough so that my dog doesn't have to bend down anymore.",dogs,3

"This is a nice addition to my puppy's crate - the softness, fit - but it doesn't have any cushiness in the bottom of the bed. The fabric is nice like the sides, but the cushiness of the sides needs to also be on the bottom. It is thin and rests on the hard plastic of the crate bottom. I put a folded blanket in with the bed to make it more comfy, but that makes the crate too small and uneven.. I also had some shrinkage when I washed and dried it. Some reviewers said they liked the padded edge, but my puppy can't rest his head there - he's then up against the wire of the crate sides. All that said, my puppy hasn't complained.",dogs,3
"Like alot of online shoppers who love their pets, I researched this item before buying. I even read the Scoop Free website and saw all the rave reviews! Well, here's my take on this item:IT STINKS!I have two cats. The instructions swear that you can set up this box and leave it for 15 days with 2 cats. Well, I set it up. The cats liked it well enough. But the problem came as soon as they began to deposit solid waste into it.IT STUNK UP THE ENTIRE HOUSE from the FIRST time the cats used it!The waste receptacle (that they claim you can leave for the magic 15 days) got FULL with normal use within THREE DAYS!!!! The solid waste began to get caught behind the rake as well.Did I mention that this box is LOUD as well?? And LARGE/bulky.So make sure you get this item from a place that you can easily RETURN it if you find the review I wrote here to be your experience! I took mine back on the third day and got a full refund.I now use the normal litterbox with crystal litter and its great for us.",cats,2

This way she doesn't need to be penned up or crated, if she has to potty, there's no mess. I hose the diaper off and then toss it in the washer.

I used this heater for about 2 years with a 50 gallon reef tank. After 2 years it developed an internal leak which shorted out the heating coils and tripped my ground fault circuits. In addition to shorting the coils a small amount of water was leaking from the temperature adjustment knob. Because this is the only in-line heater I have found I purchased a second unit to replace the first one. After 2 months it also developed an internal leak and shorted the heating coils. I am now using an in-tank heater.If anyone knows of a good inline heater to use instead of this one please let me know.,fish aquatic pets,4

"I recently did remodels of my bathrooms and the old traditional enclosed litter box just didn't work with the new decor. I decided to try this style despite some misgivings based on reports of flimsiness, cheap looking, fake looking plant, etc. It is pricey...but it is the only thing like it I could find on the market. It arrived very quickly and I was pleasantly surprised at its appearance. It looks exactly as I had pictured...it is plastic afterall...so it won't look like a true ceramic planter...but it's fine. I like the fact that it is light because when it has several inches of litter in it you can still lift it if necessary. I found it very easy to remove and replace the top once I did it a few times and figured out the best way to hold onto the top and line up the grooves. I don't use the plant in the bathroom as it is too big for the small room, but I put the plant on the cats' tree house and they like to hide behind it and give it the occasional swat. Instead I put river rocks in the top part of the new box and glued them down..and they look great. Finally, and most importantly, the cats LOVE LOVE LOVE it. They climbed right into it as soon as it was set up. They are big guys (15+lbs) and it gives them plenty of room to turn around and toss litter to their hearts' content without piling it on the floor. I suppose my only criticism would be that the round shape makes it a little harder to scoop with a typical style scooper..but the other features far outweigh that minor issue.",cats,2

"I've found my pup has quickly ascertained that none of her toys that look like animals are real and hence, she is not very interested, only casually and then she favors other more plush, easy to squeak or make noise toys. I placed the toy outside and brought her and she looked at it and just sat down and smelled the air! I have the large and small squirrels (mistakenly thinking the would be a sure fire HIT!) Sigh!, but the he quality of the squeakers on the small toy aren't so hot, the squeaker in the body is very hard to get at and it's great there is one in the tail but it is like having about of stiff acrylic fabric in your mouth. It's a great price, but I have to say this is not my favorite AKC toy for my 13 lb dog, the pheasant is. It is not very plush or soft either. I'm a Coleman dog toy fan but they just don't make toys for small dogs! But the quality really makes a difference to to my dog and I can make them squeak easily but bouncing them on the floor - not so with AKC. And for all that are having a blast with this toy, yay! I'll update my review happily my dog changes her mind. I've exposed her to Dogtronics toys (cannot wait for their new line) that appeal to the hunting insinct however and other interactive toys, so maybe her expectations a bit higher. It's nice AKC are making smaller toys, because small dogs also have hunting instincts.",dogs,3

"We adopted our 8-year-old kitty from a shelter last year. She had been adopted out twice already and returned to the shelter because she wouldn't use a litter box. We felt like she was the perfect cat for us, but we were nervous about her past history. We brought her home that day with a bag of Cat Attract that the shelter recommended. She has used her box perfectly for us. This is a fantastic product! Great for kitties with litter box problems. Also it clumps really well, has little dust and is natural-smelling (I am allergic to strong artificial fragrances). I won't use anything else, it is worth the extra expense.",cats,2

"I live in a small apartment with 3 cats and one dog. The cats (especially my 1 and 4 year old ones) seemed to take great delight in seeing how much litter and poop they could fling out of their old hooded box with the front opening. Not to mention my dog, who loved being able to reach in and grab little ""snacks"", leaving a trail of litter behind for me to clean up. YUCK! Now the litter flinging problem has been resolved - the brat cats can scratch down to China if they want to and the litter stays in the box! What little bit remains on their feet stays in the grooves in the top...and my dog no longer has cat poop breath! Halleluya! It took a while for them to get used to the top entry, but now it's old hat. I use bio-degradable clumping litter and keep the box in the bathroom so cleaning out the waste is a snap. Both the litter and design of the box keep down the odor and I'm not dust-busting the floor every hour!! My prayers have been answered. Yes, it was a bit pricey but boy is it worth it - especially when walking around the apartment bare foot! Thanks, Clevercat!!",cats,2

"I first saw this toy at a home I pet sit at occasionally. The adult golden retriever there absolutely loves it and the toy has been there the last couple of times I had so I figured it would be pretty durable. I bought a large one for my 2 2-yr old Springer Spaniels and while they loved it it only lasted for about 15 minutes before it got its first hole. Its a really soft rubber so it doesnt slam against my kitchen floor like other treat toys which is nice, but it also made it easier for the dogs to bite in to it. It dispenses treats well enough to keep them intersted and is nice because you can squeeze different sized treats in it to make it harder for it to come out. If I didnt have pups that like to chew things apart it would be a great toy, unfortunately it just wasn't durable enough for my dogs so I'm only giving it 3 stars.",dogs,3

"I used to walk and train large dogs and standardly used the Gentle Leader. The Gentle Leader is a must-have for owners who want to humanely train their dog to walk on a leash and follow commands without being pulled by the dog. The Gentle Leader goes over the dog's snout and clasps at the back of the neck. Your regular leash attaches to a ring that hangs below the chin (it is part of the Gentle Leader). Any time the dog pulls on the leash, his/her head will turn instead, which prevents him/her from pulling you. The dog doesn't get choked like pinch collars and collars with spikes do.All puppy and dog owners should use the Gentle Leader to train their pets to walk on a leash and follow commands. It gives you more control over the dog, which is safer for both of you, and makes training your dog to walk on a leash easier.",dogs,3

My cat adores this scratch pad. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I think it's ridiculously overpriced for a piece of cardboard. The alternative though is that my cat scratches my furniture or carpet. Not a day goes by that you don't hear him in the other room scratching away at his scrach pad. It's a must have at our house. I use to be able to buy these very affordably at Walmart but they have quit carrying them unforunately and because I live in a smaller town that leaves me buying them on Amazon unless we're out of town and then I pick some up at Petsmart for a bit cheaper.,cats,2
"I have owned German Shepard's my entire live, with all the positives come unfortunatly some negitives mostly as a result of over breeding. I purchased this product for a 4 yr. oldmix with a dull, dry coat that I was able to see improvement in in a couple of weeks. If the glucosimine is benificial so much the better. I will buy this to add to a already premium dry foodon a regular basis. Try this product.",dogs,3
"Royal Canin has kept all its promises -- my dogs digest it well, have no problems, good health, and small stools! It is so digestible that dogs can be switched to it without problem, I see that all the time when someone else's dog comes over and has a meal here -- no problems at all. I've been feeding for 15 years. When new foods come out, we always try them, but end up going back to Royal Canin as it keeps their weight just right and they love it. I raise Whippets and Brussels Griffons. [...]",cats,2

"I needed a strong collar for our growing pup who is now about 50 lbs. After escaping from a quick release collar, I searched for a leather, buckle type. This is exactly what I was looking for. It also has the metal ring on the back for quick and easy attaching of the leash. The dog tag can then be attached to the buckle. I really love this collar and will be buying another as soon as the dog grows out of this one.",dogs,3
"We have had this cat tree for almost a month. The box was beat up when it arrived but fortunately no damage to the tree. It was nice that it was assembled. Those are the good things. The sisal is pulling away from the tall post and the cats are tearing the carpet up. The shorter pole is covered in carpet and my one cat has already stripped the carpet from one side of it. It looks nice, is a good height, very sturdy, and the cats like sleeping in it but definitely poor quality workmanship and and material. I'm very disappointed after spending over $130. My cheap faux fur cat tree is in better shape after three years.",cats,2
"Works great in my '05 Hyundai Tucson. Durable, stylish looks. Goes together easily (less than five minutes). Cheaper than comparable units on the big box pet store websites (and many more positive reviews). The only thing I don't like is that the top feet don't hit the ceiling of my car tightly. This is because the ceiling slopes down where the feet hit. Swivel-type feet on the top of the legs would make this five stars. But the unit hasn't slipped, so it's not a huge dealbreaker. I just hope it doesn't mar the fabric in the ceiling...",dogs,3
"From start to finish, no problems. Item arrived as requested one day early.My dog is healthier because he has been on SD since a pup.",dogs,3

"My cats adore this fountain, and I adore only having to refill it once a week or so (I have 3 cats). One of my cats is so in love with the fountain that he stands sentinel by the dishwasher whenever it's being cleaned. Once it broke (my fault for letting it run dry), and I had to order a new one; it took about a week to come in, and I swear he was in mourning the whole time. Most cats don't drink enough water, and I believe mine are drinking more as a result of this fountain. A good buy!",cats,2
"Awesome price, and works like a charm!!! Great way to have your pet do their business in one area, or for whatever your intended purpose. I like the several ways it can be set up. Very easy to change or move.",dogs,3
"I use this intermittently at times of high stress for my cats, especially since one has physical conditions worsened by stress. My cats have never gotten along well with one another and this did not change that. They also always use the litterbox, so I did not have that kind of serious behavioral stuff to deal with. But, this DID help with stress (within one month my spouse moved out, I was away for 5 days and then I moved. (kitties hate moving, that prowling around the boxes is not fun exploring, it is anxious, exhausting territory remapping.)) It did really lessen their fearful and heightened territorial behavior at that time. I've used it subsequently now and then during absences and for another move. It does help. As a bonus, it seems to have stopped the scratcher-girl from ruining the furniture. I think all the literature is plain that it doesn't work for all cats or all circumstances. You also have to be pretty tuned in to your cat's behavior to notice this more subtle kind of behavioral stuff. You can find articles about it on the internet, search ""feliway"" (comfort zone is a brand name.) I have to say that by reading the description I could readily tell that this was a refill, I use a plug- in diffuser and this. I think it might be available in another form to put directly on furniture or other spots, not sure about that.",cats,2
"Been using this on my dogs for over three years. Great product and Amazon has it at a great price. If I got it thru my vet it would cost a lot more.

"This is one of those YMMV things (your mileage may vary). There are alot of people who love it and some who don't. I have to say I really did not care for this litter box.-The litter falls out through the cracks on the sides because the clips do not hold the top nd bottom together very tightly. It was also way too small for my cats. I have a cat who is has some mental retardation from a near death experience on the operating table. He had a real problem fitting in it and would end up just sticking his butt out and end of peeing on the floor.-Not all the clumps would fall into the drawer. Then I would have to clean it out with a scooper.-You can only fill it with a small amount of litter or else when you turned it on its side the litter falls out the opening. The clumps then have a greater chance of sticking to the litter box and not falling through the grill.I think this has potential, especially if it were bigger and the bottom and hood fit snuggly. From the reviews it obviously works for some people, just not for me. I will continue looking for the litter box of my dreams.",cats,2
I have to give my cat a pill twice a day. It was a struggle for both of us every time until we got these. Now he likes taking his pill and life is much easier.,cats,2

"When I read that this was a ""swing gate"", I took that to believe it had a door portion that would swing open. That is not the case. You have to mount this to both sides of the walls then detach one side to ""swing"" the entire gate open. It is not what I was looking for. On top of that, we got it because we have a very wide space in our kitchen that we needed to close off for our 11 week old Pomeranian puppy, but the slots in this gate are too wide and he can actually get through the gate! So for us, this gate is totally useless. Unfortunately, I discovered this on the 4th day I had it and I didn't realize that Amazon's free return policy expired 2 days after it is delivered, so we are stuck with this.We ended up purchasing another tension mounted gate with a REAL swing door which will be arriving tomorrow. I hope the slots aren't as wide so it keeps our puppy within it's confines.",dogs,3
This toy seemed like a good idea (and probably is for kittens) but my adult cats thought it was really boring and they refused to play with it at all.,cats,2
"We gave this to Lola, our 1 and a half year old active Boston Terrier. She loved it immediately. She chases squirrels in the yard, so we thought this would be a good substitute. It does look like a squirrel, have a nice crinkly tail and a nice squeaker.But, within 15 minutes, she had surgically removed the crinkler from the tail. Another 5 minutes, and she removed the squeaker. She managed to do both without removing any stuffing (she's talented), but that was next.The weak point of this toy is that the big, bushy tail is stitched all the way from the squirrel's rearend to halfway up his back. So, a dog that's apt with his or her forepaws can easily hold it down and rend with her teeth (which is exactly what our dog did).Lola loves stuffed toys, but they don't last long. I would pay good money to get her a toy she could love on that would last more than two months.",dogs,3
"I have a hyperactive Belgian Malinois. I was wanting something that would calm her for visitors to our home, and going out into public, as she tends to be very high strung and easily excited.

Maybe it will work for some other breed, or for cats.",cats,2

So about a week ago she woke me up 4 times in a single night with her barking and whining ""from her not wanting to be in crate"" I decided I had enough. Long story short I bought this product put it on her, she barked one time and not again since then. This product works better than I expected it to. I read the reviews and was kind of not wanting to buy this product because of some of the bad ones, but sure glad I did now. This product is worth every penny I spent on it. Thanks!!!",dogs,3
"I ordered the gate and these 2 extension pieces to corral my hyper min-pins on my deck. The opening is very wide (86""), and this was the only thing I could find that would fit the opening. It is rather flimsy, so unless you've smaller doglets, I would not recommend this to anyone who has larger, more active dogs. Assembly was also interesting as one finds out exactly how out of square a space can be when trying to match up one end with another and cutting and piecing together all the gate parts/extensions was trying to say the least. And, yes, there was some cutting required which was done with a square...unfortunately the opening was NOT! Yep, quite the project. But would I buy it again? Yes, I'd be forced to because of the size alone. And in the heat and humidity in south Florida, I expect it won't be long before I am doing so. It's already beginning to rust!!",dogs,3

I was concerned about getting a plastic bowl although I use the thick indestructible farm animal type bowls for my lab as her regular bowl for water and feeding.

"We saw this product work at someone else's home when our dogs were also there. The barking of four dogs was quickly controlled. However, after purchasing for our own home, it only actually worked on one of our chihuahua's. Our other chihuahua would get angry at it and bark at the controller each time it emitted the sound. That put undue stress on our other chihuahua (the one that didn't bark) -- so we had to remove the batteries.",dogs,3

"These treats can create a very serious problem. I just opened the new bag I bought from Amazon and gave one to each of my three dogs and TWO OF THEM GOT THEM STUCK IN THEIR THROATS. Both were choking and both had to have them pried out of their mouths by my husband and I. Very scary. I have thrown them out. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY THESE. Based on their shape, size and the fact that when they get wet they get sticky, they can choke your dog. DON'T BUY THESE. PERIOD.",dogs,3

So far my dog isn't interested in this toy at all. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do about that. Concept for the toy is great but I guess you've gotta have a dog that actually likes this to work. Maybe he'll show interest later. After all he is new to toys.,dogs,3

My girlfriend who is fussier then I am said it smelled horrible. I don't know. I barely noticed it.What I did notice was the fact that my cat's completely ignored the stuff. I sprayed it on our door to keep them from rushing to the door when we open it. When I cam home from work, ran right up like always.I'm giving this product one star because it seems to have no effect whatsoever on my cats.",cats,2

"Up until last summer I had never used advantage. I was a frontline person. Last year the fleas were so bad, frontline wouldnt give any type of relief at all! I switched to advantage around may last year and never looked back. This year the fleas are going to be even worse. I ordered this and had to give lots of baths until it got here. I put this on my dogs and cats last night before bed. One of my cats slept on the couch..this morning, its covered in dead fleas. Same with the dog cages and unfortunately, my bed as that is where another cat slept. I have lots of vaccuming and laundry to do, but the FLEAS ARE DEAD!!!! yay! Use this stuff....it works!",dogs,3

Of Course, my little Willow is not much bigger than either of these stuffed toys, but that doesn't stop him from carrying them around like they are nothing. The workmanship on these toys are of such great quality and durability, it's unbelievable! Even thought they are really great for puppies, they are also great for older dogs too!!!",dogs,3

It clumps around the doo-doo and ""moisture deposits"" which makes clean up REALLY EASY.

(dog rolls in dead stuff or poop right after you washed them and back in the bath they must go) She stays soft and feels clean forever with a great shine. Before I could only use certain all natural colloidal oatmeal shampoos but she was only soft when conditioned and only for a couple days after the wash. this shampoo is worlds better! She has a short to medium coarse 2 layer coat.",cats,2

"You buy a crate expecting it will confine your dog; crates should be made with the expectation the animal will at least make a token attempt at escape. I adopted a 55-pound pit bull and purchased this crate. It took Gemma 15 minutes to work free the first time. I examined the crate and found I had assembled it correctly. By the fourth time, she'd determined a quick escape method and could escape in 5 minutes. At least I know she's intelligent and amenable to training.",dogs,3
"I have German Shepherds and 2 of the 3 are bad food gulpers. They would eat 2 cups of kibble in blazing speed and I always worried about bloat. I was putting 2 large rocks in their bowls to help slow them down, but I really wanted a better solution. Last year I came across the brake-fast bowls. BEST investment in my dogs' health aside from regular vet care! They eat MUCH slower, and therefore eat less, since they can digest it better. The bowls do slide across the floor-which I happen to like. It slows them down even more. They wash up nicely and after a year still look fantastic-no rough edges at all. Even the non-gulper is fed with one of these-a small investment compared to the $3000-$5000 surgery for bloat and the huge fatality rate associated with it.",cats,2

"My dog use to itch a lot and at first I thought it was fleas. After checking him, I realized that he had no fleas but it appeared to be bug bites and some rashes on him. In addition, he had flaky skin so I had to do something about it.At first I tried using puppy shampoo since it's not as harsh on the skin, but that didn't work. Then I used oatmeal shampoo, which was suggested by a pet store sales lady and that didn't help either. I started to do some research online and I came across this product. I read reviews on it and it seemed to be a great product. I had to give it a try.It's been 2 weeks since I have been using this shampoo on my dog and it is terrific! All of his rashes, flaky skin, and what it appeared to be bug bites are all gone! I was amazed and most of all, he stopped scratching like crazy.:::UPDATE 1/8/2011:::I've decided to give you folks an update on my dog that was using this product. It was working for awhile and then for some reason his itchy symptoms came back. Perhaps he became immune to it? So over the years I have been using all sorts of different doggie shampoos and my VET suggested I try a product called Douxo - Chlorhexidine PS Shampoo DOGS & CATS. So far that has been the best shampoo for my dog. Not only did my doggie stopped scratching a lot but also his coat looks very soft, shiny, healthy and his bald spots that he got from his sores has disappeared. I have been using Douxo for approximately 6 months now. It's a little pricey but so worth seeing my dog happy and not in pain.:::UPDATE 11/28/2012:::FYI - The ingredient ""Chlorhexidine"" works best for his skin allergies. Im actually using another brand that has more of that ingredient called ""ChlorHex 2X"" from Vedco & it's been the best product for my dog and easier on my wallet! I've been using this product for over a year now and he seems to have a lot less breakouts. Yayeee, finally found the right product for me & my pooch. CHEERS!",cats,2

"The Gentle Leader collar worked the first time I used it. I have a 75 pound ""puppy"" for the summer who is very active. I love to go for walks but his constant pulling and tugging made me dread our daily outings. After watching the entire video that came with the collar, I followed the instructions carefully and my dog and I went for a no stress walk. There was absolutely no tension on the leash at all. I would suggest that since this collar type may feel unnatural to the dog, follow the CD's instructions and use treats to help your dog get used to it. I highly recommend this product!",dogs,3
"This is an excellent cat litter especially for the rollover type of cat litter box. It reduces odor, is less powdery, and clumps well. The only negative is that too much of the litter comes with the clumps at times. But it still stretches the length of time that your cat litter lasts and the cats love it. It's much more economical to purchase over the premium version although the premium version is slightly heavier and doesn't waste as much.",cats,2
"Update *Jun 2011*The battery in the collar went dead within 3 weeks, even though the device has not been in use consistently over the few weeks. A bit disappointed in that, will now have to try and find a replacement if i can source it.Been using this anti-bark collar on my dogs for a couple weeks now and still hoping to reap greater success. The collar actually deters barking once fitted to both dogs, as they easily desist upon the first bout of excessive barking. However once the collar has been removed, they just go back to business as usual. I actually was hoping that the device would eventually deter excessive barking even when not being worn. I guess either the dogs are not as brilliant, or the collar needs to be supplemented. So i'd be forced to keep the device strapped to the dogs permanently, and i'm not a huge fan of that idea.- Collar does prevent excessive barking- However has not resulted in a change in behaviour (once removed) after couple weeks.- Still hoping for the best.",dogs,3
"My puppy is an Australian Shepherd so I have to keep him mentally occupied to keep him out of trouble, settled down and quiet. There have been so many times where this treat ball has saved the day. A handful of puppy food, a handful of cheerios and some broken up pieces of dog cookie and there is a different treat that pops out everytime. My pup is obsessed with it! He rolls it all over the floor and i can hear it all over the house. When ever I hear that familiar rattle of food rolling around in the ball, it is such a comfort knowing he's completely out of trouble when he's out of my sight.I love that this makes it to where not all the treats can fall out at once. It isn't just a hole in a ball. I don't know what's going on inside that ball, but the treats have to go through some sort of puzzle or something inside to make it's way out. It's a mystery what is going on in there. But if I held it upside down, you would think all the treats would just pour out of it....not so! You actually have to keep rotating it to get a few pieces each time.My Aussie LOVES to work for his treats and this is perfect!",dogs,3
The PetSafe Wireless Fence system is just fantastic!! I purchased the system 30 months ago and my dog never crossed the border! It is perfect. Recently my son moved in with a LARGE dog and I purchased the extra collar/receiver. One time around my lot and he knew where to stay. He hasn't once crossed the border either. This system is SOOOOOO much cheaper than installing a fence!!!! I find it truly trust-worthy! Naturally it doesn't keep other animals out of your yard - but definitely keeps your dog or dogs where they belong.,dogs,3

We adopted two kitties 5 weeks ago. The no kill shelter used KMR for getting the kitties off to a good start and recommended its continued use for a few months. KMR has all things good for kittens and cats without the very negative side effects of giving cats cows milk. Because this product is a powder to be mixed as needed you do not have to worry about a short shelf life. While the 5 pound bag is expensive it gets your kitty off to a very good start and will last for a very long time.,cats,2

This I bought to refill the spray bottles I bought of it. The oil is really the best for your dog's hair and skin. I used it when my dog had a bout with an allergy and it relieved the itchiness in a flash. His hair after I gave him a treatment with this was soft and sliky and now use it for both our doggies when I groom them. It also smells great. Emu oil keeps their coats silky. Amazon solely carries this product and that is a good thing especially when you are a Prime member as I am.,cats,2
We love this thing. It works great. We've had one for 10 years and it finally broke. This one seems to work just as well.,cats,2

"I bought Advantage for both cats under 9 lbs and dogs under 10 lbs for my parents. They have 3 cats and 2 dogs that became subject to a plague of fleas during the 2 weeks I was visiting.I've used Frontline for my 2 dogs in the past and was very happy with it, but for 5 animals Frontline is a big expense. Advantage is a little less expensive. I researched the differences between the two and basically it comes down to Frontline will also handle ticks whereas Advantage is just for fleas. People seemed happy with both products.Biospot is cheaper than both but totally useless. I was a little anxious about using Advantage without knowing if it worked as well as Frontline.We put it on all the animals the afternoon the package arrived. That night one of the cats was sitting on me. I got up to go to the store and noticed two fleas on me. Later she was on me again and when I got up there were 8! She moved to my father's lap and when he got up he had 17 on him. All the fleas were dying and moving from their food source, but alas it was too late for them.I didn't realize how many fleas the animals had. Advantage worked great. I am not sure how it will do in the long run, but the pets are relieved for now.I still use Frontline for my dogs because we go hiking where there are ticks galore. Advantage is a good solution for my folks because their pets stay indoors or their yard. I think the applicator is easier to use with Advantage. None of our pets had any adverse effects from using either product.",dogs,3
Grizzly Salmon oil was recommended by the local pet store to help my yellow labs skin allergies. I have been using it for about 8 months to help with reddening and itching of her paws. This along with elimination of certain snacks has helped a great deal. It is certainly cheaper online than retail.,dogs,3
"We bought this because we were going to see my daughter and knew we'd need to have our 11 pound dachshound on a leash. It worked fine for a few days then the end started looking all worn out in spots. I tied knots to help hold the thing together, then it just stopped recoiling. It's just not worth wasting the money on the thing.",dogs,3

"I DECIDED ABOUT A YEAR AGO TO START CUTTING MY DOGS HAIR AT HOME. BOTH FOR CONVIENCE AND SAVING ON THE COST OF A GROOMER. I PURCHASED A WAHL HAIR CLIPPER TO START CUTTING MY DOGS HAIR. THE COST OF THE TRIMMER WAS RESONABLE ABOUT $30 WITH ATTACHMENTS, AND MY DOG IS A SHEPARD MIX. THE WAHL WORKS OK, BUT HAD A DIFFICULT TIME CUTTING THOUGH CERTAIN AREAS ON MY DOGS FUR. DECIDING THAT MY DOG WILL LET ME CUT HIS HAIR WITHOUT ME CHASING HIM WHILE TRYING TO CUT HIS HAIR, AND KNOWING THAT I COULD GIVE HIM A DECENT CUT I DECIDED TO INVEST IN A BETTER QUAILTY CUTTER. AFTER RESEARCHING DIFFERENT DOG TIMMERS, I DECIDED ON THE OSTER GOLDEN A5 2 SPEED CLIPPER WITH THE NUMBER 10 BLADE IT COMES WITH. THE QUALITY OF THE OSTER, AND HOW FAST IT CUTS MY DOGS HAIR IS EFFORTLESS NOW. IT WILL TRIM ANY PART OF HIS FUR, THICK AREAS, MATTED HAIR, AROUND PAWS, ETC. AND ONLY HAVE TO MAKE A SINGLE PASS AND THE HAIR IS TRIMMED. THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT AND SAVES TIME OVER THE LOWER COST CUTTERS. THE INTERCHANGEABLE BLADES ARE VERY EASY TO SWAP MAKING IT A VERY FEXIABLE CUTTER. WHEN CUTTING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, THE CUTTER GETS A LITTLE WARM, BUT NEVER A PROBLEM.",cats,2
"Our cats were throwing up often, one nearly every day. The frequent messes on carpets, beds, sofa, etc. were a real drag. (And I'm sure it was no picnic for the cats, either.) We tried several high-end foods, and nothing seemed to work. But after transitioning to this one, the vomiting has stopped almost completely. (And the last time one puked, it was after someone gave her too many cat treats.)Yes, the price is high. (But not if it saves fruitless trips to the vet.) And I'm not happy to hear the comments about fillers, and allegations of poor quality. (For the prices they charge, Hill's should be able to use the best-quality ingredients.) But the bottom line is that this product worked better than I ever expected it to, where other brands had failed. So we're sticking with it for now.",cats,2
"I recommend this toy, it's a good way to avoid that the puppies bite your furniture or your shoes!... The red part has favor and the dogs spend hours trying to eat all the bone. It's a good investment.",dogs,3
"My 14lbs terrior mix has a mind of her own. Try as we did, she would not stay in the yard, and we live out in the country in a gated community, and fences are frowned upon. We live on a river, and the deer are thick out here...lots of distractions for a little dog. Long story short, she got the idea about the flags being the limit, but with the collar set on the second setting, she was not discouraged from just running through the boundry. Reset the collar to the third position, and after one last run past the boundry, she discovered that she really likes staying away from those flags. I shocked myself before I tried it on her, and it is similar to a static discharge from shuffling your feet on a carpet. We are in the third week of training, and I really feel comfortable letting her run outside without fear of her running away. A consideration is that other dogs have no problem coming into my yard, so THEY can still be a threat to my little dog. It took me about 2 hours to install the system. I put the control box in the attic to keep it out of the weather, and just ran the wire behind a gutter down spout, to the ground. I do have a split rail fence around part of my yard, and just stapled the wire to the bottom of the lower rail. I would buy this product again. If my single minded dog learned, any dog can. Even my wife, who thought this was akin to animal torture, is happy we have this installed.",dogs,3
"I got three of these as gifts -- the Platypus, Dragon and Duck.All three appear to be very well made, and look like they're going to be a lot of fun. They were larger than I expected about 10&#34; or so long -- and the squeakers appear to be fairly standard. Once the dogs to whom they are gifted have fun destroying them, I'll post an update on their durability.",dogs,3
We got this for our 8 week old puppy and she still loves to bring it everywhere we go a month later. The batteries inside were corroded and didn't work when we got it but she still loved it so I gave it a 5 star. Plus it always calms her down so... Whatever works!,dogs,3
"Ever Clean is the best cat litter I've used - between switching to a high-quality cat food and using this litter, you wouldn't even know I have cats.",cats,2
not quite what it appears to be in the picture as the one I received does not have the little door flap but an attachment that directs the food down into the dish with clearance for the food but not for little paws to get up into. I got the medium size for two cats and it works well with catfood. I had to get a replacement for another unit I had that my cat figured out how to put his paw up inside and flick the auger to get more food out. He eventually broke the auger. I do not this this will be a problem with the unit. One other thing to be aware is the auger in this unit turns very slowly so it will take 30-60 seconds to dispense a portion. I thought it wasn't working when I first plugged it in to test it out.,cats,2

"After 3 training sessions our runaway cocker spaniel is now perfect off leash! I never would have thought I could have so much fun with him (and trust in him) off leash. There are some complaints about battery power but if you turn the collar off when not using it, the batteries last quite a long time. Plus you can buy replacements in bulk on amazon. Followed training instructions precisely but used a 30 ft training leash (and a pocket full of treats). Also, he was a pretty good dog anyways (apart from bolting), and a smart dog, beforehand. Ie not sure all dogs would be as trainable but this was definitely the right tool for him. Completely changed him and now we can do so many fun things off leash.",dogs,3
"I have 2 cats that seem to enjoy taking their wet food out of the bowl or moving the bowl all over the floor. Between the mess and the noise, they were driving me crazy!

"I have purchased the Dr. Noy's Extra small bear, small rabbit, and medium lamb from Amazon. I have a smallish breed - he's a pup at around 10 lbs and should max out at around 15. His favorite of his animals is by far his medium sized lamb. He carries it with him everywhere. He has managed to put some holes in all three of his Dr. Noy's, so they definitely aren't indestructible, but they are very sturdy. He is teething currently and they are withstanding that phase for the most part. The medium has an advantage of having a designated pouch inside the toy for the squeaker that the extra small and small didn't have. It makes the toy a little bulkier in the middle and adds some extra popping protection for the squeaker. Great toy!",dogs,3
Our 2 kittens really like these balls. They are soft and colorful. They enjoy chasing and attacking the balls. We put a few in a card board box with small round holes in each side and the kittens love to bat the balls and try and get them through the holes. They also loke to attack each other as one kitten will go inside the box and the other outside. Both kittens enjoy the balls. They appear well made and are a good value for the money.,cats,2
I have a 15 year old Retriever/Chow best friend. She is healthy for her age but takes pain medication for arthritis so she needs to be tested every 6 months to ensure that the meds don't harm her kidneys and liver. Before using this product her urine concentration was borderline. Now that I use the Renal Essentials her tests are up in the very good level and the Vet is very pleased with her kidney function.The only downside is that my dog doesn't like the taste so I have to hide it in her food or put pnut butter on it to get her to eat it. It's worth it when the product works.,dogs,3
"I was setting up my house for a new cat that I decided to adopt from a local pet store's weekend shelter adoption program. I was concerned that with all the changes and stresses of an adult cat getting a new home she wouldn't like the litter box. But, there was no problem. She knew exactly what it was, that it was hers, and took to it right away. She liked watching the rake move and the sound didn't frighten her. She's a very shy kitty that likes to hide, too.I do scoop the poop out after a couple weeks, and then once more after a week, and then toss it out altogether on the fourth weekend. The litter's dehydration property works, but it doesn't shrink it enough to not need to scoop. Since I have just one medium sized cat, the cartridges will last a whole month and not stink as long as I do the simple maintenance already mentioned.It is easy to clean since everything is already collected into one area. You're not sifting the entire box trying to find stuff. Then you just stir the crystals that aren't under the trap lid and you're good to go. There has been no urine smell or leakage. I'm on the 5th month of owning this litterbox.Some pet stores do not carry the cartridges. Luckily, amazon has the free shipping, so if you just order them at the beginning of the month of the last cartridge, replacements will arrive on time. I wish they didn't cost so much, but it is a convenience to not have to scoop every day.",cats,2
"I always grew up with a cat and the thought of empting a litterbox was mindnumbing. Given I love my cat, but what comes out of her.. Well that is another story. Having recently adopted a kitten I found myself back in the pet arena. I talked around the get ideas with automated litterbox and narrowed it down between the Littermain and Scoopfree. I was sold on the Scoopfree (the idea of only emptying the litterbox once a month sold me). I have been using the box flawlessly. There is NO odor associated with the unit, and much to my surprise my kitten took right to it. It has a higher rim which helps contain the pellets, yet my 8 week old kitten has no trouble navigating in and out. Only drawback is a low hum when the unit self cleans after 20 minutes, however small price to pay to just plug it in and leave it.High marks in my book! Bravo! Just cannot wait till they invent a litterbox that only needs maintence once a YEAR ;-)",cats,2
"Good quality, easy to install. A little cumbersome trying to cut out the back plastic for the filter, but overall worth the money, and it is easy to clean.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Works okay if your cat's feces are big enough for that litter. I have two cats, two diffrent sizes.Small feces are not collected by litter, they return in previous place. After that you need to use regular scoop to remove them. If you use flashable filler, you'll get super result - dream cat litter. You don't need to scoop and smell all that stinky stuff.",cats,2
My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it.,dogs,3
"This little carrier is perfect for my new extra tiny kitten. It was easy to put together, is nice and airy, sturdy, doesn't weigh much, and is perfect for a very feminine kitten.

"My chihuahua pup loves these. I've tried them out on labradors and greyhounds as well - gone in a flash (so buy in bulk or use as occasional treats only.)I prefer to buy Merrick's treats over the typical brands in the pet supermarts - those are often imported from Brazil, and I don't trust those manufacturers.One of these lasts for my 6 lb. chihuahua pup for 2 weeks or so. One of the great things about these, is that if you offer enough inviting, organic dried animal treats like these - your pup may choose mostly to chew approved-only materials.The one possible downside to offering a puppy dried animal parts like this, is that my chi never would chew on a Kong after getting use to this sort of treat. He has no interest in any nylon or plastic chew, which is a bummer, because they last much longer. Oh well.",dogs,3
"This product works really great and doesn't seem to stain or anything. Our Cockapoo puppy is in her chewing phase and we were having all kinds of problems with her chewing things. So we bought this and it works well. She sometimes even makes this cute little whine when we spray things complaining that we're taking her fun away.I've found that for things like leashes and shoes that rub against other things all day this wears off quickly and you need to spray them every 2-4 days, but for things like cords, cables and the bottoms of chairs I haven't had to respray as the only thing rubbing against them and wearing off the spray is the puppy who's no longer doing so.",dogs,3
"Wow...what a help. I really strugled getting pills in my cat till I got these.....which I can't find in ANY pet store. The others are just too thick for a cats mouth. ( and usually found in the Dog asile ) And rather than just ""drop"" the pill into the cats mouth like the others do....it ""shoots"" the pill in making it so much easier getting it into the throat so they can't spit it out. Downside was it came with no instructions, so I had to figure that part out. What you will find is that there is resistence if you try to pull the plunger out. Like it won't come out. But just give it a tug and it will. load the pill on the tip, then put the plunger back in...to the point or resistence..get the device where you want it in your cats mouth...and then push the plundger past that resistence point....and it ..""shoots"" the pill into the cats mouth. Hope that bit of info was helpful.",cats,2

"What you see is exactly what you are getting. This is an 18"" flexible plastic wand with a long strip of colorful fleece attached to it. The fleece is slightly wider where it attaches to the wand and narrows down at the end to something resembling a tail. It will keep a cat entertained no doubt about it. But if you have the time, go down to the dollar store buy a kids cheap plastic wand, attach about 50 cents worth of fleece (approximately 2.5 feet) with electrical tape and you will have the exact same thing. My cat loves it and I am not going to waste my time shipping the stupid thing back.But I am willing to warn others about what a waste the thing is. Perhaps I will go into business selling these things myself, even at half the price I would still make a profit.",cats,2

"My dogs were trained to go on puppy pads from the moment they came home. I have standard and mini poodles. I bought hundreds of disposable puppy pads before I discovered the Pooch Pad. My dogs have a tendency to pee right on the edge of the disposable puppy pads, which creates a huge mess on the floor because the disposable pads aren't designed for dogs to pee on the edge. I bought a few Pooch Pads of various sizes hoping it would be the perfect solution. I was so glad I purchased them and wish I would have found Pooch Pads earlier. Now clean up is so much easier. I take the Pooch Pads outside, hose them off, and throw them in the washer. I have 2 sets, therefore Pooch Pads are always on the floor.",dogs,3
"This was a bit bigger than I'd thought, but that turned out to be a good thing. It fits well in the corner, and my cat really likes it (we recently took in another cat, so we got the older cat this box for herself). The ""greenery"" is a little cheesy, but I think it can be easily replaced, if I can find something nicer. I do agree that it might take a little while to get the hang of lining up the top and bottom so it stays together, but once you do, it's really a good sturdy litter box.",cats,2

"I bought one of these for my older, very large, and hard to impress cat. I couldn't believe his reaction. He immediately went for it. It can't be because of the catnip because he's never been intrigued by that before. I think it's the feathers although I also bought the squirrel (no feathers) which he also plays with. My 15 pound, 12 year old cat went berserk for this toy. He throws it in the air, chases it, and chews on it. I will buy more!!",cats,2
"I am new to planted tanks. This is my very first attempt. I had a goldfish (Gunsmoke) as a dorm pet in college and then some guppies. I recently got a betta (Rupert Pad Kee Mao) for my desk at work, but he will need a home in my home when I need to be out of the office for extended periods. So I started research to make him a vaca home that rules. I spottedCaribSea Eco-Complete 20-Pound Planted Aquarium, Black, just because I wanted black/natural substrate and started to read reviews. Honestly, they almost scared me away from this, but so happy I went with my gut. This stuff is amazing. Mind you I have a 5 gallon and it was daunting getting 20 lbs. of substrate. I worried that only using part would be a total mess. But guess what, it is fantastic. You are going to make a mess with any substrate, just head to your tub and work there.Placing into the tank it was NASTY! So nasty that I thought about all the reviews to rinse it, second guessing and extremely worried about double work. No worries though, seriously DO NOT RINSE this substrate and read the directions especially when adding to an established tank. My little tank was almost clear an hour after running the filter. By the next day the tank was crystal clear. Planting day (Red Cabomba, Water Sprite, Banana Plant, Bacopa and Java Moss) it was so clean (with a few floaties). Planting did kick up a bit, but not as much as I would have thought.It is now day four and the plants, even after all the stress I put them through, are thriving. I have not run chemistry on this tank yet, but will in a few days once it balances itself out (I don't want to freak myself into a tizzy looking at readings). I will probably get another tank (do not tell my husband) to use what is left. It looks fantastic, very natural with bits of rose and tan. I'll try to get back and update when Rupert moves into his penthouse in the next month.",fish aquatic pets,4

I have a yorkie, Tinker, that just stares at it. She just waits for someone to move it to dispense the food I've put inside. Is she that lazy? I know she is smart enough to figure it out. We were trying to show her how it works and now she just waits for us to show her again so the food will come out (perhaps that's the smarty pants coming out).

My little dachshund loves this rabbit! She hasn't figured out how to squeak it on her on yet but she seems to chew it to pieces but yet she hasn't chewed any part of it off as of yet. The squeaker is nice though when you want to get her attention especially when she starts chewing on something she's not supposed to chew on. It is very durable and very well-made. Definitely a high-quality dog toy. It's the perfect size for small dogs or large puppies. I would recommend this for anyone with a dog who enjoys chewing on stuffed animals.,dogs,3

My kitties really went crazy for these. I believe they use something similar to the bonito fish flakes in these. They also love bonito fish flakes so these were an easy sell. They come in cylinder shapes wrapped in the fish flake material. My cats loved to break them in half between their teeth. Not sure how well they clean the teeth but their teeth look pretty good after having these for a week. The only downside is that there are only 24 to a package and they didn't last long.

"I don't know if the collar I got is defective or what, but it really doesn't work. Followed the directions and it seems the little notches are out of sync. The name tag has fallen out every time I've put the collar on my pup (golden lab) and yeah. Really disappointed in this product. Fortunately, I didn't pay full price and it would cost as much to ship it back as to just use it as a dog toy -- which it now is.",dogs,3

"I bought this for my indoor/outdoor cat who doesn't always like to come inside for long periods. Overall it is a great product for cold nights & days... but a few things that should be noted.1. It comes with a cover, so there is no need to order one seperately.2. The first time I heated it up it only stayed hot for a few hours..but the more you use it the better it seems to work & stays warmer longer.3. 12 hrs. of heat is a bit of a stretch. I would say more likely 8-9 hours.4. Although it seems like it would be uncomfortable bc it is hard, my cat seems to be very comfortable when it is in his bed. He sleeps in his condo with it & seems very happy on cold days when he doesnt want to come in.Overall a great product that does not require electricity. Cat seems happy with it & that is all that matters.",cats,2
"Our five year old Havanese had plaque that was causing bad breath. We are now on day 7 of the 30 day treatment and I am amazed at the difference it has made in such a short time! His breath now smells like sweet puppy breath! He seems to like the flavor and doesn't protest too much during the brushing. I am grateful for the other reviews - my main reason for purchasing this particular brand. How nice to purchase a product that does what it claims! Petrodex rocks! Thanks, Amazon.",dogs,3

"On the plus side the sd-70 is small and inexpensive.The cd is also useful. Having two lengths of probes isgood.On the minus side it uses non-rechargeable batteries,the on/off switch on the receiver can be difficult to turnespecially when on the dog, the 200 feet range is minimalat best.Use it in the house or yard but 200 feet isn't very far if you'reon a trail or at the beach.The rectangular shape of the transmitter makes it easy topress the wrong button without looking at it to be sure.I also found level 3 not enough and level 4 too much soa few more levels would have been welcome.",dogs,3

"Be aware of sizing - I got the Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat, Medium, Black, and had a hard time deciding on the size. I have a Prius and it has bucket seats in the front and that's where I wanted to put my dog -- up close where I could pet her and we could have a decent conversation.My poodle is a 13 pound miniature and probably would have been okay with the small size, but I am so glad I got the medium size instead. Yes, it is too big. Yes, it compresses slightly when I close the passenger side door. But my dog loves it! She can stand up, change position, rest her head on the Snoozer walls, scrunch her head through the slot where the seatbelt fits, and just plain get comfortable. She loves looking out the car window and is safe and secure in her seatbelt. (I bought a harness to attach the Snoozer seatbelt strap to, so it's more comfortable.) The storage drawer is perfect for putting in extra stuff, but in a Prius, it's a tight fit. It works, just tight. Overall, I love it and it's worth it.Now we travel everywhere together!",dogs,3

It leaves my poodle's coat soft and smells WONDERFUL! I was impressed after reading the ingredients list. It uses only all-natural, high-quality ingredients. I will definitely keep buying Buddy Wash for my Bella. She is basically an indoor dog, but I bathe her once a week even if she's not dirty, just so I can enjoy that wonderful scent on her!",cats,2

"I was in line at Petsmart and the man in front of me was buying Bil Jac dog food. That was about 6 years ago. I asked him about it because I had never heard of it. He happened to be a Scientist who had been on a dog food study team and said it was the best of all they rated. I have 12 toy poodles ( I use to breed them) and this dog food they all loved immediately. The best part is it is the only small kibble I have found that isn't so hard. I have tried so many of the more expensive, better brands and they always turned their noses up at it, but would eventually, reluctantly, eat it. Bil Jac crumbles more easily for these little guys. For Picky eaters as well. It works well with dogs who have teeth problems and older dogs as well as it does not hurt their teeth to break the kibble. In a pinch I have had to buy other food for them and they never like it. The other kind I had to soak in water before feeding them because it was so hard. I promise your dogs will love this food and it's so good for them too. I have always let my dogs ""graze"" ( I am a big believer of that) and leave food down all the time and they never over eat with this or get fat. Normal BM's too. Can't say enough good stuff about this dog food. Once your dog gets a taste of this, they will never want another brand! Oh, it is for big dogs too!",dogs,3
"I have owned this product for about six months now and use it nearly every other day for both of my cats. This has made a noticeable difference in the amount of cat fur buildup on the carpet, bed, chairs, etc.When I first saw the product out of the package, I was a little worried about how fine the teeth were of this product. I thought it might just 'cut' the hair and make it look like it did a good job or be too rough for the cats, but they both love it and it really seems to do the trick. The back of the package that I purchased (at a local pet store) had a lady sitting next to two animals and ridiculous amounts of fur around her and the pets with ""One Sitting!"" proudly proclaimed next to the testers. I actually laughed at this and thought what a gimmick.After I used it I really do believe that if your cat or dog will sit there for 1/2 hour, you really could get all that out of them. I usually get my cats cornered for about 5 minutes or so and get around three large hand-fulls of fur every time I use it.I will be gifting this for my parents and my sisters this year. I love this product.",cats,2

This product is great. My papillon is trained on these pads. He is now 5 months old and is now ready to go outside. If I go away I put the pads in his pen. They are just great. He is a little fussy and doesn't like them to get too messy. So change them often.,dogs,3

"Purchased this gem in 09 and had little hopes after being duped before by those lovely infomercials.Truth be told, I only bought this because my sister had (and way overpaid for it at her vet), and she said it worked.It does work. It does pull out fur I was not getting with my other brushes, but I do feel it tugs a bit too much on the boys fur so I feel badly using it for too long. I don't know how the groomers do it. In 3 hours I pick up my dog, and he's like brand new. I could sit there all day with three different combs or brushes and have not nearly half the success.If this brush could do miracles I've be a happy camper, but for now I'm contented that I've gotten my money's worth and relieved perhaps a modicum of my boys itching! :D",cats,2
"When the box arrived I set it on the dining room table and my two cats were immediately trying to get into it. They were pawing at the box!

In isolated cases, there are times an antibiotic may need to be given for a severe skin infection along with the Happy Jack but it heals twice as fast with the Happy Jack.I actually had a Lab come and sit the first thing in the morning waiting to get the medicine on a bad case of skin infection.

"We have one grumpy older cat and a younger cat we got as a kitten (both indoor). The kitten has stayed in this every night for months without complaint. There is room for a litter box and bed still leaving an open space for a rug, food and water. This gives our older a cat a break from the younger one and keeps the younger one from waking us up at night. We do use an old plastic table cloth (water proof) under the entire enclosure for accidental spills and to catch the litter tracked out of the litter box. The mesh is strong and stands up to occasional clawing. The front flap opening is large enough to allow easy access to the litter box and can be kept in an open position by a velcro strap. The zipper is sturdy and with smooth movement.",dogs,3

We purchased this after a trainer suggested it to help train our misbehaving 16 month old pekingnese beagle (about 20 pounds). We have used this when working with him for a few weeks and the improvement is already evident. Just make sure to keep the collar on the dog when you are around the dog - training or not - so that the dog does not get collar smart (meaning that the dog will only behave when he has the collar on and not when the collar is off). The quick release is very easy to use and adjusting the collar was very simple. I was worried that I would have trouble adjusting the collar and I did it in a few minutes without any trouble. This is an excellent training tool.,dogs,3
"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for the strange can design -- a substantial amount of food sticks to the inside of the can and in the crevice under the top lip, long before the can is empty, and I have to use a baby food spatula to scrape this off.That being said, Cee Cee kitty devours this. It is not grain free -- as it does have Brown Rice in it (listed as the 8th ingredient, so it DOES have plenty of meat and fish protein), but the meat as well as the other ingredients more than make up for this. Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Formula with Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and Ocean Fish also smells very fresh and not garbagey like some of the supermarket cat foods. And since Cee Cee is battling hyperthryoidism as well as a heart murmur, I want to buy her the best food I can afford. This may be a bit pricey but it is VERY dense, so it goes a long way.",cats,2
"The product description really should specify the FORM of the medicine.

So, I don't know yet if the stuff works, or not!Another user review suggested dissolving the pellets in a 1/2 teaspoon it 1 teaspoon of water & draw that up into a syringe (w/o needle, of course) & squirting that into the car's mouth.

I have a 10 gallon tank and the purple one reaches to the top and a little more maybe an inch, but the remaining inch just kind of floats on top. So it looks very life like. The blue one...well wow looks so good! I would use this over and over and they are a good quality product.",fish aquatic pets,4
"My cat was extremely stressed and upset about me going back to work full time so took it upon himself to let me know that by peeing by our front door, therefore ruining our bamboo flooring.

Speaking of that squirmy 2 year old or at least the seemingly normal size one that lives with us anyway. They fit right through that pet door. And the little bugger figured out the pull mechanisim that keeps the pet door shut almost right away. On the bright side, it keeps the furry terror on its own side just fine so one more star for that. Overall an average product.",dogs,3

"Five cats = Littermaid Mega. I actually have two Megas because there is always an after breakfast and after dinner rush to use the Littermaid and the unit does have difficulty scooping two large litter clumps at the same time, it can be too heavy and sometimes will take several attempts to succesfully scoop the two large litter clumps. Also, when you have two cats jockeying to use the Littermaid at the same time, well I just had to get another to keep everyone happy! As other users state, do not overfill the pan. Also, line the plastic litter hoppers with grocery store bags and you can reuse, reuse, reuse, reuse them many, many times. When the plastic litter hoppers crack, I reinforce them with clear packing tape and further extend the use of each one. My cats all love their Littermaid Megas and we couldn't do without them. With five cats, I usually find myself emptying the hoppers every other day and doing periodic maintenance on the litterpan to keep it free of flat clumps that stick to the bottom of the pan.

"My dog only enjoys plush toys. If he is left alone for more than a few minutes with them, he'll begin to chew through his favorites! The previous football toy we had was more elongated, with sharper points at the ends of the ball which enabled him to easily chew the ends off. I've had to throw away several toys due to this problem. The PlanetDog football, however, is just enough more of an oval shape that it seems to not temp him with chewing off the ends. It's his favorite toy due to the crazy bounces it takes when you throw it. Highly recommended.",dogs,3
I wanted to coax our cat into sleeping somewhere other than our bed on cold nights. All it took was putting the bed near one of his usual nap spots and plugging it in. Now he won't leave it. Great bed for the money. highly recommend. Mini size is perfect for our fully grown cat.,cats,2

"This dog crate is perfect for my German Shepherd puppy who is now up to 50 pounds at close to 4 months of age. Having the removable divider has been helpful to keep him from using the bathroom in the crate. The quality of the crate seems to be very good.

I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to others looking for a large, durable crate.",dogs,3
"I have a 60 lb lab, who is a puller and has gone through about 5 leashes in 3 years. Her last leash was the medium Flexi retractable leash, which should be good for a dog up to 77 lbs. Other retractable leashes similar to the medium flexi snapped after only a few months of use. We used the flexi leash for well over a year before it started to fray slightly on the side. It is still very sturdy and we likely have months of use left in it (if not more), but I've gone ahead and replaced it with the large version for dogs up to 110 lbs. I would suggest going up a size if you have a dog closer to the upper end of the weight limit who is a puller, but still recommend this leash over any other leash we've tried.",dogs,3
"I was looking for the Rawhide Depot's usual 100 pig ears deal and was dissapointed that it wasn't available. I read the conflicting reviews on Rawhide Depot's cow ears - big, small, oily, not oily. I ordered the cow ears and was very pleased. They are very white (when you are used to pig ears), more elongated than pigs ears but at least the same surface area, and thinner than the pig ears. They were nice and dry - not oily at all. My dog likes the cow ears. She had to develop a different technique eating them - they don't shatter the same way the pig ears do. It takes her a little longer to chew than a pig ear. The price is right - it includes free shipping!",dogs,3

I decided to try this after being disappointed with other cat brushes. I just recieved it yesterday and my cat LOVED this grooming tool! Following the directions I used in a circular motion and he was immediately won over with the kitty massage. He followed me wanting me to continue to keep brushing him! The Kong captured the cat hair and was incredibly easy to clean - which was not the case for the other cat brushes I tried. The Kong will be very easy to disinfect if needed also.

"I love the brush and so do my dogs. One of my dogs is a Rough Collie mix and has a lot of fur that needs brushing. My other dog is a pure bred Sheltie (Shetland Sheepdog) and also has a lot of fur. The bristles on the brush are gentle enough not to hurt my babies, but hard enough to get out the tangles. My only complaint is that the bristle area is small and I have to pull hair out of the brush every 4 or 5 brush strokes. It could be because my dogs shed a lot, but isn't that what a brush is for? Otherwise, it's an excellent purchase and my dogs absolutely LOVE it.",dogs,3

Good quality ingredients for her, I received the case, the wrapping and box were in perfect shape, but 18 out of 24 cans were badly dented, not leaking, but I won't be feeding it to my cat in case the food is compromised, also the bottom of the cans were all dirty, which I found strange and wonder how that would occur.

The reason for switching over was to save on cost, my cat was going through them way too quickly so I thought this would be a smart way to resolve the issue. I was wrong. Now my floors are scratched up because I have had to move it, lift the top and scoop it myself. I realize this is my fault and it is certainly true what they say",cats,2

"**UPDATE November 2010** I decided not to give this toy to my shelties anymore because the kibble was getting lost in our deep pile brown carpet. My sister mentioned she was looking for a treat dispensing toy for her giant boy dog who weighs over 160 lbs. Since I had this Tricky Treat Ball sitting around, I gave it to her to see how her boy liked it. He's been playing with it for a year now, getting treats out by rolling it down his long front legs as he lays down. He also gives it a squishy chomp and drops it from his tall standing height to see if anything comes out. He loves it, he hasn't damaged it or tried to tear it in half to get the treats out (although he could if he tried!). I've increased the star rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. This toy is simply wonderful for my giant ""nephew"".My parents also were impressed by the tricky treat ball, so they got one for their little dog. Large size, but she can still roll it around with ease. She prefers to get her kibble out of this ball rather than a food dish (the food dish isn't exciting enough!). They first got the small size Tricky Treat ball for her, but it was small enough that it would roll underneath the couch where the dog couldn't get to it and my mom would have to fish it out for her. Keep that in mind when buying, if you have wood floors and your couches sit up a little from the floor, you should probably get the large size.-------------**Original Review**My dogs get kibble that's about 1/4"" in size. I wonder if larger kibble would be harder to get out of this toy? In any case, I'm not ready to switch kibble. I'm pleased with this toy but I do wish there was a way to adjust the size of the opening to slow the flow of kibbles, hence the docking of a star from the rating. I wrestled with whether to dock that one star, but I want you to know that this is still one of the best food dispensing toys out there! The fact there is no adjuster in the opening probably adds to the integrity of this ball.... we've had it for nearly 2 years without a scratch on it. If there was some sort of mechanism on this ball my boy sheltie would figure out how to break it, he's clever.My older sheltie girl doesn't get a lot of kibble at once, just a 1/4 cup, and she's able to empty this large Tricky Treat ball in about 5-7 minutes.Despite its large size, the dimples all over this ball allow my shelties (22 lbs and 30 lbs) to pick up the ball and carry it to where ever they prefer to roll it. The texture of this ball is slightly soft which my shelties appreciate (they HATE hard plastic). Both shelties quickly figured out that if they roll the ball with their noses kibble will magically appear under their noses. So, they've never tried to destroy this ball to get at the kibble.If your dog is similar to mine, you're likely to have a great experience with this treat ball too. If your dog is appropriately named ""T-Rex"" and can chomp down on a soccer ball with ease, I'm not so sure this Tricky Treat ball will last long for your dog. :)",dogs,3

"These ""shelves,"" as I call them, have been a very handy and welcome addition to my Quaker Parakeet's cage. My veterinarian recommended a product like this to aid with the arthritis in his legs and feet -- the premise being that having them at different levels within the cage allows him to be high as he desires without the fear of falling down easily. I have four of these interspersed throughout his cage, and he really enjoys making the rounds of them. They are simple and sturdy. I use basic cable ties to secure them to the side of the cage.",birds,0

My larger cat doesn't have room to turn around so he doesn't use it. The sifting equipment takes up quite a bit of space. My small regular kitty pan has more room than this thing.I used the World's Best Kitty Litter, but let me tell you, that stuff is not dustless and when you started turning this box and moving the litter to be sifted there is a ton of that corn dust in the air. I had to wear a dust mask. Also, it has come apart several times when I tilt it, leaving litter all over the floor.If it wasn't so freaking big I would send it back.",cats,2

I know a lot of people mentioned the loud nose however once I filled it up to the proper line with water the noise went away and just sounds like a trickle of water.My cat loves it, but he's the type that would only drink from sinks and would never ever drink from his dish so this was absolutely perfect for him. I haven't had any problems with the pump or the filter so far, so over all all thumbs up for me.",cats,2
"You need something like nylabones around to keep puppies from chewing up your house. This one is great for my chihuahua puppy. It's pink and cute and its also kind of rubbery soft. I had expected it to be really hard, so that was a nice surprise. She has regular bone shaped nylabones, and she enjoys this one being in the wishbone shape for something different to chew on. And really, for $2 you can't beat the price on here. I added it to my cart to help me get up to the $25 free shipping with a couple CD's I purchased. I would recommend this product and the other 2 items in the princess or prince series. I know the picture shows all three items, but they are sold separately and you need to add them all to your cart. I knew this, but apparently from reading other reviews, some people didn't.",dogs,3

"I love this collar, I also have a bigger size for one of my other dogs. It's a great color, and the martingale is perfect. I like having the added control when walking that the maringale provides, but also know the amount of tightening is restricted so it won't cause any damage to my pet's windpipe like traditional slip leads/choke collars. The ONLY thing that would make this collar better would be a clip for easy on/off and emergencies. Overall",dogs,3

"We are on our third large ""Canine Cooler"" bed and HIGHLY recommend this product for non-chewing hot dogs.We first bought one for our long-haired Belgian Shepherd, who ultimately reached 130lbs. He spent every night of his life going between his ""hot bed"" (a typical foam bed) and his ""cool bed."" Over the course of seven years, we only replaced the Canine Cooler once because the inner sponge has broken into pieces after years of use.Our even-hotter Newfy puppy inherited the used Canine Cooler bed, but chewed on the corner. We taped it up with duct tape, but once he was six months old, we got him a new one and he now spends his nights going between his softer Canine Cooler cool bed and his harder - but even cooler - marble slab. (Yes, he has several big soft dog beds, but he finds them too hot to lay on for more than a minute or two unless he's wet from a bath or swim.)Like the advertizing says, the Canine Cooler isn't cold, but it is cool and amazingly stays cool when a warm body lays on it. They sell covers for it, but we never use anything over it because it reduces the cool effect that our dogs really need. It's well worth the cost for a hot dog.",dogs,3

It would go on intermittently for hours if we did not get up, UGH!We tried many things including squirt bottle, feeding her early if we happen to get up before her,or quaranting her in the closet for an hour or two (in another room until we got up).Didn't have the room for two automatic feeders (live in apt. with two cats) and that probablywouldn't have stopped her!My vet recommended putting a vacuum by the door (to scare her) and turning it on when she was boxing the door(wasn't too keen on that idea)!Discovered and received the ScatMat last week, threw in a 9v battery, and placed in front of bedroom door. Voila!!Life is good!On top of this.... she no longer screams at us in the morning begging for food!I think she really gets it! She has been defeated!She had to step on the mat the first two nights to test it out, but that did the trick!She now waits quietly on the couch with miss manners our other kitty every morning.Naughty cat no longer trains us....... we have trained her!Don't get me wrong...... we loooove our cats, but now we can love them much more with good sleep!",dogs,3

It works very dependably and gives me the flexibility to not have to come home at a certain time or wake up at a certain time each day to feed my cat.

Well, it works very well as my cat hasn't figured out how to escape and probably never will; the door requires someone with an opposing thumb to work the latch. Cats aren't that smart, you could probably even leave a number of small levers inside with the cat and it still couldn't get this open. The carrier is lightweight and comes in 2 halves that fit together, so don't be surprised by the small size of the shipper; it's easy to put together and if you ever need to clean it, it's easy to disassemble and hose or scrub clean.

It is quite large, as others have said, and you do have to have about five feet available to do the rolling, but other than that, it's a bargain.",cats,2

"When I ordered these steps I was a little worried that it wouldn't be sturdy enough or that since the steps weren't completely covered in cloth that it may be a little slippery for my jack russell terrier. I didn't want to have to pay well over a hundred dollars for one of those solid wood ones, and as it turned out I didn't have to. This thing is perfect for what I (and my dog) need. It's very sturdy, could probably hold a MUCH heavier dog with no problems. The steps are covered enough that the non-covered areas are of no concern whatsoever. It took a couple days for my dog to get used to them, now she has even started using them to get off the bed as well.As an added bonus, since this item was over $25 I chose the free shipping option, figuring it would take 2 weeks to get here. It showed up 4 days later!

"This cage is far too small for a guinea pig to live in full time. Guinea pigs living in this cage are basically living in a litter box. They need room to walk, play, and ""popcorn"" or they become very unhealthy very quickly.

Next time you see a guinea pig in a cage of this type, look at their attitude. I never knew that guinea pigs were happy little creatures until I found out that they sell cages that are too small to you at the pet store. Every guinea pig I'd ever seen were depressed, and sad little animals.Now I know why, so I'm trying to warn others.I also have a big problem with the latch, the door is TOO small to try to get things in and out, the handles hurt your hands, and the stuff that was included in the ""kit"" that came with my cage were completely inappropriate for guinea pigs -salt lick, sugar treats etc. I didn't know any of this at the time.Please take the time to research about guinea pigs before you purchase anything for your piggies.I'm giving it one star, because the one positive thing is that it doesn't have a wire floor...a deadly thing for Guinea pigs.",small animals,5
"This is just okay. I have begun to loathe the ladder. Fish keep getting stuck, and it won't be long before I find someone dead. I have switched out the ladder for an air stone.Instead of buying the refills that Hagen sells, I started using my own recipe. I follow the normal directions (fill sugar to the first line, fill lukewarm water to the second) and use 1/4 tsp of bread maker's yeast. For $8 you can get a jar of yeast that will last you forever. (just make sure to check the expiration date on the yeast, and maybe start a bread-making hobby just in case) Some people also add baking soda to counter the production of alcohol, which lowers the pH and eventually drowns the yeast, but I have not yet figured out the right amount. This will last about 2-3 weeks, depending.Injecting CO2 caused my extremely soft water to become extremely acidic water, but after I fixed my kH problems, everything works fine. I used baking soda to increase kH without altering the gH.PROS",fish aquatic pets,4

"I saw this in my Gold Box last night and read some of the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I went to Petco and got one today and I am amazed at how well it works! I have two cats, one with a very thick thick coat, and one cat that has a normal coat. When I brush them with my regular brush I get about 3 times more hair from the one with the thick coat. When I used this brush I got about the same amount from both. The hair was literally falling out in clumps! After only a few swipes with the FURminator their coats were soft and silky. Also, one of my cats hates being brushed but he was purring as soon as I stared and followed me around when I stopped.Using this brush for 30 seconds made a believer out of me. I can't understand the people who said this brush didn't work - this brush is truly amazing. I would recommended it to anyone with animals.Now all I need is a vacuum that picks up cat hair with one swipe...",cats,2

"Tetra Whisper Air Pump 40 Gal TankFor the money this is a good little air pump. Although I do have to say that after around the 4 month mark like everyone else giving a review here it got very noisy.Don't worry there is a fix! Unscrew the 4 Philips head screws under the unit and separate the bottom and the top. You will find a stack of ""L"" shaped magnets. Move the stack a bit to the right and tighten the nut that holds the ""L"" shaped magnets in place. Put it back together and ta-da no more noise! The Problem is that the little arm that holds the square shaped magnet is hitting the ""L"" shaped magnets with every pump. All you have to do is give it some space so it doesn't hit the other stack of magnets. The nut might not have be tight enough when they built it or it rattled loose during normal use allowing the stack of magnets to slip a bit.All in all this is a pretty good pump.

"Better in than some, worse than others. The dial allows you to set the temperature and is good at keeping the temp. consistent which is great. However, aside from the actual heating is the construction. Because of its shape it will not work for a anything smaller than a 2.5 Mini Bow or for tanks w/o straight sides.This is not because you can't control the temp. finely enough, but because the large mounting piece needs to be above water, outside of the tank and attached to a straight edge. While the package does say non-submersible, I didn't think there would be so much of it that wasn't submersible, and the thumbnail for this isn't helpful at all. The water line is also very high. You will have to keep a careful eye on evaporation.Also, when the water temp. is close enough to cause the heater to shut off, there is a period of hesitation where the heater is almost on but not quite. When this happens, there is a buzzing sound. It reminds me of old horror movies when the characters turn on the bare bulb in the basement or in the defunct asylum.",fish aquatic pets,4

"I have a cattle dog who is well behaved on community dog-walks, but is territorial about the home and yard. She will bark and act ""manic"" if any of the neighbors' dogs bark or are outside. She will not listen when in that state of mind.Before I used this collar on her, I rubbed the prongs on the counter top to activate it then applied it to back of my hand. Not too much of a shock.The first time I put the collar on her, she went crazy over the dog next door. After a few barks, the collar gave her a jolt. She yipped and ran to me. It took a few zaps for her to get the idea she couldn't bark incessantly. Eventually, the little stinker figured out it would reset if she was quiet for a few minutes. She would give out a quiet bark and run to me.Now all I have to do is carry the collar. When she starts to bark, I give the collar a shake. She hears the clinking of the buckle and quiets down.It is not meant to be put on a dog that is going to be left unattended. It's a training aid.",dogs,3

We had bought cheaper clippers from our local big-box store and it just didn't work the way we needed it to. These worked better than the cheaper ones we had purchased but it was still tough getting through some of her mats. This doesn't mean that the clippers are the culprit, it was tough trimming the mats down with scissors designed for cutting hair (sharper that most standard scissors), so it may just be that she has fur that resists being trimmed when matted regardless of what is used.Overall, I think these are good clippers, and the price on Amazon was cheaper than any other site I had seen and much cheaper than buying one from our local pet store. I would say this was a good purchase.",cats,2

"I have owned 2 littermaids. The second bigger unit, being the noisiest. Littermaid was ahead of its time when it 1st came out, but they have done nothing to improve upon it. I have 1 bengal cat, and would have to empty the container at least every 3 days. The lids never fit tight, and they way the lid attaches, the cat would step on it and cause lid to become unattached. The megamaid was better in that the cat was more comfortable, not being confined to a short container. The main problem, is, that the litter gets in the gear tracks so easily. I was having to clean out the drive tracks everyday. Hey the idea of an automated litter box, is, so you don't have to clean it so often, but the upkeep to keep it operating properly is more than daily scooping. My cat lives in my bedroom with me, and the unit is soo noisey that when it starts it wakes me up at night. The cover is a joke, so much litter gets in it that you are continually having to pull the litter maid out to clean the cover, and the cat loves to get on top of it, which breaks the cheap plastic frame..When it first came out, it was more of a novelty item, I like gadgets. My cat likes gadgets too, and he gets in it, I believe, just to activate it and watch the rake go thru the litter. The unit start about 10 minutes after Gizmo, gets out of it, which is not really enough time for the poop or pee to solidify, thus it gets stuck in the rake. The containers that hold the poop, don't fit together well, and if I didn't have an ionizer in the room, I would have gotten rid of the littermaid alot sooner. I threw the unit in trash today and have gone back to a regular tray. Gizmo was watching me the whole time and when, I filled it with litter and put cover on it, he was waiting, impatiently for me to finish, and went right in, and did his business. He will stay in box for 10 minutes after, scratching the sides, covering up, over and over his poop.. In the littermaid, this meant that alot of it ended up outside the box, and in the tracks that the rake have to travel in, gumming up the unit.. The littermaid is a good unit if you keep up with it daily, but, Hey, who am I, I thought the idea was not have to do daily cleanings. I can't imagine if I had more then 1 cat.",dogs,3
"My wife's long hair always gets caught up in our vacuum's brush roll. This thing definitely helps with that.

"I read the reviews on this litter box and had a lot of hope for it. But, I have to say I agree with everyone who's saying they don't know why so many people rate this with so many stars. Four? Five stars? Not even close. The following are my primary issues:1. The rolling process takes up more floor space--yes, that should have been obvious to me--so by the time you pull out the box from it's location and roll it, you've spread the debris area2. There wasn't a fill line the first time I filled it up, so I overfilled and it wouldn't work--the instructions didn't make that clear3. When you overfill it, there is no easy way to get the litter back out without taking the top off, which makes the screen pop out, which makes it a pain to find the tabs to put the screen back in when it's full of litter4. The screen pops out all the time--even with the lid secured (see note 3 for what a pain it is)5. The rolling process invariably dumps litter on the floor; when it works, not often correctly, I save time cleaning the litter box, but now I have to vacuum after so the net time savings is 0.6. I have two cats, and even though I empty the box every day, sometimes the clumps are so large that they scrape across the opening when you're pulling the drawer out--uhhhh, disgusting.Great idea, and I'd love to have this nasty chore simplified, but I'm going back to the old standard.",cats,2

"This is wonderful stuff for us. We MUST have a cat litter that is safe for dogs to eat, since regardless of what we do, our dogs find a way to eat some of it. At the same time, clumping litter is so much more convenient. So that leaves this corn litter and the wheat kind. The wheat-based brand gives off LOTS of dust, about 50 times the dust that this one does. Not exagerating. Our cat thought nothing of the change to this one and uses it just fine. It does control the odor far better than other varieties (I have been foster mom to 50 cats over the years, and I have tried every litter including clay, pine, newspaper, and wheat). This one is the best by far. That said, if your cat will not use it, it is worthless to you! So you may want to try the small bag first.",cats,2

"My twelve year old short hair tortie was dying. I'd taken her to the the top vets in the city. Nobody could figure out what was wrong. She was losing all her hair on her belly, from neck to feet. She was losing weight. She stopped eating. They found nothing wrong with her digestive system except that her intestines were ""ropey"", whatever that means. Her bloodwork was all normal. I tried allergy diets. I tried allergy shots. Nothing. On a hunch, I changed her litter to Nature's Miracle (had been using one of the top clay clumping formulas for twelve years). Well, it didn't take long. After a month, she began to recover. She is now back to normal weight, fur has regrown after two years of baldness, she's happy and frisky and eating everything (no allergies). I think the clay litter was irritating her skin, she was licking it and ingesting the clay, which was slowly poisoning her.

"we have owned other self-watering bowls in the past but this is the best one yet! i thought my cat wouldn't like the noise, just a little more than the last, but she loves it!! it is a little more involved to clean [take apart] but it is still worth the money! thank you!",cats,2
"This stuff really works! The trick is that you really have to saturate the spot, which does make it a bit more costly than you might originally think. I would guess that one bottle only cleans 5-10 accidents, depending on the amount of urine. But. . . that said, it is still way worth the money!I have used it on dog urine and kid urine (POTTY TRAINING SUCKS!!!) and it has always worked for me. My daughter had accidents constantly and she would stand and just let the pee run down her legs into the carpet. I have never smelled urine in her room since using this product!Again, though, I stress that the trick is to really, really saturate the area and then just let it air dry. I soak up as much of the urine first with paper towels (just put them down on the ground and step on them and you will be amazed how much liquid it will pick up) and then apply the kids n pets.",cats,2

"This litter box is an excellent idea! We were faced with the problem of where to relocate our cat's litter box and the only place we could put it was in our family room. To put a conventional litter box there would have not been desirable. I found this hidden litter box that looks like a large plant and no one is the wiser! Our cat took to it right away and we haven't had a problem with it. We just put it in the corner with the opening facing the corner. I highly recommend this. Although I felt it was a little pricey, it's worth it to avoid having to look an unattractive litter box. Now we have a litter box that doesn't look like a litter box and the plant and pot fit in nicely with our decor!",cats,2
"I've bought many cat trees over the years, and this one has to be the worst I've ever seen! The wood shelves are about half the thickness of our other cat trees, and the ""fur"" is about 1/16"" thick. The shelves are the same size, which makes it difficult for our cats to get from one shelf to the next higher one! At $60, it was less than what we've paid in the past, and this is a case of you get what you pay for. The trouble is, it weighs so much that it wouldn't be practical for us to try and return it. So, we are s-t-u-c-k. Some things you shouldn't try to order online, you have to be able to see it in person in order to tell it the quality is there or not. And for this one, I assure you, it is NOT.",cats,2

Most cats like height & don't like sleeping on beds on the floor & even when they age, this doesn't change.

"I had one of the original dog doors from before this company changed hands, it was solid grey, with no window. They were robust, and still work beautifully.I bought another one for a dog house, brown with plexiglass inner door, a few years ago, and it wasn't as good as the original grey one. Lighter weight, and didn't seem to seal as well.This is my third one - building a dog door for my patio slider. The basics are still there - but much more flimsy then the brown one. I'll use it, but its just sad that the quality isn't what it used to be. I'd pay more for better quality.",cats,2
"I've really enjoyed our Drinkwell, but our cats have liked it even more. We introduced it and they completely stopped drinking from all of their other water dishes. One cat even started taking her naps while curled up against the fountain.That said, an important thing to know is that you can wash almost the entire fountain in your dishwasher. Just remove the motor with a simple twist, and then everything that's left can be put in the dishwasher. Their website recommends using the top rack. Also, if you bought the extra reservoir add-on, they say that should only be hand-washed.",cats,2
I ordered these for my fox terriers in the size recommended and they fit well AFTER I made additional holes in the strap so it was tight enough ( I needed a hole at least 2 inches from where the manufacturer's hole stopped) and the basket tends to rub the hair off the dog's muzzle so I glued sheepskin to nose bridge - it helps some. I also attached the muzzle to a buckle collar as my dogs are able to remove the muzzle when it's on by itself. This sounds like alot of complaints but compared to other basket muzzles this is a good one. And my dogs are much happier in them than the canvas muzzles.,dogs,3

"I do not normally take the time to write a review. Seeing that this product had an average rating of 3 stars, I had to say something. This product is amazing. Maybe the quality of the product varies by unit or vendor. If this is the case, that is unfortunate. However, I purchased mine at a local pet store. I LOVE IT! So much that when it went on sale I went to buy a spare to have just in case! (they were sold out).- I have to change the plastic bag every other day- I add liter 1-2 times per week.- You can use any clumping liter you want! So no added expenses or weird over-priced liter- no filters to change- no pads to change out!I have two cats and they took a couple days to get use to it. I took the advice of the company and let them get use to it with the motor off. They do not hesitate now!I will be honest, I was really bad at cleaning the liter box before simply clean. On occasion, the girls would have an accident right out side of the house. They have not had one accident since I bought the unit.Bottom line, if it broke tomorrow, I would absolutely without hesitation buy a new one!",cats,2

He does love to play with little furry mice though. He can bat those things around for hours. Oh, and don't even get me started on Da Bird.

This round has lasted almost 2 months, and I was hopeful because I'd advanced to having 3 rings gone, but it ended before sunrise this morning with a big pile of smelliness in the center of my bed, some little spots on the carpet, and my ""dry clean only"" comforter in the washer with some bleach.

"Yes folks, I too was one of the desperate owners of 3 burly cats that seemed to make a living of turning my house into one giant stomping grounds for their deficating fancies.....So, in search of the perfect solution to a self manageable litter box, I turned to Littermaid in hopes of it being my salvation.Let's cut to the chase here.....I have one Main Coone ( a big goofy beast ) and 2 standard sized cats. In theory the design is brilliant and even in it's defense, when it works, which is occassionaly, it's a pleasure. In fact, you'll actually find yourself watching several clean up 'transactions' rooting...yes cheering the system on as the rakes chugs its way toward the receptical...hoping, praying it completes it's journey successfully which would strangely give you sense of calming closure to your purchase. Dont laff.....you know you all have done this too!Well, unfortunately.....the system doesnt always work as designed...The rake motor is extremely weak and will choke on even the most miniscule of droppings....There was also a time in which I got poked in the eye with a flying piece of dung that was sprung in the air from the rake that eventually wrestled itself free!....I guess I deserved it anyways for observing too closely anyways. For my 3 cats, the plastic trash/poo receptical actually fills up completely by the end of each day....i kid you not. So it's either replace it daily or empty, rinse and replace each morning. And dont even think about putting even a tad bit more litter in the box then the LINE indicates or you'll wind up having to just empty it out anways to get the rake to complete it's cycle.Like I said earlier, the design is brilliant and if it worked more smoothly, it would be a fantastic product......My suggestion to LitterMaid is a simple one that would immensely improve this product...BUILD A STRONGER RAKE MOTOR! Dont worry...no one is gonna lose a limb in thier!As it stands now, the LitterMaid actually seems to be more work than just using my old litter box which I could simply change once a week!....This thing is going back to Target once I have used my final plastic WASTE TRAY! ;) You've been warned....I was optimistic for this to be the answer!",cats,2

We then stopped the Duralactin thinking that it wasn't doing anything, but she again digressed.

"I bought these for my senior dog. She has a tumor on the bottom of one foot that blisters and bleeds easily. I was putting socks on her, but they didn't provide traction. These Muttluks help her stay upright without pain to her foot, or agitation to her wound. She likes to stay outside longer and they stay on! These are durable, easy for her to walk in, and they are breathable! As a result, her chronic wound is finally starting to heal nicely. These have rubber on the toe, and a thick suede (or suede-like) pad on the bottom. The yellow material is like a lightweight jacket material. The top is like a soft folded cuff that you might find on a thick sweater. The velcro strip does not cut off circulation or cause swelling. They do indeed come in a pack of 4 and they do seem washable. These WILL be a blessing when it snows! Though a bit pricey, I would buy these again.By the way, if you are searching around for comparisons, the flat u-shaped ""Paw Tectors"" brand paw protector/dog boots don't stay on. They are very stiff, just as their picture suggests (if you've seen them online). Although they are waterproof and completely durable, they don't bend, conform or fasten snugly enough for them to be walked in, nor will they stay on if your pooch steps in mud. If boots are a must for your dog, Muttlucks should work the best.",dogs,3

Still, best thing I've never used on war against cat hair!",cats,2
"I had the older version for years and it worked quite well considering the cat usage. Then I made the horrible mistake of getting another one and boy is this model a dog! The metal tines are too far apart to rake much of anything into the tray. I tried several types of litter even the Littermaid litter and most of the time all I got was a pile of smelly poo and litter just before the tray and not in the tray. The cats still preferred the older model and used it more often. But alas, I moved and the older model was so worn after years of loyal service that both boxes were tossed in the move.I'm going to go back to the older version. Do not buy this one.",cats,2
"I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review. I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all. The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown. The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it. A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly. I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken! I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better. My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one. He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly. The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon. In the future, I will only buy this from amazon. It is the exact same thing for almost half the price! Way to go Amazon, this is great.I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated. 5 stars.",dogs,3

My dog got used to the different pulling sensation with only minimal fighting. Now she walks perfectly calm right with us. The training effect of the head collar is so great that we can even put the head collar on, but attach the leash to her normal collar and she still does not pull!

"My dog, little Bichon, has had back problems (even paralyzed a few months ago)...mostly from being stepped on by her 120-pound roommate (canine), and her knees were bad because these dogs like to jump up on furniture--wherever you are actually...and they're cute so you let them. After she recovered from paralysis, she had another injury and this doctor recommended Vetri-Disc (along with the acupuncture). She has recovered and is spunkier than she has been for a long time (she just had her 11th birthday). She doesn't wait for me to help her up the stairs or get in bed. She does it herself...and her coat, which had been getting thin, is growing in well. She's stronger and you can just tell she feels better because of it.",dogs,3
"I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up.",dogs,3
"I love the Drinkwell, however, the pump is a major pain to remove and clean every week. Your hands can't reach around it to pull it out sufficiently, and then putting it back in is just as painful. It was easy the first two or three times, but I've owned mine for about a year now and can't even get the pump out any more its so difficult. For a little while I stopped trying to remove it and just tried to clean it well with it in there, but after a month I managed to get it out and it was filthy with mold, so it absolutely has to be removed for cleaning. Because of this major issue I will be trying out other fountains, because it is just too difficult to get it out. Otherwise I love it, its not loud, it keeps the water fresh and clean, and my cats love it! If they fixed this issue I would be ecstatic!",cats,2

"Used K9 Advantix believing it to be top of the line. After one dose, my dog became extremely hyper - kept running in circles. He'd stare blankly and started crying. He started to vomit, bright red blood was coming from his rectum. He was bouncing off walls, running into objects, moaning strangely, and got very paranoid. He had a very difficult time breathing, rising body temperature and, lastly, lost the use of his hind legs as he was dragging them behind him in total panic. All of these symptoms manifest within 4 hours. We called our vet who wanted to see him immediately. They were prepared with IV meds, took blood tests, ordered x-rays and used scanning equipment because they HAD treated this before. Outcome was not promising. After two days in the hospital, we brought our baby home. What was the cause? Bayer's K9 Advantix - the medication with the highest concentrate of Permethrin. Our dog had succumb to Permethrin Poisoning. More common than you know. I've run the gamut of every agency I knew, filed reports and complaints, but this appears to be a very hush-hush deal. I asked my vet, who has treated other dogs with similar reactions to Permethrin in K9 Advantix, exactly what he has seen for symptoms and outcomes. He replied everything from organ failure to permanent paralysis to death. My vet's office does not recommend K9 Advantix to any pet owner as they've seen, first hand, the pain and suffering a dose of K9 Advantix can have on a pet. Don't kid yourself, you can use K9 Advantix for a year with absolutely no side effects, but it takes just one time for your pet to react adversely and have to go through what we did. Permethrin is a very potent poison used to kill hearty weeds. Bottom line, Bayer produces a ""medication"" that contains high levels of a toxic poison. Does anyone see how ""sick"" this situation is???? There is an on-line blog called [...]where you can read through 15 pages of actual testimonials from pet owners who have had to deal with the complications caused by Bayer's K9 Advantix. I pray you don't ever experience what our family did, nor any of the families who have lost their precious pets to K9 Advantix - God Bless you All!",dogs,3

I got a stray from a animal shelter and it was apparent that walking on a leash was not going to be a fun thing. The gentle leader has saved his neck. he kept pulling for a long time with a regular collar and choking but the gentle leader stopped that almost instantly. Watch the video on how to adjust it. That makes a big difference and watch some youtube videos about how to get them to want to put it on.,dogs,3

"This was a great product when it was working. It was nice to pick up our macaw and her feet would be warm. It appeared she liked the perch because she stood on it even though she had other places to perch. It lasted one winter, maybe two. The other day I noticed it was loose. When I tried to tighten it, the wire twisted off. It is now junk. I suppose I am purchasing another for poor Goober simply because I cant find a better one, although there is obviously a design flaw. (the threaded area is weak). This time I will build a brace to support the outer end.",birds,0

My 10 year old Springer Spaniel began noticeably limping. After X-Rays it turned out she had arthritis in her knee. Of course the Vet recommended surgury which we were not too kean on. She then recommended Cosequin DS which they sold. Unfortunately they wanted about $200 per bottle. After doing some research on the product itself and then searching I found it here for significantly cheaper $64. That's about .25 cents per dose. The bottom line is that her limp totally stopped within a week and can once again jump up and down from the couch (spoiled rotten) and bed. 60 some dollars every eight months is well worth it.,cats,2
Our 15 pound dog was not able to get the squeaker to make noise becuase of the force required. The sqeaker was useful in getting our dog excited when we squeazed the ball before throwing it however the ball stopped squeaking after a couple of days. Now it's just a tennis ball.,dogs,3

"After finding out at a friend's house that our pup loves laser pointers, I picked up one of these laser pet toys at a pet store nearby.BUILD QUALITYWell, for the four or so bucks, I wasn't expecting much. The build quality is typical of cheap Chinese laser pointers, and should not be purchased with the intention of using it much more than six months or so. The button mechanism is definitely a weak point, although I believe that constant switch lasers have to fall under a different category, hence why they are not used in cheap pointers such as this.PERFORMANCEI find the laser to be bright and relatively powerful. The patterns are nice, but I rarely use them to be honest. So far the batteries have performed as expected, although they are cheap enough to be replaced and are stocked both on Amazon, and at most places such as Walgreens and CVS.OVERALLSeeing how much our dog loves chasing this thing has led me to research some more durable solutions, particularly the well-reviewed QQ-Tech Green Red Blue / Violet / Purple Beam Laser Pointer Combo 3 Laser Light Pens. This Ethical Pet Spotbrites laser pointer is a true 4-star product - I like it because it is cheap and it works, however it lost a star for construction quality (or lack thereof) and for what I know will be a short life. Recommended for those not wanting to spent $30 on a laser pointer that their pet may not appreciate.",cats,2

"When first seeing the price of this item, I balked. Since it had a money back guarantee, I figured I had nothing to lose by trying. Turns out this is the best $250 I've ever spent. It does everything it says it is going to do. I have three cats, and instead of two old fashioned stinky litter boxes, I now just use the one litter robot. I clean it once per week. Wow! It took our cats about a week to fully transition. We left the old boxes next to it, as the manufactor recommends. Even our finicky, funny old rex cat came around, and I was worried she wouldn't. A little cat nip (provided) helped with that. This makes life so much easier and tidier, and I love hearing the sound of it come on automatically. I feel cleaner; the box is cleaner; the dogs can no longer raid the cat box for kitty-roca treats. By the way, I bought a reconditioned unit for less money. It has the same guarantee as a new one, so why not?Catherine",cats,2

After a few weeks of daily use, it is still stiff enough that ones the dog tugs so that the collar tightens, it will not release again. The color in the photo is a bit deceiving. The collar is a bright fuchsia leaning toward pink, with plum colored flowers. If I had realized just how very PINK this was, I would have selected a different color and style.",dogs,3

"I've had my two Scoop Free litter boxes for three months. They're the best thing that's ever happened. They really work. I bought them after researching all the ones on the market. There is no odor and no mess. Since I have my apartment on the market, this is essential. I change the cartridges every two weeks (and have two boxes) because I have two large cats (18 and 14 pounds and a smaller 6-pounder). The cats adapted immediately. The little one (a very active 18-month-old) is fascinated. He hops in and out frequently to watch them work, so they also serve as an entertainment center for a rambunctious teen-ager. I wish they had been available years ago, after 30 years as an indoor-cat owner",cats,2

So tight he could hardly breathe.I tried again, thinking it was me. I triple checked that it was not too tight just definately not loose enough for that to happen again.I found him with the bottom half in his mouth. He had been chewing at it trying to get out.Seems like a great product. Please be extremely careful.

"I bought this cat furniture and it was delivered with no issues. The first problem I had was setting it up. One of the bolt anchors in the base was deformed and would not accept a bolt. I called General Cage and got them to ship me a new anchor. They were very pleasant and helpful on the phone, and the parts cam promptly.The next issue was the the instructions for attaching the caged ball on top of the structure are wrong. It tells you to use a short bolt instead of a long bolt to attach it to the post below. Well, the short bolt doesn't fit. This wouldn't be much of a problem except that they don't include any spare parts, so I had to call General Cage again. They were helpful again, and agreed that the instructions for the product are crappy. (They do not manufacture the product, they simply import it)The furniture itself is nice looking, though I wish the tent in the middle were a solid house rather than a fabric tent. I don't think it'll take too long for my cat to claw it to shreds. It's not very stable, when my cat's on the top perch it wobbles a lot. It doesn't seem like it'll actually tip over, and he's already jumped from a table directly onto the top perch, but he looks like he's in an earthquake when he's up there. It doesn't seem to bother him that much though, so I may just add a board under the base to give it some more stability. He loves the furry balls, which is amazing since catnip does absolutely nothing for him. The scratching posts are nice too, and allows him to fully stretch out. Finally, the platforms do offer him enough room to lay down on - though they would be a little small for a 15 - 20 pound cat.I bought it for $80, I wouldn't pay more than that for it, and it's simply the hassle of returning it and trying something else sight unseen that keeps me from sending it back. My cat uses it, it's tall, and the platforms are large enough, and in Hawaii there aren't enough local choices to compare.",cats,2

"I've been using the Cat-it Fountain for nearly two years and find it to be a terrific product. I keep it off the floor, on a table where one of my two cats is fed, which does help to keep it cleaner longer. After a brief period of adjustment, both of my cats love it, especially my tortie, Gracie O'Malley, who has always insisted on drinking from a dripping sink faucet. I had to adjust to it, too, but well worth it. In the early days I did occasionally have trouble getting water to flow properly over the dome. I ultimately found a great workaround. After cleaning, fill some of the reservoir before replacing the dome and be sure the dome is well seated. Insert the plug in an outlet, and as the water starts to bubble over onto the dome, sometimes unevenly, take a glass or two of filtered water and ""tease"" the water flow by slowly pouring it all around the dome. No need for rubbing the dome if you do this, no wrinkled fingers! I didn't realize at first that the entire aparatus comes apart, much easier to clean when disassembled. It takes me about 10-15 minutes to clean it, which I do every two weeks, and I don't mind at all because I see that my cats drink a lot more often with this fountain. I once lost the spring when it flew off and went right down the drain. Phoned the company and they were wonderful to deal with. Highly recommended!",cats,2

I am happy to have two mats and would recommend this product as especially good for older cats that need a little extra TLC.",cats,2
"I had used Frontline flea control effectively for many years until we noticed last summer that our dog was scratching all the time. Someone suggested that we might have purchased a bad batch of frontline and so we bought another package but still he was scratching. We were applying the Frontline faithfully on schedule but still scratching. Our level of frustration grew until we thought he might be suffering from allergies or mites. After trying many other (expensive) treatments, he was still scratching so bad that we had resorted to putting dog clothing on him to protect his skin. Finally in desperation, I was scouring the internet for solutions and read an article about flea control becoming ineffective. Many people were commenting that Frontline was no longer working for their pets but that Advantix was. I purchased the Advantix and 6 weeks later, my dog was completely scratch free. I know it sounds dramatic but this restored sanity to our whole household and needless to say our poor pet is now out of pain and torment. Plus we no longer need to question whether he has allergies or mites. It was fleas all along - but they were not obviously visible.",dogs,3

"In many ways, this product saved my sanity. My cat, who was abandoned, was absolutely obsessed with food when he came to live with me - he wanted it early, often, and was angry when he didn't receive it. He rapidly went from underweight to overweight, and we were both miserable. Enter the autopetfeeder - he is now a stable weight and a loving cat. It reliably dispenses a very precise amount of food. (I've read the reviews and wonder if some of the owners who have trouble with the amount are feeding their pets food that isn't the right size for this machine.)If your cat is smart, as is mine, he will eventually figure out how to stick his paw in and draw out a few pieces of food. Rest assured, this doesn't cause overeating; they can only access the few pieces at the bottom of the auger. So let them. They can also wiggle the machine to shake those pieces out - I solved that by affixing mine to the floor.My only complaint is that the nozzle that covers the opening is an unreliable plastic. Granted, it had a 12-pound cat pawing at it; but mine broke completely within 10 months. The plastic funnel - it's been redesigned since the picture on this site-- broke completely from left to right. Since I was past the 6 month mark, the seller did not have any obligation to fix the product (although under warranty) - nor did they even have the courtesy of responding to my email. Amazon responded, but did nothing to resolve the issue. Luckily, the manufacturer was more responsive.All things considered, I think this product has some design flaws - shouldn't it be built to withstand a curious cat? - but I would buy it again for the security it's given me over the past year.",cats,2

"I purchased two of these vests for my dogs, so that they would stand out to any potential hunters at the farm where they run. First off, I found the medium to be very small on my female. She is a bit chubby, but it still had to go on the very last inch of both straps. The large one I bought for my male, fit him, but the back strap went right across his penis when buckled. I had to let it fly behind him like a cape. The first time he went into the woods, he came out with one strap totally unraveled. I had to cut it off. Then my female went into the woods, and came out with one strap completely gone. I'm so disappointed. I have e-mailed the company three times to see if they would replace it, and have received no response. I will not recommend this product or company to anyone. I'm at a loss on what to do next, seeings how there is no phone number anywhere to get in touch with them. They can just ignore my emails, and not be willing to help. I've since thrown both of them away, because they kept slipping off without the correct strapping. Hunting season is over, and come next year, I will look to buy something on the same line, but certainly not from this awful company.",dogs,3

"I have 4 cats, a total of 4 litter boxes including the maid. I bought the LME700 when it was on sale a few weeks ago. Here are my tips / thoughts.After opening the box I wiped down the entire unit, including the rake with mineral oil. This will help presents from being stuck to the bottom. After that we used tidy cat multi cats / world's best cat litter mix for litter. So far it has worked well, but I hear arm and hammer's high performance is a good litter to use with this machine. I will be trying this next.So far 2 of the 4 cats are using the box on regular bases (2-5 times a day) in the week I have owned the unit. The other two haven't tried because Cat #3 is a 17 year old cat; he's set in his ways. Cat #4 needs to go on xanax; she's a bit high strung to say the least.We line the bins with plastic grocery bags and that seems to work well. I don't find it difficult to remove the bags, and this saves spending money on bins.Occasionally if your cat takes a monster sized pee the rake might get some litter/pee attached. The unit comes with a scooper with teeth on the end. These teeth fit in-between the rake teeth, and make for an easy quick clean. If you cover it it'll scoop up the next time around. Of course since you rubbed the unit down with mineral oil (hint) you'll find that the clumps come off very easily.It will not pick-up pieces that are smaller than the space in-between the rakes (about 1/2 an inch). Big deal, I'm not fussy about that. As long as massive turds aren't sitting and stinking, I'm happy.I also do not find the unit to be loud. We live in a small 1100 sq ft condo and the unit is a doorway down and it does not both us when we are asleep. It does not scare cat 1 or 2, in fact sometimes they run over to watch the unit scoop their mess. (I watch too sometimes. Yes, we have a very exciting life).Make sure you get a unit with a 1000ma power unit. The older models came with a lower power source (12volts but lower ""ma""). This seems to power the unit better and prevents the unit from getting stuck going back and forth.And of course, don't fill past the fill line, or you will burn out the motor.So far my two cats loved the maid and are using it more than the regular boxes. I say it cuts down at least 80% of the work associated with owning a litter box. Just check on it daily and it'll be fine.**update**So I liked my LM700 so much i bought the LM900 when it went on sale. So now we have two 'maids, two ""manual"" litterboxes.The LM900 is a little bigger and I think works slightly better than the LM700. That is not to say the LM700 is a bad product. I think b/c the LM700 is slightly smaller then the LM900, the rake doesn't get an extra 3 inches to cover the pee/poo if your cat is not very good at cleaning up after him/herself. But that doesn't mean that the LM700 can't scoop uncovered pee/poo, it's just a little easier and more efficient if your cat is good at covering after him/herself. (Just think, if your cat takes a massive pee and doesn't cover the top, it doesn't form that outer hard clumped layer. So when the machine goes to scoop it MAY fall apart b/c it doesn't have that outer top covered layer)So I believe all four cats are using the box now b/c the manual boxes are aren't as full as they were about a month or so ago. I have seen our ""old-man"" cat use it, and Ms Xanax... I've seen her use it a few times. They will all watch the box if it is scooping and they are close by, but I have two that RACE over to watch it scoop. Dang cats need lives besides watching the box scoop their ""matter"" and eating my food.Two other things need to be accounted for when using a LM that I haven't mentioned. 1) Your Cat's Diet 2)Litter1) If you're feeding your kitty anything with meat/chicken/beef ""by product,"" just stop now. It's why your cats poo smells and may be ""soft."" Look at it this way; you're feeding your cats the equivalent of a Big Mac, or worse. You know that awful rumbling sensation you have after eating a Big Mac? (No, not the craving for another Big Mac... the OTHER rumbling feeling...) Same thing for your cat, so feed your cat something better. Purina One is a good choice (sold at most grocery stores), we feed our cats PetGuard and Wellness, excellent cat foods (In fact our cats eat better than us. No joke, one of the wellness foods has lobster in it. Freaking lobster! Can you believe it?) Anyways, better food, more solid waste comes out of your cat = less stinky litter box because you don't have runny turds sitting in the box. Also feeding your cat better food means better health for the cat (male cats tend to get their urethra blocked less), meaning less vet visits. So you're spending more money on the food, but it may save you a 10pm visit to the vet (like we had to unblock our male cat before we fed them better food).2) Litter",cats,2

"This is a great invention for pet owners. It works well, but the angle at which the handle is mounted causes the rake head to 'jump' as it is scraped across the carpet.

"I purchased this product after reading and comparing many reviews and prices on toilet training kits on the web. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try and purchased the CitiKitty kit. I received the kit and got started right away. To my pleasant surprise our 7 month old cat was using the toilet in a very short 7 weeks! It was very simple to do, and we got a head start because she was already using the litter box right next to the toilet so moving it on the toilet didn't change her routine too much. Going through the steps is going to depend on your cat, and I would encourage anyone that is just starting to pace the steps according to how your kitty is adapting to the change. We went throught the first 4 steps in 4 weeks, and I opted to keep her on the last step for 3 weeks because she was still using the lip of the trainer to balance herself on the toilet and I waited until she was consistently using only the toilet seat to balance before removing the trainer. My family and friends are so impressed, I've even turned a few antikitty people into kitty people, all because they now know it is possible to have an indoor cat and no litter box!Our kitty has really amazed us, and she seems quite proud of herself, she makes a special effort to use the toilet when we can see her do it (she always gets praised or a treat when she does, and I've started to wonder who trained who).I hope you'll give this product a try, I did and will again when we welcome our second cat into our home!",cats,2

"Purchased this playpen to allow my birds some active ""out"" time from their cage. My two Rosey Bourkes and Parrotlet absolutely love it, they are able to fly, (wings not clipped) and love to land on the perches. When item received, we put it together and then found a small packet of glue to glue all supports together. Glue should have been more visible from start, took all apart and applied glue....you do not need much. The birds love the different activity stations, we line the base with folded newspaper (quarter) for ease of cleanup. Highly recommend for parrotlets, budgies, cockatiels....small parakeets. This keeps them and you watching them entertained.",birds,0
"My two black Labs had very dense undercoats, and until I bought the FURminator, nothing would significantly grab it. The first time I used it, the FURminator pulled enough out to knit a sweater!

"My cats absolutely LOVE this squirrel! However, I made the mistake of only buying one for my two cats. They were both intruiged when it arrived and my dominant cat took ownership of it immediately.

"While I can't yet review how much my bird likes or dislikes the product (she's still weaning) I can at least review the product itself.The rope is tightly wound giving it a lot of support. The two connectors were very nicely designed and fit my 3/4"" bar-spaced cage perfectly. The 28"" Large perch was just long enough to make a nice loop in my cage and is thick enough for an African Grey to sit on comfortably. The packaging seems to imply Macaws, but I personally find it too small for their feet and may even buckle a bit under their weight.Either way, it is well constructed and well designed in the regard to attaching to a cage. I think this can add some fun and exciting new perch designs in a cage allowing our birdies to climb and enjoy the different texture (assuming they don't decide its a chew toy).",birds,0
"We have several of these and they do a good job at containing odors and have proven to be fairly durable. Only the plastic corners near the bottom of the stairs have chipped off in a few, which does not affect their functionality.Most cats don't mind going in these at all, even the cats that tended to prefer uncovered litter boxes. These will fit all but the largest cats.The steps are intended to keep litter in the box so you don't need to use a litter mat. In my experience, they help only a little. Cats who kick up a lot of litter or ones that like to dash out of the litter box after they are done still manage to track it outside.The litter box itself is easy to scrub out, with the exception of the stairs, which tend to collect litter and require you to overturn the whole litter box and shake it to get the remaining litter out. This is my main complaint about this litter box.The rounded shape of this litter box discourages cats from climbing on it, but it is stable enough so that it will not tip over and spill litter everywhere if a cat does jump on it.These litter boxes also have a nice ""futuristic"" look to them, although the rounded design is not at all space-conserving.I would recommend this litter box to anyone as long as they don't live in a small apartment in which space is an issue.",cats,2
"I found this product on Amazon! I'm caring for a feral cat which has decided to live right outside my front door. I kitted out a large animal carrier, insulated it well, and loaded it with soft padding and fleece blankets. However, Midwest Winters can be harsh. So, I searched well for an animal heater which would provide him with extra heat and found SnuggleSafe. I bought two discs and heat them twice a day (every 12 hours). They sustain continual heat throughout the day/night and I don't have to worry about the cat hurting himself because of wires or electrical shorts. Terrific! They've been such a success that I bought two more for my older inside cats. Thank God for SnuggleSafe!",cats,2

It's def cute and you probably won't regret getting for your kitty.",cats,2
"I bought this 24"" rawhide because several reviewers said their dogs worked on it for a very long time. Unfortunately, this was not the case with my 100 lb. Labrodane. He was pulling off large shreds within 2 minutes, had it broken in half within 10 minutes and chewed one half down to the knot in less than an hour. While I don't think this is a bad quality bone, the rawhide is not as thick as other bones I have purchased, which I am assuming is why he was able to tear it apart so fast.",dogs,3

The Tuffy's Junior toys like this Yellow Fish Toy lasted well over a week and brought a lot of joy to our dogs and saved us a little bit of money.

(Checked off most of the things on the list that they say can cause a cat to start eliminating outside of the box unfortunately.) I was desperate to find something to clean up the carpet spots.... this stuff is amazing!!! I bought a one gallon kit, whick had the black light and the large syringe (for injecting under the carpet) to start with, and it worked so well I bought the 4 gallon set, to have on hand for clean up. (Decided I wanted to be prepared.) It works fabulously on cat urine, which I think may be the worst smell on the planet. I have recommended this to several people. You may have to treat a spot a few times to completely eliminate the smell, but to date, I haven't found anything that works to remove that odor like this stuff. Very pleased.",cats,2

"My 25lb dog was barking constantly to either go outside or come inside and it was driving me crazy since I now have a newborn and couldn't always jump up and let her in/out right away. The barking would continue until she got what she wanted. Our dog is a very well behaved dog and we tried a shock collar before but it 1) made her overly submissive and 2) we had to have the remote to manually correct excessive barking. I did not want another shock collar for her so I looked into the Petsafe collar. It works very well with her. I think it scared her the first time she started barking and it vibrated, but it only took a few days before all the excessive barking stopped. I have now not had to put it on her since that first week as she's hardly barking at all now, except during normal and expectable times like when we play in the yard. I only gave it 4 stars because I did test the collar myself to see what it felt like and I do think it felt a bit like when you accidentally get shocked from putting a finger in an electrical socket. In other words, it did feel more like a shock than just a vibration. But it did work and has effectively corrected the behavior so I would recommend this to others.",dogs,3
"I gave this toy to my 50 lb lab mix, Maddi, a few days ago, with an everlasting treat in each end. She's been gnawing and playing with it ever since, and she still hasn't gotten in to the treats yet. I bought the large, and it's a little too big for her, but she doesn't seem to mind. She can't pick it up until the everlasting treats are chewed almost all the way through. It's given her plenty to chew on though. She hasn't looked at anything else since she got it.",dogs,3
"Do not spend 109 dollars on this product, it is simply not worth it. It is no less maintenance than a regular litter box. The motor is incredibly weak, even when filled to the correct specification I would have to go in and scoop waste out because I suppose it was to heavy, and the rake would just stop. If I had only kept my receipt for this I wouldn't have it anymore. If you do purchase this product, make sure you keep your receipt and your old litter box, chances are you will be using it again.",cats,2

"I bought this bowl for my cat. Initially I was very nervous as I had read a couple of other reviews saying that it was too big for cats, but honestly there aren't a lot of choices on Amazon for this style of pet bowl, so I picked it up anyway.I got it in the mail yesterday and all my worries were put to rest. Unless you have a teeny, tiny cat, this bowl is just the right size. It holds a good serving of food without threatening to overflow. It also looks very clean and streamlined, unlike my previous pottery-style bowls which tended to look very clunky and silly.The functionality of the non-skid on the bottom is just a delight. I put it down on the linoleum and was very gratified to hear and feel it thump straight down without sliding at all. The cat ate voraciously out of it last night and it didn't move an inch.A great bowl at a great price. Highly recommended.*important note",cats,2

"I have had the SportDog 800 for a month now and it has been fantastic in training and working with my 2 RedBone Coonhounds. Hounds are wicked scent dogs so I needed something that would keep them in line. Initially I only purchased one collar and worked one dog at a time. It seemed to be the right regiment for my hounds in teaching them the proper commands. After about 2 weeks, I felt very comfortable and purchased the 2nd collar. Reprogramming the transmitter was simple and easy. After a month, both collars are working marvelously and have greatly improved the enjoyment of our morning and night walks. I am not being pulled and the dogs have the freedom to roam well out of and within eyeshot. A word of caution and notice for the novice, these collars do not train the dog, You the owner/handler train the dog!! No kidding, Master of the obvious statement, but it begs stating that one must be 110% focused when training with these collars. If not, one could easily confuse and even mistreat one's dogs as well as frustrate you the handler. However, I have tried to be consistent and disciplined using the collar and hence they have been a real jewel. Next step will be to take the dogs out to the woods where they can really run. Thus far a good purchase and value. I will update this review after my ""deep woods training"".",dogs,3

"I used this on a Cocker Spaniel, two chihuahuas and a cat. The cat had the most dramatic results - it was like taking another animal off her and her coat looked fantastic. The cocker didn't have quite the same dramatic effect, but she didn't shed much in the first place. The two Chis shed like crazy and while I didn't pull off a whole pile of hair, I did notice a pretty significant reduction in shedding over the following week. Also, my chi who hates being brushed, actually really enjoyed being brushed by the FURminator. Overall a purchase worth the money.",cats,2

He's not a ""mega"" chewer, but there are some toys he definitely can't have because he chews them immediately, this isn't one of them. I like it because unlike normal balls there's a way for me to grab it. He won't drop it for me so it's often a wrestling game. I can get a good grip on this and twist it until he lets go. A favorite in our household for dog and owner.",dogs,3

"I have a 60 lb lab, who is a puller and has gone through about 5 leashes in 3 years. Her last leash was the medium Flexi retractable leash, which should be good for a dog up to 77 lbs. Other retractable leashes similar to the medium flexi snapped after only a few months of use. We used the flexi leash for well over a year before it started to fray slightly on the side. It is still very sturdy and we likely have months of use left in it (if not more), but I've gone ahead and replaced it with the large version for dogs up to 110 lbs. I would suggest going up a size if you have a dog closer to the upper end of the weight limit who is a puller, but still recommend this leash over any other leash we've tried.",dogs,3
"This crate is nice, the only problem I have with it it that the door on the long side kinda drops down. Being that it drop down it's hard to latch, if you lift up on the top though it slides right in. It's just a little hard for my 5 yr old to do. Otherwise, you can't beat the price in comparison to pet stores or even WalMart for that matter! The size is just perfect for our 6 month old Yorkie and he has room to grow!",dogs,3
"I have had the Litter Robot II for about 6 weeks now, and so far, I'm quite satisfied. My two older cats took only a week or so to adapt to their new litter box, but I followed the mfrg's instructions and left the old litter box beside it until they acclimated. I also cycled the unit automatically so as not to scare the kids.So far, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I no longer have the odious daily chore of scooping nasty litter (into another nasty container), and then sweeping or vacuuming up all the scattered litter. With two big cats, I find that I only need to remove the waste from the lined litter drawer twice a week. That, and maybe add a scoop or two of clean litter to the Robot to keep it up to level. The savings in cat litter alone will probably pay for this unit in no time.Prior to making this purchase, I was scooping every day, spraying air freshener to contain any odor, and dragging cardboard boxes out to the trash every two weeks so the kids could have a new, clean environment to use the washroom. It goes without saying that I was paying for a lot of litter (I was buying the 40-lb tubs at BJ's regularly) that were not being used efficiently.My review is only 4 stars because of the following complaints:1) the unit will not add to any decor imaginable. It looks as if a spaceship landed inside your house. I suppose I could spend another $100 or so and buy the wooden box to cover it, but it's not in my budget right now.2) Litter still gets scattered around when the cats leave the box, but to be fair, that's only a minor complaint. I vacuum or sweep around it regularly, and have set up an enclosed box around the entrance to catch litter overflow.3) When I made the purchase, I decided to spend the extra $ and get the latest and greatest (bubble version), but the step stair does not have perforated holes in it (to catch litter and divert it to the chamber below). I have yet to get a response from the Litter Robot customer service dept as to why this is. For the money, I expect only improved models of what is offered.So--here it is, folks. If you have one or more cats and are sick and tired of doing litter duty, I highly recommend purchasing the Litter Robot II for sure. One caveat",cats,2
"This toy box is colorful, light, spacious, and all around wonderful for storing my dog's toys.

"First, I am a real buyer and my dog is a real user (I always wonder about reviews). I have an 8-year old black Pug named Otis. I purchased these drops because he scratched his eye(itchy allergy eyes from the fall leaves in MN). It was a nasty scratch and it clouded up so bad I feared he permanently damaged his eye! Granted, he is 8 years-old and had a slight clouding his other eye too. So,if it didn't work on the scratch maybe it would work on the cloudiness.So, I took a gamble and bought it. The price was the lowest I have found and it shipped very quickly. But, the best part... it WORKS! I received it on September 30, 2012 and have used 1-2 drops nearly daily in the scratched eye and maybe twice a week in the other eye. It is now December 29, 2012 and his scratched eye is 95% healed. The cloudiness is completely gone in the non-scratched eye. My dog gets excited every time I pick up the tube because he knows his eyes will feel better afterward. I can't ask for more than a product that works well AND my dog loves it. Thanks Pet Vision!P.S. Yes, I did take my dog to the vet and the vet took the wait and see approach. I, on the other hand, bought this product and I am glad I did.",dogs,3

Heard so many positive reviews of using this product to eliminate tear stains that I ordered it right away for our Shitzu/Bischon mix. It may work great -- but we will never know because our dog refused to eat his food with this sprinkled on it. Smells and tastes bitter. Wish this came in a pill you could just give the dog.,dogs,3
I use the Fluval FX5 filter for a 125 gallon RES turtle tank. For anyone out there that knows anything about turtles the are messy!

"I probably orderd a bit too large of dishes but this is well made, does not topple over with my sheltie eating or drinking out of it and it just the right size height wise for my little guy. I do think raised feeders are a better way for dogs to eat and digest their food better. Very pretty and I keep mine in the kitchen. I only wish the sturdy stainless was a ceramic made bowl instead,but I was aware they were stainless steel when I ordered this set.

"this is bailey bones' favorite toy in the house, this ball is seriously awesome. i have a jack russell with the jaws of death, she ruins most toys in the first 15 mins of play, with exception of these orbee balls. The med is around the size of a tennis ball, a little squisishier and hollow, bailey somehow managed to get one end of the rope ( both ends are knotted inside the ball) free fairly quickly but she seems to like it better that way lots more to swing it by, she also fairly quickly perforated the rope ( pulling the inner blue rope out through the silver rope/casing but this she also seems to enjoy) anyway the rope part is very easy and cheap to replace. the ball itself is hardcore and worth every penny, bailey chews and shakes that ball to death everyday, but it doesnt show any wear at all, and it bounces really well through the house and through the yard. can't go wrong with this ball!",dogs,3

I just bought this unit 2 days ago and I could not be happier! I was ready to spend $400 on a crazy automatic machine (litter robot? Look like a spaceship for your cat!) because I was so sick of my cats litter box. Instead I gave this one a shot and I'm very happy!Look at the manufacturer site for videos - I won't explain it. But I went from digging turds out like disgusting treasure (not often enough so it got real gross and stinky ) to rolling it with ease anytime I went to the bathroom. Use the handle and never touch cat turds again.The only reason I was not going to buy this was cause of some of your reviews saying you were having problem with the latches/ tabs / assembly of the unit.THERE ARE NO ISSUES BUILDING THIS THING. SO EASY! The latches have big arrows on them and you just GENTLY SLIDE THEM OVER. Three of them. 4 seconds to do that. I'm not sure what you had problems with? Same with installing the little grate.. Stick one end in - bend - snap it in. Please read the instructions folks.Anyway this box is genius.,cats,2
A vet recommended glucosamine supplements for my cat's cystitis and tried to sell me a $45 dollar bottle of pills. I declined and bought this online with amazon. I mix 1/4 ounce in with my cat's food and I can tell you she loves the taste of it and she's a very picky eater. She's only 11 pounds but the 1/8th ounce looked like such a tiny amount for a bladder problem so I've been giving her 1/4 a day in her food. We're almost through our first bottle and her symptoms seem to be improving. Much happier kitty! I am glad I bought this product instead of the bottle of pills I would have to get her to swallow!,cats,2

"These smell so bad, our dog refused to eat them after the first few (even I can smell them, even after they're hidden in food). I bought several bottles, and they all smell the same.I've tried hiding them in peanut butter, cheese, hotdogs, even mixing them up with his food. (He refuses to eat the food, if it's mashed up in it. And we're talking about a large dog portion, so it's a lot of food for 2 small pills). The few times we managed to trick him into eating them, they did ease his pain for roughly 2 hours. That was a blessing, but not worth the constant hassle. He's grown so suspicious of his food, he's getting finicky in eating anything, which is a problem we didn't anticipate, and could be a serious problem down the road.",dogs,3

"My cat adores this toy! When she paws at it, it makes an electronic squeaking noise that sounds like a real mouse!It also has this slight bouncing action that makes her think it's alive. I don't know what it is made of, but there is something about the texture of the mouse that her sensitive paws really like!She is endlessly fascinated by this mouse. I only have one, so I am careful to watch it as she loves to bat it underneath furniture. Given that she is 10 years old, any toys that make her play this hard are always worth the money!She loves to hunt it, stalk it, bat it about the room, and then she skitters away at a hundred miles an hour.

this shampoo makes my Newf soft and smell like a baby. I really like it,dogs,3
"I love this. It is a beautiful piece of furniture. The color is darker than the picture, but lovely. It is more of a dark deep cherry or mahogany color. It is not a flat color, it has grains in it if you look closely. From far away though, it is a deep chocolate, almost black. It definitely is NOT the color in the picture.Putting this together was tricky, and I never have trouble assembling items. I will try to walk you through it. Make sure you keep the instructions that come with it and read them along with what I am writing. My instructions were stapled incorrectly and it took me a little while to figure out that step one was on page 3...so read very carefully.Step 1 First you can attach the towel rod to either the right or left. I chose not to, because mine is sitting in my bedroom. If you want the rod on the right (as you are facing the product, then attach it to panel B. If you want the rod on the left, then attach it to panel A. The side with the paneling in the wood is the outside. It is easy to attach. Put the rod through the wood, (paneling side out), then put on a washer and then use the nuts.Now to put the box together.Step 2 Attach locking bolts into the two outside holes on the inside of panel B at the end that has the curve to it. The inside is the side without the paneling. Screw them in using your hands and then use a Philips screwdriver to screw them in. Then put the wooden dowel in the hole in the middle.Then take panel D and turn it so the side with the little groove in it lines up next to the same groove in panel B. (D is the bottom panel, and the part that hangs down is the front...it is easiest to line them up so the grooves will be next to each other) The legs of B stick up in the air (the aren't really legs, they are the top section of B and that really confused me for a bit). You attach the two pieces by sliding D onto the two locking bolts and the dowel. (The dowel doesn't fit in tightly, so be careful not to let it fall out). Once you have the two pieces together, take the SMALL cams and then twist them so the part of the locking bolt that sticks out, fits into the notch in the cam. BE CAREFUL TO USE THE RIGHT CAM! I didn't realize until I had to undo the whole thing, that there were different size cams. Turn the cam until you find the point where it feels like it sits in over the bolt. Once the cam is in, turn it gently with your screwdriver until it is tight. It doesn't take many rotations until it is tight. I think, one to one and a half rotations. Don't over tighten. Tightening too much doesn't make it stronger. You aren't screwing something in, you are twisting the cam so it covers the locking bolt. You do have to get it in snugly, but be gentle.Then put the little brown screw covers into the cams. You don't have to, the screws are only seen from the inside, up to you.Step 3 The instructions then say to take panel G and slide it in the groove. It won't stay in there very well, don't worry, panel A will hold it in better.Step 4 Put the locking pins and the dowels into panel A the same way as you did to B. Attach A to panel D the same way you did with B. The section with the little groove will be lined up with the grooves on panel D. Before you put in the cams (Use the small cams!) and snug it all down, adjust it so you have panel G in the groove properly. It is a little tricky to get it in there, as it keeps trying to jump out. I did it myself, but another pair of hands would have made it easier. You certainly don't need anyone else to help if you don't have a person handy. Part G is the back of the unit, and the side with the sticker on it is the inside. Look at the instructions to see how it all slides together.Put the screw (cam) covers into the cams if you want, again, this is the inside and you won't see those screws.Step 5 was on the back of page two...so again, read carefully. Attach the knob to the outside of Panel E. The outside is the side with the paneling.Step 6 insert 4 locking bolts into part C. Do NOT put the dowels in part C. If you do, when you try to put part C down, they will fall out and you will have to crawl under the couch to find them. Instead, put the dowels in the top of parts A and B. Then, put panel C down over the dowels and lining up the 4 locking bolts into the holes. The notches are there so the C fits around the little legs. (I thought this was all going to be the bottom of the thing, but actually it is the top of the unit). The magnet on part C is the front.After you have part C in place, and BEFORE you put in the cams, attach the door, part E. It is easy, you just have to line up the little pegs in the holes, but if you snug down part C, you can't get the door in. Make sure the magnet on part C lines up with the metal piece on part E.Step 7 insert the SMALL cams and snug them down. This time it is a little harder because you have to reach into the box and do it by feel. But, you have down a bunch of these cams by now and you are a pro! It won't be that hard. Just make sure you twist them right so they can be screwed down. Up to you about those pesky brown cam screw covers.Step 8. (Almost done and it is easier from here.) Put the locking bolts into panel F. This is the top of the unit. The instructions don't say, but there are three sides that have a little lip on part F and one side that is flat. I chose to put the flat side in the back, but it would work either way. If you don't put the flat side in the back, the unit will stick out a little from the wall. Ok...got those locking bolts in place...now put F into the little legs that stick up. NOW, it is time to use the BIG cams. If you got this far, you should have 2 small cams and 5 large cams left. (The 2 small cams are extras and there is an extra large cam too.) Put the large cams into the legs, turn, and tighten. NOW, you want to be sure to use those little brown cam, screw cover things. These holes ARE visible.Step 9. This unit is supplied with 4 dark brown wood plugs that you can put in the holes for the towel rod that you didn't use. On my unit, those plugs fell out every time I tried to put them in. I decided not to use them at all. If you have the same trouble, try using a little glue and I am sure they will stay in. Just remember if you do that, you might have a hard time getting them out, or you might damage the wood, if you later decide to put the towel rod in those holes.Voila!! You are finished. I hope that helps the next person put this thing together a little easier than it was for me. I didn't realize about the different sizes of the cams until I had to take it apart to fix it. And good luck getting the wrong cams out of those holes after you put them in! It took a nail file, gravity, and a lot of frustration to get them out.As everyone has already stated, make sure you get a small litter box. Check the dimensions of this unit and find one that fits. I had what I thought was a small litter box and it is too big. Silly me. Should have measured. I wish I had looked for one on Amazon to order at the same time so I wouldn't be sitting here with a lovely finished piece but no way to use it yet. Ah well, I can wait until tomorrow. The dimensions of the inside are 18 3/4"" x 16 1/4"".Even though the thing was a little tricky to put together, I gave it 5 stars because it looks lovely. The opening to the unit is 7"" x 8"". Little kitties will fit in easily. I am not sure about the mega cats. (If you know what I mean.) If you have a super duper sized feline, I would suggest getting a cardboard box first and cut the opening that size and see if your kitty will fit.",cats,2

"I have successfully thrown away all of my leather collars and leashes after finding, and falling in love with, lupine. I found the collar (in the cute Suzie Q print) at a local vet but they didn't have the matching lead. I'm so glad amazon has them because I was really beginning to hate the way I'd have to wind my dog's leather leash around my wrists when I needed to reel him in. The fact that this matches my dog's collar is also a nice plus... even if he doesn't care. :pNot only does Lupine make soft and comfortable items, they have a lifetime guarantee if your pet should ever destroy their collars and leashes. My dog hasn't chewed through his leash since he was a pup, but the guarantee puts my mind at ease.If you do find that your dog is fond of making a snack of his or her leash or collar, you may want to take a look atGrannick's Bitter Apple for Dogs Spray Bottle, 16 Ounces.

"I bought this for my cat, who is fat and long. He loved it, but I had to hold him up while he was in it because there is no way to adjust the top. Therefore, my cat just fell forward and slouched over. I think it would have worked if there was a way to ensure that he would not fall forward. Also, it was too short for him in length. His arms wouldn't fit under the top straps, so they had to rest on top of them. He didn't seem to mind. I really wish this product would have worked out because I need a way to carry him around without using my hands.",dogs,3

"My husband and I bought this as a last resort method to try to keep Lola off our recently reupholstered vintage red couches (keep in mind that the reason we had to reupholster in the first place is that Lola made it her mission to pee on EVERY ONE of our four-piece furniture set). I'm unclear as to how the peeing Olympics began, but I'm guessing it's partly my ignorance in proper cat-training techniques and partly Lola being a cat and making things smell ""familiar"" to her (and gag-inducing to me).I read the reviews and decided it was worth giving it a try. I figured if we were spending the money to get our couches reupholstered, we might as well try as best we could to make sure that investment lasted. I bought the Large Scat Mat and was really excited to try it out once it arrived, but was disappointed to find out that the battery pack wasn't included with my purchase.I had to purchase it separately and directly from the manufacturer, but I got very helpful and friendly customer service from them and the battery pack arrived on time.I now realize that I made the mistake of buying the extension mat and not the mat plus battery pack, but I'm including this just so that first-time buyers are careful to order the mat plus the battery and not just the extension mat.I was worried that this wasn't a humane approach to training, but decided to try the thing out myself before trying it on Lola. I used the same setting I'd use for Lola to test (Low) and pressed my hand to the mat. It's a definite shock but it's not at all painful. It's the same feeling you'd get if you got shocked after sliding around on a carpet while wearing socks. In short it was uncomfortable and gave you a good scare, but it was not at all painful.The first time we tried it on Lola she came up to the mat we'd placed over her favorite couch to sniff it out, proceeded to try to curl up on the mat and then JUMPED RIGHT OFF! She tried it a second time to make sure it wasn't a freak occurrence and JUMPED RIGHT OFF again! She hasn't come anywhere near any piece of furniture we put the mat on. Needless to say, my couches are alive, my nostrils aren't offended at the smell of my house, and Lola learned that couches are not potties in two quick shocks!!! I am a happy customer and I have recommended this product to many people I know who love their pets and are looking for something that is a cost effective and time-saving training aid.",dogs,3
"My furbaby loves it (he actually lays in it sometimes when he DOESN'T need to go potty). It also works as advertised, which has been a very big help in comparison with the old traditional covered litter box.However, what makes me give this a 3 star rating are the plastic latches that hold the top and bottom together. They're very cheap and flimsy. IMO, they don't do a good job at holding the thing together, and occasionally slip while cleaning/sifting the litter. I fear that one of these days it might come apart and spill everywhere. The edges are wide enough that holes could be drilled, and bolts/nuts attached to hold it together better (in a similar way that some plastic pet carriers are put together). I think this would be a good future improvement to make to this product in order to make it better. I'll be making a trip to the hardware store soon!",cats,2

"My dog has chewed through several nylon collars before and this is the first one that has managed to stay on for more than a month now. In the beginning, there is a pretty strong ""rubbery"" smell but that fades after a week or so. Also, my dog's neck is about 9 inches and the size small fits her on the second smallest slot. The collar has come loose a couple of times already, I think because the top slot became disengaged. However, the collar still stayed on, just the front part was hanging loose. The rubber material is somewhat stiff and because her neck is slim, the collar is doubled up and thick on the side. This is also why the ""Fydo"" sign hangs to the side and not in front, as shown in the picture. Overall though, I am very satisfied with the collar. The material is very sturdy and the design is quite attractive.",dogs,3

"I have to disagree with the other reviewer a little bit. The toy is definitely not INDESTRUCTIBLE, but my 70lb pointer can chew up just about anything in less than 5 minutes and she hasn't gotten any pieces off yet in the 3 weeks since Christmas.That said, the product is basically just a big hunk of plastic that apparently has some flavoring in it according to the descriptions. I didn't lick it before I gave it to Checkers, and I definitely am not going to now. She likes it, but still likes her bone better. My main reason for giving it less than 5 stars is that the way it wears, the plastic starts to get little pieces where she chews on it. Similar to the wear on any hard plastic item that gets dragged on concrete. While she hasn't gotten any of this off yet, I'm concerned about her swallowing small pieces at some point. Considering the things dogs pass through their digestive tracks, it probably won't hurt her; however, it is something to be aware of if you are considering this toy.FYI.

"Ok, I've had this fountain for like 2 years. In the beginning I thought ""Wow, works well and the filter are at a reasonable price"". WRONG...keep reading.First - It's always a pain-in-the-rear end to clean this thing...Not only you have to take all the parts out to get a thorough cleaning but it's also VERY hard to get all the spots. I use a toothbrush, a sponge and Q-tips to clean and I still couldn't get to all the curve and corners. Bad design.Second - the curve and corners where you cannot get to, mold start growing there. (Brown/green gooey stuffs...)Third - This morning as I as cleaning the fountain, I dropped the little motor by mistakes. I'M GLAD...Why?? Because there were THICK brown slimey gooey stuffs fell out onto the floor. As it turns out, all the dirts/salivia are trapped INSIDE the little motor where you just cannot get to it.Keep in mind - I thorough clean the fountain every 2-3 days, I change filter on time and I only have 1 cat. After cleaning the fountain with a toothbrush, a sponge and Q-tips, I also pour hot water over it to kill any left-over germs. YET, ""stuffs"" can still grow in this fountain.If you care about your pet(s), PLEASE don't get this fountain...I have a Bengal and he loves running water...I just need to find a better solution.",cats,2
"I have this review under another listing for this product, can't believe it is still being sold!Amazon!! Please allow users zero or negative ratings on products!!___________________________________________________________________________Never!! Please, never ever use this product!We have two beautiful healthy young dogs (4-5 yrs), with a pristine health record (until hartz of course). They get premium food - Timberwolf Organics, Acana, Origen, Blue (I mention this because poor diet is often associated with illness in your pawsy companions).We had new neighbors with dogs move in a few weeks ago and my little one had started itching a bit. I was going to order frontline from petmeds and instead picked this up in a split second decision while walking out from Wallys. My logic being, ""hey if it doesn't work, I can still order the Frontline"". Plus it was priced at only $[...]On Saturday evening, I showered the girls and applied this on my itchy one. The next day my dog started showing signs of minor epileptic shocks - yelping in her sleep...yes I do know about dog dreaming, but these dreams, if they were that, were, with shock, pain and disorientation. Since it was Sunday, our regular vet was unavailable. We had no idea how serious this was about to become! That night, convinced that she was having a series of bad dreams we made sure she slept close to us on the bed. The episodes continued that whole night, a couple of hours apart.Next morning I noticed some swelling on her snout and one of her eyes. There was also a red spot on her belly. By that time we had read other peoples reviews on this product and were shocked that this poison is still put out for unsuspecting consumers!! Alarmed we called the local emergency care and described her symptoms. They urged us to rush her there. By the time we reached the hospital, my baby had gone into an anaphylactic shock. She had petechiae all over her abdomen and she was swollen all over!She was hospitalized after she was stabilized with steroids, antihistamine and antibioticts. Our woes did not end there though. I can go into more details, but I feel it suffices to tell you all that after about four thousand dollars and a homeopathic detox program, we were finally able to get her close to normal. After about a month and a half today, she still takes some herbs and supplements to support and balance her messed up immune system.Just ONE tube of the three doses!!The amount of anguish and death related to this product far outweighs the justification of dogs who might be 'flea free'. In the course of that week we must have met at least half a dozen vets who just shook their heads when I mentioned the Hartz product!! It has killed hundreds of cats apparently and is more fatal to their littler bodies (my dogs are about 65lbs each).There is a whole chronology of harm on [...]Please do not, do not buy this poison!!",dogs,3
"This was a big shocker. I got one a piece for my two dogs. They went absolutely nuts over these things, as if they were getting a hot dog. I used to buy them all the time until we left the toys behind on a vacation. The dogs loved the jerky rings but not so much the cornstarch rings. I would put the cornstarch rings on the outside and the jerky rings on the inside. Somehow they would eat the jerky completely without touching the cornstarch.Its a good toy and treat to keep them busy and out of trouble. The treats a fairly cheap as well as the toy. These might be a bit big for small dogs but I strongly recommend them. Great treat/toy.",dogs,3
"I guess the saying 'you get what you pay for' is correct in this case. The bed itself is fairly large with a comfortable mattress and a slipcover with a very soft microfiber plush type feel. The heating unit included is about 12"" square and you just place it inside the slip cover, so do not expect it to warm the whole bed, it's not large enough to cover the whole mattress area. That said, we put it in a large dog house on our covered patio and our elderly German Shepherd mix loves it. He's been sleeping on it for about two weeks now and obviously he likes it. I am just concerned that it keeps him warm enough when it gets really cold outside.",cats,2

"I have a Boston Terrier, who likes to chew, but won't just chew on anything. After a bad experience with a tennis ball (that he got hold to) and his intestinal tract, I've been very selective about the toys I give him. A lot of the other pet owners that reviewed here had pets on the upper end of that 50lb scale and my Boston (at adult development) is only around 20lbs, if that. So, I thought I'd give this a try and watch out for complete destruction of the toy. Well, from day 1 when we received this he took to it immediately. I don't know if this has a flavor, but he didn't touch any of the other toys we received the same day... only this one. And, he's chewed on it every day now for about 4 months. Only recently did I begin to notice that he'd finally broken through a corner and I tossed the toy. That white plastic can kill his intestinal organs if it gets in there. So, for the price vs. the length of time it lasted and he enjoyed it without cause, it's an ""ok"" toy. I'm going to buy him another one, but I think the key is to stay vigilant and be sure that once your pet seems to start puncturing through this, it needs to be thrown out immediately. Since he is quite literally never alone, this is not as big an issue as it may be for other pet owners. Please keep this in mind before buying!",dogs,3

"The CatStop came quickly and in good condition. It was easy to set up.However, it was more effective as entertainment than a deterrent for the neighbor cats. At first they learned to just stay just at the edge of its range so as not to trigger it. Then they must have gotten used to it because they learned to sit right in front of it, under the bird feeders, etc. Totally worthless.",cats,2

"I own a Golden Cocker Spaniel, and anyone who has ever tried to groom a Cocker Spaniel will know that their coat is not for the faint hearted, its thick and really tough to groom. I previously bought a ""cheaper"" Andis kit - the one with all the extra attachments, DVD and non-removable steel blades for around $30, well in a nutshell it was a bad move - it literally took hours of frustration for me and my dog. I decided this is not fair for either of us so I purchased these Andis 21420 with the detachable Ceramic blades for around $60 here on Amazon. FANTASTIC!! they cut like a hot knife through butter. There is minimal heat generated and so long as you clean the blades after use and apply the oil you will be happy. Bottom line my advice is spend an extra $20-$30 and you will not be sorry. These are solid, hardworking clippers!",dogs,3
"I enjoy feeding the birds and wanted a feeder which held enough seed so I would not have to refill every day. I bought two of these since they held 10 lbs. I did have to rewrap the wire inside one of the feeders the first time I hung them up as the weight (half full) caused it to come off and the feeder dropped to the ground. Wish the wire was attached to the feeder more permanently instead of just wrapped around. The wire on my other feeders is permanently attached and the only way it would come off is if the feeder was broken. Other than that, I like the feeder. Looks good, the birds like it and it will hold a lot of feed.",birds,0
"When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog. On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online. They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition. This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.",dogs,3

The bed probably is best for in-carrier use but since the carrier I have comes with one. I leave this fleece bed out on the floor in my room. My Linguini (a med-sized 8 lb kitty) fits in pretty well.

"Automated Pet Care Products, Inc. stands by their Litter Robots. Mine has operated perfectly past the warranty period, only just now breaking down a bit over 2 years after purchase.

Very quickly they realized I needed a replacement power jack and even sent me one complementary along with a youtube.com video link outlining the installation process! It was super easy and fixed the problem.I've been very happy with the Litter Robot and I'm glad I can continue to use it. Rake style litter boxes don't even come close. With the Litter Robot, I can use just about any plastic liner for the waste bin and any clumping litter I want; there's no special supplies to buy. It also does a great job of eliminating odors. Best of all, cats love it. In the few short days it took to repair, mine looked at his disassembled Litter Robot and meowed mournfully. Poor guy.",cats,2

"I bought the large sized bone for my 200 lb mastiff and it held up surprisingly well. The ""sheepskin"" was tougher and thicker than other similar toys and it was stuffed very firmly. It handled a couple of months of heavy duty play and two cycles in the washer and dryer, before being disemboweled all over the living room. I doubt anything but kevlar would hold up any longer to a dog this big and this toy lasted much longer than anything else I've given him. He absolutely loved it and carried it everywhere with him, even on walks. I'm back to order a couple more for him. I think a more ""normal"" sized dog would find it very hard to rip this one open. Great product.",dogs,3
"I was looking outside at my dog from the inside and started squeaking this toy (I know torture). I let him in right away, and it was hilarious to see a little sock monkey in his mouth. Once he found out how to squeak it on his own, there was no stopping him. Apparently he had a lot of fun with it in the morning because his monkey is now missing an arm. After much play, it was time for a nap. We couldn't snap a picture on time, but he was sleeping with his new armless friend right between his paws. You should buy it for your dog too!

"True, this box is two or three times the cost a typical discount store's large litter box offering; however, I've found this system more hygienic to clean than digging around in the litter with a scoop. I also had a problem with litter leaking out, but that was only on my first use when I (erroneously) assumed repeatedly flipping the box would be better than the recommended three steps conveniently printed right on the lid. I'm baffled by reports that a cat wouldn't use this box... there doesn't seem to be anything significantly different about it than any other covered litter box I've seen or used. I concede that I also thought the vinyl case seemed flimsy, but it has yet to seem to make a difference in performance. Given the comparatively low cost, I would recommend trying this product out before coughing up the big bucks for an automated system.",cats,2

Now, I just fill THE DISH, as we call it, at night and if I'm lucky I sleep through two whole feedings. It's fantastic.The motor is a little loud, but it's not enough to wake up a sleeping person. It is enough for my kitten to hear in other rooms and when it goes off he darts off in its direction. He know it's THE DISH that feeds him and not me, so he doesn't even bother with waking me up.Great device. Just invest in a couple rechargeable batteries and you'll be set.",cats,2

I'm slowlllyyy introducing it to him. I love the fact that it has two openings and that he can go in one side/out the other on his own to get used to the crate.

In the first week she had all the ribbons off of the toy and I'm still finding them from time to time under furniture. But, she still has a great time with the balls. She loves to throw the toy in the air and catch it and then try and pull it apart. Just a few weeks ago the elastic snapped from her using it too much and the green side went flying. I tried going to the local pet stores but after 4 or 5 stores I haven't been able to find the toy so I'm going to buy 2 more and hide one until this next one breaks. I'm hoping with her puppy stage almost over that it'll be quite a while before that happens.",dogs,3
"This is the second one of these I have owned. The first one worked OK but the ""improvements"" have made this new one worthless. The rake becomes stuck and backs up almost everytime the cat uses it. I have tried every premium litter on the market and nothing helps. Littermaid also has thier own brand which costs about FIVE TIMES more than any other brand- it doesn't make any difference.

I wrote the company customer Services who agreed that the two bottles was misleading and they would get back to me the next day after she talked to her supervisor. That was on December 13 and today is December 23 and still no response, even after 3 other emails from me. This company is very, very poor in customer service as well and misleading in their ads.

It is too weak to scoop the refuse out correctly and ,on ours, the rake hit a binding point at the end and would then 'catapult"" the refuse out of the box. The LM500 didn't last 6 months for us and it sounded like it was on it's last leg everyday.If you are looking at the LitterMaid automated litter boxes, pass by the LM500 and go directly to the LM900. The 900 is larger, stronger, and just plain better.",cats,2
"Really impressed with this. Seems well made -- I've had it for about a month now. Obviously you buy this for the way it looks, and it looks more like furniture than a cage. The dog seems to like it too -- I find him in it a lot -- and I think it's because this is more den-like than a regular metal cage. Note this is not wicker... it's heavy plastic with a wicker look, so I think it'll hold up for many years. I was concerned about spending this much money on something I hadn't seen in person, but it looks as good as the pictures suggest.",dogs,3

"The Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box was everything it promised. Just roll the litter pan over, the loose clean litter falls into the grate, the clumping dirty litter rolls over the crate onto the outside panel. When you roll the litter box back up right, the clumps of dirty litter and waste fall into the slide out tray. Remove the tray by the handle, dump contents into the trash and replace. The clean litter falls back through the grate and Kitty has a clean litter the use. The entire process only takes a minute. Really! I only have one cat, so once every two weeks I unsnap the lid and empty the entire contents into the trash, spray the inside out with water and replace with new litter.

"When we took our then-new bird in for a checkup and told our vet that we had already transitioned him from a seed-mix to his Roudybush she was so surprised and happy. She suggested we might supplement his diet (""his"" being our maroon-bellied conure) with some Nutriberries for fun, variety, foraging toys, and maybe a few extra calories (because he does tend to be a few grams underweight) - but Roudybush is hands-down the best food for birds. Their website has instructions for a few different ways to transition your bird onto this diet, but he had no problem with the first method we tried - namely, replacing his seeds with this 100% on the first day and seeing what happened.He was on colored Zupreem pellets for a little while before being on Roudybush and he didn't like them NEARLY as much as he likes this. Plus, the Zupreem made his poop turn rainbow colors that actually stained clothing purple, green, orange, yellow, reddish......nope, Roudybush is the winner here.",birds,0
"I am very well aware that every dog has a different personality and that not every product will work for every individual, but this product worked SO well for me that I am writing my very first Amazon product review to share my experience. I have a 7 year old female German Shorthaired Pointer. She is a very submissive nature and is very motivated to please and requires very infrequent and very minor vocal correction when she misbehaves. She is not a particularly strong-willed dog. She is, however, rather clever. We recently moved from a home into a condo, so neighbors in close proximity suddenly became an issue as she also suffers from separation anxiety. I had received a complaint from a neighbor that she had been barking and disturbing him. I feared eviction and immediately began researching products to correct this behavior. I ordered the Innotek citronella collar as well as a SportDog shock collar. I didn't think the citronella collar would work, but I was hoping beyond hope that I would not have to use the shock collar on her. To test, I put the Innotek on my dog, put her in her crate as usual, shut the door and went downstairs to listen....for an hour. I left my computer recording in the room with her. From my spot, I could hear no barking, only a couple whimpers initially. After an hour, I took off the collar and checked the recording -- she had gotten correction (just a tiny little ""pfffffftttt"" from the collar; nothing excessive) when she whined loudly and never progressed to a bark. I have used the collar a number of times, up to 9 hours, recording her each time (I REALLY don't want my neighbors angry!) and there has been ZERO barking since that collar went on. She usually whines a time or two, gets correction and calms down. It just never moves into a barking cycle. She does not seem particularly put off by the collar. She willingly lets me put it on her. She gets a treat each time she does. She smells like lemon Pledge when I get home. For me and my dog, this collar works incredibly. I can't speak highly enough about it. I can see where it might not work on a more headstrong dog or a dog that goes into violent barking cycles very quickly, but for a more submissive,""pleaser"" dog, this is a fabulous product.",dogs,3
"I have a little yorkie and she barks at anything. Like most dogs she barked at the mailman, that was ok. But then she started barking at children playing outside, cars coming down the street, a leaf blowing by. I was going crazy. I saw this device and did a little research on it and purchased it. It worked on her the first day. The funny thing is I only had to use it once. If she see me reaching for it she sits down. Good Dog!!!!",dogs,3

"We purchased our first size right harness at petco when we first got our dog almost four years ago (a 9 lb. yorkie mix). We weren't sure what size harness we would need exactly, so this adjustable harness appealed to us. We have had only positive experiences with this harness. Once you become familiar with how the harness adjusts and in the simplest terms, how it ""works"", this harness is awesome. It is adjusted to your dog's exact size and ends up snug but not too tight (we even have to make it a bit smaller when our dog gets his hair cut - that is how perfectly you can make it fit). If the harness is loose like the earlier commenter explained, then it needs to be adjusted or a smaller one should be purchased. We are on only our second harness in less than four years. Can't recommend this one enough. Petco hasn't carried this harness for years, so when I needed to purchase a replacement I found them here on amazon and the price is right!",dogs,3

"I have bought every single brush known to man for my cats. I have short and long, variety of hair types. My cats are indoor and they shed/hairball like crazy. It either is pleasing to the cat/ineffective, or effective with cats revolting and trying to bite me. Then I broke open my wallet for the furminator...This thing is FAN-TAS-TIC!!!! I have never seen more hair come off my cats. They LOVE being brushed with it, and I haven't seen a hairball laying on the floor since! They are very happy and their coats are so shiny and silky after grooming. I brush once a week, and it keeps my floors and furniture MUCH cleaner!There are different brush sizes available to meet the needs of different coat types, so make sure you buy the appropriate brush for your pet!",cats,2

"I have a seven month old puppy who was eating poop since she was seven weeks old. My vet told me about a product called Forbid. I read about Prozyme on line and I ordered it and my puppy no longer eats poop. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dog with a poop eating problem. Not only is the poop eating problem nasty, but it is not healthy. Prozyme really helped my puppy from getting into a really bad habit for her adult life.

Since I got it, I moved in with my fiancee (now wife) who has two cats of her own. They love it too! Yes, it gets a little slimy after it's been running for a couple days, but - it's water that you're leaving out, so you should expect to have to freshen it up! Cleans easy, works well, just remember to keep it filled up so the motor doesn't run dry. Great stuff, I'd buy it again (and probably will!)",cats,2
"Received the collar and put it on our 10 month old male beagle and noticed immediate improvement in his barking. The collar is easy to set up and fit to the dog. Our beagle pups tend to bark at anything that moves which can vary from a cat in the yard to leaves being blown by the wind. With the use of this collar, this type of barking has been cut dramatically. Even our neighbor has commented on how much less Shadow is barking. His 10 month old brother has only had to have it on a couple of times. Have used it for about a month now and do not have to put it on them as much. Usually only have to pick it up for them to stop barking. They play pretty rough with each other and the collar has survived beautifully. It was well worth the money and we much prefer this type of collar rather than the electrical shock type collar.",dogs,3
"My cats love them!!! Rather than calling for food, they want this the first thing I get home after work every day. I give it as treat to them when ever they did good.

I looked forward to receiving this as away to clean up the clutter of my puppy's growing toy collection. I was very disappointed when I received it. The first thing I noticed was that it was dirty and had a line of pen ink across part of the top. Then I went to take it out of the box and I was shocked by how flimsy the plastic is. This is really a piece of junk. I'm returning it and for what I paid I can get a sturdy Rubbermaid container. It won't look like a cute dog bone but it won't be a cheap piece a plastic either. Consider yourself warned.,dogs,3
"I am so relieved to find this formula. I have two cats that the vet had on Science Diet that we had to buy from him. When my husband researched it, we found that this formula was almost identical. They like it but do't overeat it. It is a fraction of the price, especially with Amazon Prime and Subscribe & Save. They have been on it for several months now and show no signs of any health problems. We want to switch them to a wet food as they might lose weight, but one is a juvenile diabetic that positively refuses wet food, so this is the only option. I am so glad to find this. I am afraid to do the math of how much we wasted on that vet version over the last 8 years! Thank you, Purina!",dogs,3

"To be frank, I purchased these as a 'filler' to get FSSS on an order for a Track Saw replacement blade. Our Scottie enjoys the chicken treats as well as the venison. The price was about the same as our 'premium' food specialty store, so I tossed them in on the order. We haven't 'met' a Zuke's treat we didn't like! Only one I don't care for is the 'Mini' version...just too small since we're not in training mode at ten years of age.Owing to the high 'natural' content of these treats, they are quite 'fragrant' and the aroma will hang around on your hands if you can't clean them soon after handling. Can't complain too much about that...that's why they make dry treats as well!We'll keep a supply of these on hand, mixing with other 'natural' treat products from time to time. Our Katie-girl gives them 'two paws up' !",dogs,3
"I have two Pomeranian puppies and they are great at making a big mess. Their favorite game was to drag their potty pads all over including into their kennel where they sleep and then shred them to bits and consuming some of it I am sure. This has stopped all that! The tray even has secure pad catchers in the middle allowing you to secure the pads flat to the surface to prevent wrinkling when they walk across the pad or if your pups are like my little Liberty, she likes to scratch her hind legs after she relieves herself. These catchers hold them in place. It takes two pads to cover then entire surface, but worth it! I highly recommend this product. It is easy to clean up and move around the house. Best investment I made for the pups yet!",dogs,3
"I have two cats that turned up on my doorstep the same cold winter night. One is a true farm tom cat and the other I believe might have been a pet to someone in her first few months. Anyway, knowing these cats have never used a little box I was really concerned bringing them indoors. I prefer to use all natural products so I thought I should try to find the same for them. This litter is great. It does control the odor extremely well and while the bad review comments are not 100% false what I have found to work is a thin layer of pine pellets, a layer of pine clumping litter then a load of the cedarific on top. The pine pellets are a great absorbent, the clumping pine takes care of the cedarific soft crumbles. The cedarific does track easier than other litter but I put a wee wee pad in front of the box with a litter mat on top which does help, but the fact that they both use the litter box without a problem is well worth a tiny wood chip here or there. Nothing a dust pan can't fix quick. You would never ever know I have cats if you didn't see them. It isn't inexpensive to do it this way but I only have to change out once a week with two cats. if they didn't like the litter it would cost more to replace whatever they used instead of the box- I am a huge fan of this litter.",cats,2

A couple training treats later though and I can get her up and down with my guidance which I will always do anyway since it is not terribly wide and for a young, spazy dog its easy to get a foot off of it. I'm thrilled to have a way to get her into new SUV though.",dogs,3

"My dog is a 40 pound terrier mix who sheds his wiry terrier-like overcoat constantly and generously. Brushing him often is the only way to avoid tumbleweeds of white hair everywhere. He hated the wire brush so I tried this one. He loves it! He sits still the whole time and wiggles with joy. I wish I loved it as much, though. It does remove hair, but not nearly as much as the wire brush. And a good amount of the hair that does come off ends up on the floor and my clothes. The hair that does stay in the brush is nearly impossible to remove completely. All that said, it does the job more or less and without torturing my dog! So my plan is to use the wire brush once or twice a week and use the Kong for daily touch-ups.",cats,2

"I foolishly bought the littermaid mega two months ago after many fights over who would clean the litter box. We have two cats, one is small(10-15 lbs) the other one is a BIG cat at least 30lbs. I have bought premium cat litter ""Scoop up"" and followed all directions...no luck. You can only put a small amount of litter in the pan other wise it gathers at the end and will not work. So...when you have a BIG cat the urine makes a goopy paste that simply sticks to the combs making a big clump of ""you know what"" rather than going into the receptical. Speaking of which...I was cleaning my litter box once a day. Now? Once a day...scraping poop off the comb, getting my HANDS RIGHT IN THE LITTER as I empty the receptical that is covered with litter and other goodies. Changing grocery bags and PUSH PUSH PUSHING them down testing and retesting the machine...otherwise the door won't go down and kitty will go elsewhere...which HAS HAPPENED. WOw look at the time I have saved?! NOT! Who should buy this? If you have one cat (small) that you know makes nice little poops and pees that you aren't currently scraping. Therefore,..IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY SCRAPPING DON'T BUY!",cats,2

Being a white dog, it really was quite obvious. After starting her on Angels Eyes, within a couple of weeks, it was amazing to see the difference. It's not a over night process. But it's sure worth the wait. You might think it's expensive. But once they are on it for a couple of months, you can cut back to every other day. That cuts the cost.

"The 700 Vari Kennel was sent in a flimsy box and arrived damaged. Amazon had UPS pick it up for a return and sent me another one. When the new one came, it was intact but upon close inspection, I realized that Vari Kennel quality seems to be slipping. I own many older Vari Kennel crates and have been very happy with them however, this one suffers from sloppy workmanship. Some of the bolt holes on the side did not line up and two were not completely drilled out. Additionally the door post was bent and had to be straightened out with a pair of channel locks. Now that it has been re drilled and straightened out, it looks good and is functional. On a positive note, the 700 series door locking system is much stronger (better) than on the 500 kennels, and the linen color is cool. Would I buy another one? Probably, but I sure do miss their excellent workmanship of days past!",dogs,3
can't say if this product exclusively healed my dog's wounds but it definitely helped...she was on meds and wearing a 'comfy collar' that also contributed to healing however this shampoo is so far my favorite...it's a medicated shampoo so it doesn't necessarily smell like fruit or flowers but it gave her a clean smell and made her fur super soft..plan on buying this again when we run out.,cats,2

So I never owned the older model so I can't compare it to that. In my opinion this thing is awesome. I have had it up and running for about a month. I have one cat and it works great. Once a week I empty the container. I put a shopping bag in mine and reuse the container though. The motor although loud seems powerful enough and the only timed it had to reset was when i put my hand up against it and stopped it purposely haha. I also use Arm & Hammer Super Scoop and spray the rake and litter pan with a no stick litter box spray I got at the local pet store. As far as smell goes I have the litter box in my bedroom and the only time anyone gets a hint of smell is right after the cat goes #2 but it is minor and short term. Once the cat cover the mess up smell goes away and I never smell it again! So my only complaint would be the noisy motor but not having to scoop I can live with the sound.,cats,2

"Lupine makes the best collars around, and the colors are so vivid and bright. I wash my collars in the washing machine, and they are definitely color-fast and do not lose their luster.The great thing about Lupine is that they guarantee their products for life, even if chewed.I do have a preference for the 1"" collars, as I like the thick and sturdy look of these. Also, if you have a dog that is stubborn or had a narrow head (like a Basset Hound) then the ""combo"" collar is for you! It allows for the collar to be loose on the neck but tighten when you need it most.Otherwise, this buckle collar works well if your dogs head is wider than its neck.",dogs,3
"We ordered this gate becuase we have a young dog and 2 cats. The cats need to be able to get away from the dog and at the same time we sometimes need to need block the dog out of the kitchen. We had been using a plastic baby gate but it was a pain constantly taking it down and putting it back up.This gate looked like it would fit the bill perfectly. It has the ability to be put up temporarily or more permanently using the wall brackets, and a small animal door for the cats.There are pros and cons to everything so here are my thoughts.PROS-Easy to install. Read the directions though, it made it much easier even though it is a simple item-Side pieces for larger openings are included-Small pet door-Easy for my older kids to operate- when installed properly it opens and closes easily, can be locked or not. Make sure you take notice that the door latch can be put into a sort of soft lock so it's easier to open and close-Price, much less on Amazon for the exact same gate at PetSmartCONS-Not very pretty. If this was made in a wood trimmed gate I would have loved that-Unless installed evenly the swing door is a pain to align, it took us a few tries, so be patient-As others said the small door really isn't great. The opening is too large, and it doesn't easily stay in the open position. Our 35 pound tall and thin dog went right through it army-crawl style, so we had to make a modification. We cut one of the bars out of the small door with a hacksaw and leave it in the shut position. This way the cats can always get through but the dog can't, but now the kitchen in never fully blocked.-The plastic knobs feel as though after a few uses they may end up stripped. Not sure if that will happen since we just got it so take that for what it's worth-This is being sold as a pet gate, not a baby gate. Having kids myself, I don't think I would trust this with a curious climbing toddler, and the small door has a piece that feels like it could become loose and be a choking hazard. Just something to keep in mindUPDATE- After owning this gate just one month, plastic broke off the handle which made the gate not work properly. 2 small tabs broke right off the handle. I called the company, and they knew exactly what I meant, even though this is a hard thing to describe, and said the handle is back-ordered but they will be happy to send me one. When I asked if this is a common problem, the friendly rep said, ""well, we do know if the handle is left in the upright position and there is pressure put on the gate that can happen."" I don't know how our broke, but since we have kids, this is possible. I would like to think the new handle is a new and improved plastic, but probably not... So keep this in mind if you buy this gate, that the handle should always be in the down position to avoid this problem.",dogs,3

"This little product almost brings tears to my eyes. My fiance brought his dog to our home with warnings of ""She broke a Dyson vaccum, we have to vacuum daily, she sheds like crazy, there is ALWAYS hair someWHERE...""This dog is an 80lb Shepherd mix and his shedding warnings were an understatement! After a year of Zoom Grooming, hours of brushing, frightening baths, and DAYS of vacuuming the back seat of my car even after it's covered with a thick cotton rug--this little tool has ended my anguish and anxiety. *Sigh of Relief*Hair drippage has been reduced DRAMATICALLY after 1 hour of serious work with it, followed by daily Furminating. She is sleek, shiny, and not shedding! Granted there is some hair here and there but not globs of hair bushes sprinkled about the house. I get emotional just thinking about the cleaning freedom! The poor dog was distressed even by the zoom groom but she is pleasantly surprised by the Furminator. She doesn't flinch when we use it and she has expressed no discomfort at all! She is squeamish about all things related to grooming and would run even from the very gentle Zoom Groom!The only downside--and I mean this is minute--is that the Furminator will find a LOT of hair and you need to be prepared with an adequate receptacle. We went wild using it in the backyard and bushels of her hair made its way back inside on the wind, our feet, and on cat/dog paws. It gathers the hair into fine bunches.A miracle product!",cats,2

I've heard that Solgar products have more filler in them. I don't know whether that's true or not.I have very little cartilage between my knee bone and cap. Several years ago, I could barely get up and down a flight of stairs. But after taking the Solgar product for three weeks, I was playing tennis. Don't get me wrong. My knees still suffered and were often swolen after I played. And where I could run around the court, I still had difficulty stopping and changing directions. Even so, this product has made a tremendous difference in the quality of my life.I experimented with other brands, but always went back to Solgar. Indeed, different body chemistries sometimes absorb and react differently to certain remedies. It wouldn't hurt to experiment with Solgar and other brands to see which one works best for you.",dogs,3

"Our new apartment's previous owner let her smelly, though lovable, bulldog into the carpeted bedroom. Even after the professional carpet cleaning, the smell was so strong my fiance couldn't even sleep in the room! A friend suggested X-O, and we couldn't be more pleased. After just one application the room smells like it should - only a little musty now from the dander embedded in the carpet, but it no longer smells like the dog is still living there!",cats,2
"We got this when our 50 lb labradoodle was just a puppy and used it mostly for running with great success. A year later we had our daughter, so I started walking a lot with a dog and stroller. It got to be very frustrating with a regular leash, but once I thought to use our ""running"" leash it made my life so much easier. Now I have two hands to push the stroller if I need them and my arm doesn't get yanked off if the dog lunges. I can't imagine surviving without it, I even run with both dog and stroller without any issues.",dogs,3

It is very sensitive and so will often go off if they scratch themselves or shake their head.",dogs,3

I had another brand that worked really well as far as absorbing and being a good size. These were regular size but were smaller than the regular size of the other brand.

"I have 5 cats and 7 dogs that reside in their own large den. The dogs love to graze the buddha boxes and knock them over so they can have hors'deauvres a la cat poo. I love these boxes, because I can put the opening toward the wall so the dogs can't get to it, and I can also clean them easily as often as needed. I did not want to invest in an electric litter box, since I was afraid the dogs would ruin it. These litter boxes are great and I don't mind turning them, since I get the poop and clumped urine out quickly. I purchased two large boxes, since my cats are quite big (>12 pounds). Am not sure how the regular sized box would do.",cats,2
"This gate solved a problem for me. I have two large collies who think that repairmen and visitors that come to my home are there to visit them. They are so happy that we have a visitor they do not leave them alone. They actually think they are helping the repairman by kissing him, bringing their toys....he cannot get his work accomplished.By purchasing the gate, they can stay in a large room with their beds and toys and some treats. It has worked out perfectly...the little doggie door lets my cat visit them.This gate is solid, well-built and much better looking than a wood gate. It includes two extensions in case you want to move it to a larger opening. I especially appreciate the walk-through door when the gate is not being used. It is also tall enough that my collies cannot jump over it!I recommend it highly.",dogs,3

"I have a 60 lb. year-old border collie who is extremely excitable when company comes. When people come in, he jumps all over them, whether they are 80 or 2 years old. He even knocked people down. We just can't have that. We really didn't want to result to a shock collar, but we had to get control. We use the sound alert mostly. It gets his attention & works most of the time. Then we go to the shock on low settings until he responds. It seems like he is getting better. Now if he hears the sound, he calms down much quicker. He still get jumpy, but not nearly as bad. I think it will continue to get better as he learns. He actually likes to put it on! (I think because he know company is coming)",dogs,3

"My dog really loves this bed, and I do to.I wanted something that resembled a mattress, because she's attatched to my bed, however almost everything that I came upon was ridicuously expensive or flimsy ($100+ for an orthopedic bed... she doesn't have arthritis so why bother!)Finally I came to amazon and after taking a look at the reviews for different styles of this bed I decided to buy one. Even though my dog is definitely a medium I decided that I needed a large (if you have a dog that is a medium but likes to stretch out rather than curl up you should probably do the same).It's perfect for her, but I do have a few complaints.-The top fabric attracts loose fur and dirt, so it becomes dirty fairly easily.-The foam starts to sink after a month or so-There's no traction and it's really light, so you have to keep this on carpet to avoid it sliding around.-She's still using my bed because she likes to stay near me (I keep her bed out in the hall)*Note* For washing, do not wash this with anything else because the fur will come off and it may stick on other items.",dogs,3

"I have a 13 y.o. Golden Retriever who was having a very difficult time getting up and walking. She had lost all muscle tone in her hind quarters because of this and I was afraid that my time with her was getting short. Her spirit was still pretty good, but she would fall down often and then struggle to get up again. I started her on a combination of Cosequin DS and Liquid Health's K-9 Glucosamine on Thanksgiving weekend and am amazed at the difference it has made three months later! Actually, she started showing signs of improvement within a few weeks of starting her on the supplements. Last weekend she even ran several laps around the back yard. She is still a little slow to get up and limps for the first couple steps, but once she regains her balance, there is no stopping her! She is as playful as she was at two years old again. Highly recommended!",cats,2

It hasn't stopped the problem but it has cut it down significantly.So if you have poop eaters, give this a try if pineapple doesn't work.",dogs,3

"I am very happy with the quality of this metal folding crate I purchased over the summer. It is heavy, but sturdy, and the three doors give added flexibility in positioning the crate for use. I only use the crate for long road trips in our large SUV with the family of 5 and our 100 lbs Golden Retriever. This crate is very large, so check the size to make sure it will fit in your vehicle if that's where you plan to use it. It's nice to be able to fold it up for storage when it's not in use. The plastic tray had a small crack in the corner when it arrived, but it wasn't a big deal to me and we have used it several times without any further cracking. This is the best quality folding crates for the money that I could find. I would order it again without hesitation.",dogs,3
"For the most part I like this pet door and think it works well. However, it has one tragic flaw which I had to remedy myself. The problem is in the flap - it doesn't weigh enough at the bottom to shut if a breeze is blowing by. I had to attach a small steel plate toward the bottom of the flap in order to weigh it down enough to shut every time. I suppose if you install this pet door inside an interior room door, or through an attached garage to house door it wouldn't have a breezy flap issue. Otherwise, be aware of this potential problem. Installation is very straight-forward. I chose to install it on my storm door. Just be sure to make your measurements twice so you don't make any cutting mistakes. Remember, you've only got one shot at making a proper cut!If you're worried whether or not your dog will use a doggy door, rest assured he or she most likely will. I have a Shiba Inu (They are well known for being stubborn), so it took several days of holding treats on the other side while partially pushing open the door flap before he finally started walking through it by himself. At first it seemed hopeless, but if he can figure it out, I'm fairly confident most other dogs will too.",cats,2

"We prefer the 'guillotine' style of claw clipper for our five cats as it is less likely to shred the claw and does a neater job of removing the tip. We also find it easier to use than the 'scissor' type clipper, but be sure to get some replacement blades, otherwise you will begin to shred your cat's claws.We've been using the Resco brand trimmer ever since our Humane Society friend clued us into the product. It's a very sturdy clipper and the blades are easy to replace--just don't remove the two little screws like I did before reading the directions--press down on the blade ejector tab and the blade pops right out.These are heavy-duty blades, and you can go for quite awhile (up to a year) between replacements.",dogs,3

He is now an obedience-trained, well-mannered dog, but I don't think it would have ever been possible without the Sporn Halter.

"My dog loves playing tug. I had been buying the rope tugs, but I couldn't afford them at the rate she was going through them. The other problem with the rope style is that if it she got to it unsupervised, she would destroy it. I wanted to try a rubber version. This was the first one I bought, and I chose it because it was relatively cheap. I didn't want to spend a lot on a toy that might not work out for us.To my delight, this tug toy was perfect, a great value and the item I will buy again when it comes time to replace it. My dog loves it as much as her ropes, although there was an adjustment period, and she can't destroy it quickly. This is really saying something because chewing for my dog is serious business.It's worth noting that the product I received looks different from the item pictured on Amazon. The good news is that the item I received is fundamentally the same and is actually more attractive.",dogs,3
I have two 13-year old Chihuahuas and they absolutely must have indoor pads to prevent all their little accidents. I've tried tons of different pads over those 13 years and these are the first ones that really absorbed the pee and didn't let any leak off the edges or puddle so they make little pee-prints when they walk away OR use up the whole pad with just one tinkle.Definitely recommend these for small dogs who cannot 'hold their water' for hours. My girls can use each pad about 3-4 times and there is no odor in the room - great money saver!,dogs,3
"I have the older Van Ness Model CP7 that I purchased locally over 10 years ago - in fact, I bought two of them the summer of 2001 from a local pet store and they were $25 then. One of them is still in use, although missing a handle - who needs a handle anyhow, I don't carry the litter boxes around.The other one I recently tossed out due to a latch breaking - not a big deal considering these latches held up being unlatched every day, sometimes twice a day for 11 years. I was so happy with my older CP7's that I wanted the same model.There are a few differences and only time will tell if the new CP7 is built as well as the old. The plastic used for the new seems more bendable, the latches a little more flimsy, but more bendable plastic isn't always a negative. The latches are now on the sides. The finish is more slick on the new CP7 and that makes fresh P-clumps easier to scoop.One thing I didn't care for on the new one is the swinging door. Sure, it may keep the smell inside the box, but do you really think your cat will enjoy being in there with no fresh air? The door easily snaps off to be tossed in the trash.I don't understand the complaints other reviewers have about their cats that pee standing up - with the pee getting into the edge of the box where the top meets the bottom. Every enclosed box I've come across has the same edge, and, yes, I have one cat that stands up to pee and it doesn't flow out all over the floor - it's contained in the ledge area of the litter box and so easy to use a wet paper towel to clean it up while scooping. I'd venture a guess if the pee is running out of the lip all over the floor, you aren't cleaning the box often enough.I love this box being made in the USA, keeping money here to help our own economy instead of China's. A couple months ago I bought a HORRIBLE litter box from Petco (made in China)Petco Jumbo Enclosed Litter Box- I tossed it after a couple months when I found the Van Ness CP7 was still being manufactured.See additional note in Comments section below.",cats,2
"My boy kitty named Bunny drools when two things come out, and neither of these is me or food. Da Bird makes him ecstatic like no other toy he has. Bunny can be anywhere in the house - even when he's sleeping - and he runs to me ... salivating ... the moment I even touch Da Bird. In fact, Bunny loves this toy so much that he almost destroyed it within a few hours by tearing the feathers from the base ... but I saved it and this is how. I took the feathers he tore off and put them back in the small black plastic piece (looks like 1/2 of a pill capsule if you take it apart). Then I tied them around several times with the (very thin) plastic 'wire' I use for hanging pictures. Then I wrapped some narrow black electrical tape over that. I also used this tape to wrap the toy in other areas that previous reviewers noted as (possibly or actually) 'dangerous.' After about four months I purchased two of the Da Bird refills to replace the original feathers that Bunny ripped to bits over time. He still goes crazy over Da Bird, and when I am not playing with it, he drags it around my house and plays all by himself. TOh yeah, the other 'toy' that Bunny drools for is Zoom Groom, which takes off more fur than any other brush I have used, and is also a chew toy for my fantastic kitty.Kong Zoom Groom For Cats",cats,2
"I bought this feeder regardless the negative reviews for my over weight cat. Some time my husband will feed him without knowing that I already did, and he will eat up everything in his food bowl. The instuction is simple enought to just follow the steps to program the feeder. However when I fist plug in the feeder to the timer, the food constantly drop. Then I realize it is on the ""on"" fuunction. I change the ""off"" and to ""auto"" the feeder works great. Later I use the ""on"" fuction to measure exact time and food drop to reprogram the feeder. My other cat love this feeder too, so I bought another one for her (they don't share food.) She is the one learn to paw out the food. I don't worry very much because she can only paw out certain amound of food afterward she can no longer get more, and it is her future portion too. She will not over eats food at all.

I have one of these for my Yorkie who usually likes to ride in my purse which is not so covenient for me. She LOVES this car seat so much. I put her favorite blanket in it and she just lays down now and enjoys the ride. She loves it so much that I just ordered one for my daughters little Chihuahua who thinks he absolutely has to see where he is going. We put a high cushion in her car so he could see out the window on the passenger side and he loved it but we wanted something safer that he wouldn't fall off of in case of sudden stops or sharp turns. He usually tries to sit in the drivers lap and look out the window which makes driving difficult and dangeous. I'm sure this will be perfect for him. I had him for a day and he and my Yorkie both fit in mine and loved the view from the doggie car seat. It's a great product and you can't beat the price compared to other ones on the market.,dogs,3

Simple airline-approved cat carrier that comfortably fit our 9 pound domestic shorthair. Fit under the seat with room to spare. Delivered quickly. The plastic is not heavy duty so it's probably not robust enough for frequent travel. The one downside to this model compared to others of similar size is the lack of a wire top door. It might be harder to wrangle a frisky cat into this carrier than one with a wire access door.,dogs,3
I have an old english sheepdog. He absolutely loved the treats. It took him longer than I thought it would to eat through one so I could eat a treat in peace while he chewed on his. It was great.,dogs,3
"Great product! So easy to use. It has five spaces for food, which is perfect for my cat. He throws up his food because he eats it all at once, so I had to start feeding him only a little bit at different times. It was hard to do that since my daily schedule changes a lot. This feeder is perfect because I load it once a day and he's always fed every six hours (that leaves one empty slot of food, which is usually the current one when I load the other four).Requires batteries, size D, and that's fine. As soon as I loaded them, the feeder turned on. Instructions made it clear how to load the feed times.My cat hasn't tampered with the product at all (yet). I know another reviewer said his cat just pushed the servings to get to all five slots. My cat is not that smart. But he is that hungry! My gosh, he still thinks that my only role is to feed him....",cats,2

"Got this on a whim for my 4lb 3 month old Dachshund puppy and I'm glad I did! She's not a tough chewer so I don't experience any of the issues other owners are seeing. This toy is super fun and keeps my dog entertained for a long time! Her favorite treat is boiled chicken breast so I just stuff a few cubes in, twist it to a challenging level and let her have at it. It's shape allows for unpredictable rolling and wobbling so it keeps lil pupster challenged for an hour or two at a time.",dogs,3

"The squirrel lasted less than 48 hours. Generally the least expensive stuffed toys from pet stores last 3 to 4 months before the fabric rips. My dog likes to ""kill"" the toy, have someone throw it, retrieve it, play tug-of-war and start the process again. In a matter of minutes the fur was coming off. After the third or forth ""kill,"" stuffing was flying all over the living room. Never have I bought a toy that fell apart as quickly as did this squirrel. I will sew the rips and see if we can get another few hours of play as my dog really liked the toy.",dogs,3

"This wonderful durable toy is made by Fat Cat Inc. They started their business off simply creating gifts for their own family pets. It turned into a thriving business. Once you purchase one of their toys you'll see why they have become so popular! They are made of a high quality canvas material, and each seem is sewn three times! Not your typical dog toy here. Our dogs love playing with these toys. They've yet to destroy one. They are not the type of toy that merely gets played with once or twice and forgotten. Nope, they are constantly dragging them through out the house and outside. They take a beating and keep withstanding all that doggie attitude our pets can muster. Give em' a try, you'll love seeing your dog happily playing and if it gets dirty, you can throw it in the washer and it comes out like new ready for the next adventure :)",dogs,3

My 18 year old kitty loves this mixed into her wet food. She has been taking the capsules for 1 1/2 months. She has kitty arthritis and kidney disease. This capsule does not contain liver or other organ meats that is bad for older cats and cats with renal/kidney disease. There has been a very noticeable positive difference in her walking and jumping. She can hop up on chairs easier and is running up and down the stairs with greater ease.

The top of the plastic (or maybe it's just thin glass) tube popped right off.It looks nice, it's not too big and wont block the view of whats in your tank, and it's accurate as far as I could tell.

He is VERY smart, Tall but THIN.. and Can break out of one of those metal kennel things..

Although they are more expensive than traditional toys, they are completely worth it for powerful chewers.",dogs,3
"The product arrived quickly from Amazon and is a great deal - practically wholesale price. We let our 75 lb. Dalmatian wear it for 3 days as part of the ""training"" routine before turning it on. Then we filled it, tested it, and it worked great for a couple days (he virtually stopped barking) before it simply stopped working. Tried a new battery, nothing.Called Premier customer service and the response was quick and courteous. I'm sending it back for a replacement while I purchase another one from Amazon.com. From the research I did, I couldn't find a better alternative - if I'm wrong, please let me know. I'm willing to give it one more try since it worked so well initially. Hopefully the one we had was simply defective. I'll try and remember to write back with an update.As far as the battery that comes with it - the replacement battery I bought was a Duracell 28L lithium battery for $6.75 and the local Battery Plus store. It is supposed to last 3-4x longer than the alkaline battery that ships with the collar. Incidentally, the battery that shipped with it is still full (used a battery tester), so now we're stoked up on batteries. Hopefully the next one will last longer!",dogs,3
"My dogs goes crazy over these treats. They know where I keep them and they will stand at the counter and wait there until I get one for them. Everyone always comments on how clean their teeth are and that is a big contribution to these chips. I tell all my dog loving friends about them and I am so glad that someone recommended these to me. These are the best natural treats for your dogs, no artificial ingredients or preservatives added, only sweet potatoe. Get them, you won't be disappointed.",dogs,3

The latest PIF 300 kit with the PIF 275-19 6 setting receiver collar works great. Before you buy these you have to read the product information in detail to understand how it works.

"Better than the kongs for my clever girls (German Shepherds) because the rubber pieces over the hole make getting the treats out more of a challenge. I get the large size and can fit over 1/2 cup of their kibble in them so can actually give part of their meals in the Squirrels to give them a challenge but save on the calories. I love that I can put a mix of small soft treats PLUS quite large treats so have the challenge be easy and harder. HINT for new pups is that you can use scissors to cut part of the obstructing rubber pieces that are over the hole to help teach the dog what to do and make it easier. Though once they get it, you may have to buy a new one to up the challenge again!",dogs,3

I've had it for over four months now and it's still in great shape. We usually make an arch and the bunnies nap under it or practice hopping over it. They also like to climb on top, sit back on their hind legs, and look all around! My only complaint is that the dye runs when you wash it.",bunny rabbit central,1

"This is just a little longer than a standard 5 gallon bucket, with a lid that screws on and off, and a design proven over years and years of use.I have the other style Vittles Vault as well (Vittles Vault 40-Pound Stackable), and those use slightly smaller lids. The lids are not interchangeable.The Gamma2 Vittle Vault - 20 lb will not hold a 40 lb bag of Innova Large Bites dog food, but as described (""20 lb"") I did not expect it to either.One of the sellers, Quidsi Retail LLC (Wag.com), is very responsive. The manufacturer, Gamma2, also is very responsive and easy to deal with. I called Gamma2, and they say the Gamma2 Vittle Vault is safe to store human food as well. That's good, because many of the emergency and survival websites sell off-brands for more money. Vittles Vault (Gamma2) is the best known manufacturer of pet food storage out there. Many well-known distributors of industrial storage products resell their lids for uses other than pet supplies.",dogs,3

We went to the St Patrick's day parade in a large city with lots of other dogs, children, and distractions. All three dogs walked very well without pulling hard, choking and caughing. They were well behaved with out having to be yelled at or them being harmed. We like to go for walks and now we all can go on them together and enjoy them.",dogs,3

If you have a cat who is always getting into things and trying to figure out the world, they will probably like this little puzzle toy. I ended up buying a few extra balls for it. They get so excited when they get one out that they tend to bat it around the house in a bouncy prancing way before going back to get another ball out of the box. It's pretty cute.",cats,2

"The main complaint is that the bottom of the carrier is NOT flat and you pretty much have to use a pad of some type. Then there is the problem of the pad sliding around during a road trip. We used kitchen grade shelf liner that provided adherence between the pad and the plastic bottom. It would be nice if the door had the same mechanism on both sides so you could open it either left or right handed. We have two carriers so we set up one to left-handed and the other right-handed hinging so we could choose which one to use in our transporting needs. Overall, it met our needs/value.",cats,2

"I found this product to be very helpful in maintaining my aquarium at7.0. Don't expect this to be a miracle cure that keeps your tank perfectly at7.0 forever. This is meant to be something that helps you to avoid sudden shifts in pH, maintain a relatively stable pH between tank changes, or helps to bring your pH back to 7.0 when something altered it.There really is no true way to keep an aquarium exactly at 7.0, and if the pH is changing rapidly that would be an indicator that there is something wrong with the overall water quality of the aquarium. Simply forcing the pH to remain at 7.0 doesn't mean water changes can be skipped or that overfeeding won't harm the water quality; all it really means is that the pH is within the ideal range of 7.0. I do bi-weekly water changes in my 40 gallon tank, and between changes I use this to maintain the pH at or around 7.0. My pH will drop to about 6.7 and this brings it back to 7.0, and then by the next water change it will be about 6.7 again until I change the water. This isn't meant to keep your tank at 7.0 forever, but it works great to help maintain a healthy aquarium.If you find that this doesn't dissolve in the aquarium or it leaves the water cloudy you can dissolve it in water before putting it in the tank. I don't mind the cloudiness because when used in the recommended amounts it only stays cloudy for about 15-20 min as it dissipates into the water. I really don't see any reason why this would harm your filtration media when used properly. If anything the particles would get stopped in the filtration media which reduces the cloudiness as it continues to dissipate.",fish aquatic pets,4
"This is one of the simplest, most ingenious aquarium supplies I own. Every time I look at it, it makes me wonder why I hadn't thought of the concept; it seems like something I would have. xD I found it a couple of years ago at one specific fish store, and haven't seen it any other shop or catalog before or since. Which is strange, considering how good it is. My regular handled algae scraper is a pain; of course you get wet trying to reach below a certain point of my vertical 55-gallon tank. Plus, for some unfathomable reason, the handle is hollow, which means it fills with water, and then spills it all over. This product scrapes algae well, but I've never had a problem with it scratching my glass (obviously, according to others, it's not good for acrylic tanks...unfortunately. Hopefully they'll come out with one designed for those.)My only complaint about the thing is that it needs a stronger magnet. It would be good to be able to move it more quickly in any direction without the inside piece floating away, in which case you've got to quickly try to attract it back with the outside half, or else have to manually drag it back to the side to reconnect them before the filter current carries the scraper half off again. Also, since my tank is vertical and hexagonal in shape (an extremely inconvenient style as far as cleaning goes, but my parents bought it when I was very little and hadn't really thought of that) and can't be walked completely around, there are six corners--and you need to move carefully from one glass panel to another. Corners, gravel, objects--they can all cause it to separate. Especially in mine, because again, the parts towards the back and next to our walls can be hard to reach.The only other downside would be if you had something on the outside of the glass that would need to be removed in order to use it. Also, it's obviously only good for cleaning the glass--but you wouldn't really expect it to be able to do anything else in the aquarium!But on the whole, I'm really happy with the little thing. Just plop it in, drag it across the glass, take it out, dry it, put it away! And I have the small Mag-Float (it was the only size available in the store), which will work perfectly on any size aquarium.",fish aquatic pets,4
"I began using this harness with my Spanador (Cocker Spaniel and Lab mix) when she was a puppy (now 1 year old). I used this because I did not know how to train her properly and heel during walks in the neighborhood and my dog walker was also having trouble. I like the harness because it does keep her at my side and automatically turns her when I need to correct her. Now that I have started training classes, I have not used it and have been using the choke collar. It depends on your dog. Honestly, I believe that the harness works just as well, if not better than the choke collar with my breed. It really depends on your breed. If you plan on training your dog, than ask your trainer and research your breed. My dog still pulls and will choke herself at the sight of a squirrel or another puppy with 100-degree weather. Know your breed. Enough advice, the product does what it says.",dogs,3
I purchased animal clippers and these combs were a recommended add-on. I took the bait and tried to use them with the clippers. They are good quality and fit well on the clippers however they make the shaving efforts cumbersome and difficult.

She cannot get her paws around the handle and has a difficult time putting a ball in the sling and using the bungee cord with her mouth.I instead have to use the toy and she is stuck just retrieving the balls.

"The motor which moves the Littermaid's rake is not strong enough to get through the litter. I have been careful not to overfill &amp; to use premium clumping litter. The rake also has a tendency to get stuck on a seam in the plastic floor of the box.As a result, I leave the Power off &amp; run the rake twice a day. This means I have to monitor it. When the litter starts to bunch up too much in front or in back of the rake, I actually tilt the box so that the litter runs contraflow to the rake &amp; stops creating resistance.Yes, I'm a little embarrassed now that I wrote that. Certainly it would be easier to just scoop the litter. I now spend more time &quot;assisting&quot; my Littermaid box than I ever did with a plain litter box.As far as smell goes, previously I would dispose of every scooping immediately in a little plastic bag, which then went directly to the garbage can outside. Having that covered waste receptacle on the side of the box isn't exactly a step up, but that shouldn't be hard to figure out.I suppose I will go back to a plain plastic box; it was easier &amp; less smelly.

"I'll spare you the details since my kitty was enduring much the same ""no-pee"" ""red-pee"" issues as the rest in these reviews. Just wanted to provide a quick tip.While no one actually mentions this on any of the websites, it is WORLDS easier to dose your kitties if you dissolve the required dosage in a bit of water first instead of trying to get them to keep the little pellets in their mouths. Plus, you don't have to feed them all the time (every 30 minutes? come on people... when your animals are in pain they aren't typically interested in eating - well not all of them anyway. Plus you run the risk of counterproductivity if you are feeding them food that has a high pH and you are contributing to potential weight gain issues).Use about 1 tsp of water, mix in your pinch of UIT-Free (double the water and double the pinch for larger animals or use whatever dose is necessary), stir and allow to fully dissolve, suck up in syringe/dropper and dose kitty/puppy without hassle!!Hope it helps!",cats,2

"I made the mistake of purchasing two of these carriers (one large size, one smaller size) for my cats. I would never recommend them! I transported my larger cat (she weighs 16 lbs) to the vet in the large size carrier. While there was plenty of room for her, it was not stable enough to transport her safely. She had torn two holes in the mesh side by the time I got there. The vet's office is less than 3 miles from my home. The second problem was that the bottom of this carrier did not provide enough support for my cat. As I carried her, the bottom of the carrier bulged underneath. I ended up not even using the handles--I held the carrier using both arms so I could support the bottom with one arm. The third, and very dangerous, situation was",dogs,3

Rarely works when the dog actually barks (despite following the instructions perfectly). Honestly this piece of junk worked on like one out of 20 barks. Followed the instructions to the T and used the product 100% as directed. It just doesn't work well.

The video and instruction booklet are very easy to understand so don't worry about this too much.It is clear that my dog would rather not have the collar on, however he soon gives up caring because he is so happy that he is on a care free walk.

It's not the picture that is cruel, it's how it is used. Used properly, this allows the dog to learn proper behaviors and discipline. Before I bought this I wrapped it around my arm and pulled rather violently, it left no marks and caused no pain beyond te pinch.Yes, it looks a little nasty, but in reality it is not. Before you pass judgement please look into things first. It's a great collar and one I will always recommend.",dogs,3
"This toy is well-made, but very skimpy. The lamb is very thin and not soft and fluffy. there is a collar on the lamb which could come loose and easily be swallowed. I am re-ordering a much larger toy from the AKC collection, this toy is a disappointment and I do not recommend it.",dogs,3
"I have a australian shepherd that loves toys, she lives for them, she loves to catch and fetch, she isn't much of a chewer. I've tried all varieties of Kong balls and this football is by far her favorite. I give the product five stars because it is exactly as described, the tennis felt is much thicker than regular tennis balls and there is no squeaker pillow inside of this ball, in fact the way it squeaks is at the tip of this ball there is a very small hole and a plastic squeaker is hidden there, so the way the dog makes these squeak is to simply bite down on it, my dog also likes to push down on it with her nose to make it squeak. This toy is not a chew toy, it is a fetch toy. The plush toys with the squeaker pillow are for me a waste of time, Dakota (my dog) can feel the squeaker pillow with her nose and she immediately sets out to get it and destroys the toy. This toy lasts much longer for her enjoyment than any of the others. I noticed other reviewers were upset their dogs destroyed the toy, if you have a big dog bent on destroying something, it's going to be destroyed, so with that in mind, if your dog loves to catch and fetch, and is a larger dog (this toy is fairly big) this may be the toy for your dog. If your dog likes to sit and chew on a toy, this toy is not for your dog.For small dogs, my mom has 3 pomeranians, and they love the small Kong air squeakers Kong Air Squeaker Tennis Ball Dog Toy small yellow-color 2"" diameter 3-count, they push down on them with their noses to squeak them, they last her dogs for months, because her little dogs like to chew on their toys on occasion and they eventually can get the felt off of these.If you have the expectation that your large dog loves to destroy toys and won't be able to destroy this one, it's not a reasonable expectation. These are more durable, they are tougher than regular toys, but they are not indestructible.If you are looking for something on the tough side, I recommend theKONG Ball Dog Toy, Medium/Large, RedKong rubber ball. I had one of these, had left it in the yard, ran over it with the lawn mower, and it stopped my lawn mower in its tracks. The blade went into the ball and got stuck there. I picked up the ball and it had a small slit at the top. These are about as indestructible as dog toys can get. The downside for us was that the toy is simply not a fetch toy, it's too heavy and not really safe for Dakota to jump up and catch in her mouth. It's meant for chewing.I hope this helps to decide if this toy is for you.",dogs,3
"This has been a life-saver since we live CLOSE to an interstate. After having it for about 4 months, the system has worked flawlessly. However, the other day we discovered that our dog's receiver (collar) had been removed. The culprit were the free-roaming neighborhood dogs. They love to come into our yard and play with our dog. Their major way of playing is by grabbing each other by the collar. We couldn't find it so we ordered another. Two days after it came in and had been in use, we found it had been removed again, but this time we found it. So",dogs,3
"Works great. I've been purchasing them through Amazon for around 6 months now. I have found that Amazon is the cheapest place to purchase these filters from (especially compared to local pet stores like Petsmart and Petco). I run my filter with two in at a time, rotating which one I switch every two or three weeks as needed. I have found that doing it this way and not removing both filters at once helps keep stability in the water and puts less stress on the fish as the filters contain good bacteria that keep ammonia down. Have yet to have an issue with them. :)",fish aquatic pets,4

"I have had this bed for over a month now, and it has performed extremly well. We use it on a daily basis in our outdoor kennel, where my 50lb dingo mix and 90lb Bernese mountain dog mix enjoy it. We also have taken it camping , where it is nice to keep the dogs off of the ground and dry. It also has a low enough center of gravity for us to use in the back of our pickup truck without danger of it tipping over. I would highly reccomend this item.",cats,2
"My dog hates it, naturally, but it definitely cuts back on him tugging on the leash. He's a 125 lb german shepherd who thinks he's the boss. The collar gives me control over which way his head is pointed, so it gives me control, keeps him focused on the walk instead of other things going on around us, and keeps him at my side instead of charging ahead of me. It does rub on the bridge of his nose a little tho which seems to be a little uncomfortable for him. I think the more we use it, the better he will accustom to it and we won't have that problem as much.",dogs,3
"Ok, maybe not, but she sure doesn't seem to mind it. The smell is wonderful, it cleans and conditions the hair to silky smooth status (even Zohan would be jealous), it's nice to have it all in one quick step, and I'm thrilled that it's all-natural. I purchased this 2 years ago, bathe our dog once a month, and we still have half a bottle! A little goes a long way and really makes her coat shine. If you own a dog, look no further than Earthbath's Shampoo and Conditioner in One...it's awesome!",dogs,3

"I really think this is a great thing -- wish I'd gotten it long ago. For younger cats, it's perfect. I only pay attention to the sand box every other week, and even then don't have to touch anything really dirty. However, for my old, sickly cat, it's less useful because the cat already has very messy toilet habits, which means taking time to clean up all the outside surfaces of the contraption because the cat misses the box a lot. For him, it's easier to have a regular sandbox made from a cardboard box that I can completely throw out every few weeks. SO now I have both.",cats,2
I really like this tank. I first used it for a few fat little goldfish and later for a betta and some corys. As long as you do not over feed or over load with fish the filtration works well and keeps water very clean although I wish it had undergravel filtration instead. Filtration is quiet and there are spaces in the top for heaters or accessories. One thing to be careful of is scratching the acrylic. I had a problem with algae growth and used one of those magnetic scrapers that didn't feel that abrasive to me but it scratched the acrylic pretty bad. I would recommend this tank to anyone wanting only a handful of fish.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I am a city dweller with two small dogs. The chemicals that most multi-family apartment and condo buildings use on the sidewalks to melt the snow and ice causes my dogs a lot of pain when they walk through it. I used Pawz dog boots pretty successfully these past couple of winters but worried about what my dog sitter would do. I knew she would never be able to get boots on my boys so I ordered Musher's Secret. I have used Musher's Secret for several weeks now, through the worst snow and ice stoms in years - and very heavey salt and chemical applications on the sidewalks. My dogs haven't had any problem walking through the salt and chemicals at all. This is a wonderful product and is a great time saver since it goes on faster than their boots! I don't notice much residue on my wood floors - just a bit that wipes off with soft cloth. I never thought my boys could go bare foot in the winter time in the city! Thanks Musher's Secret for a product that really works!!",cats,2

"I bought the Furminator at the recommendation of my Vet. And it really does work. I have a large german shepherd mix, and a small short haired black and white mutt. So there is not a color of clothing that you can wear that you aren't going to end up with hair showing. But with regular brushing (about twice a week, cause I am lazy) the shedding has decreased dramatically, even when my german shepherd blows his coat. And my vacuum doesn't have to be emptied as often. I call that a success. Definitely better than the brush I used before.",cats,2
I literally almost throw up everytime I open the bag. I figured I'd give these a shot because they are all natural blah blah blah. My dog doesn't seem to care for these over any other treat and the only difference to me isother treats don't make me gag! I'm sticking to beggin strips.,dogs,3

"I purchased this product nearly two years ago. On and off over the last two years, I've let my golden play with it but would put it away for a while as all he did was try to destroy it. About 5 months ago, when I finally gave it over to him to play with at his leisure, he was determined to destroy it. Three months ago, he finally shredded it and I threw it away.Fast forward to this past Monday. My golden threw up a piece of it and began vomitting for 2 days. Today, the vet did exploratory surgery and found a large chunk of the toy in his small intestines. They removed a section of his intestines and now I'm waiting to see how he recovers.This toy is NOT indestructible, and when it tears up, it tears up in large, odd-shaped pieces, which can easily get stuck in their digestive tract.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",dogs,3
"My husband and I currently own a 3 year old, 135 pound Great Dame. She tore BOTH her ACLs and has had her first surgery 5 weeks ago. My husband has a 90's Jeep and I have a 2007 Ford Escape. He was tiring and hurting his back having to lift her to all our appointments. Finally we saw someone using an item such as this at the vet clinic. We have had it only three weeks and it is a 100% necessity! It is a bit more of a steep incline for my car but as long as you have two people on either side, she still gets up with a bit of a muster. We also use this for our front door (we have one step from our porch to our outdoor walk way) and she is now use to it. I see that others mention it is heavy... well not has heavy as a Great Dane... and it is good way to build some muscle! It does take up quite a bit of room in the car YET it is easy to fold and carry like a briefcase. You wont regret this item!!",dogs,3
"If anything this has been the perfect bribe for my long haired cat to sit for me for daily grooming, which reportedly also helps cut back on the infernal hairballs. She patiently endures my brushing while looking lovingly at the grass gel in anticipation. The package directions suggest you serve the gel from your finger but that's probably not the best association for her to have, don't you think? I use a spoon. And although the science of hairball eradication doesn't seem like an exact one to me, after a few months of use I can say that the problem has gone from regular to occasional, to almost never. The almost is what keeps me from giving it 5 stars. I'm sure there's a lot more involved in the process of hair ingesting and passing than this product can address but It has kept my cat from costly vet visits. And that is a very good thing.",cats,2
"My 2 yr old golden destroyed the ball in 1 day. She was able to pull it apart at the opening on the tip of the football. She hasn't been able to destroy the Planet Dog snowball, diamond plated ball or glow in the dark orbee. The 5 chomper rating seems to be pretty accurate with these toys. The football was a 4 chomper. The football is a good outdoor retrieving toy, but not good for constant chewing.",dogs,3

"My cat is obsessed with this toy, he will lay beside it and stare at it until I turn it on.This item does not hold up to normal cat wear & tear. We probably buy one every 3-4 months. They break frequently. My cat likes to hold on to the toy attached to the wand for a good amount of time once he catches it. I know they are not supposed to do this, but as another reviewer wrote- my cat cannot read the instructions. I gave it 3 stars beacause my cat cannot live without this toy. The company does have quite the racket. They make sub-par toys that your cats make you replace.",cats,2
"This was easy to setup and doesn't weigh a ton. The only problem I have with it is that there are sharp protrusions across the top of the kennel. I ran my hand across the top and sliced my hand open from one of the sharp parts. Other than that, the kennel is great.",dogs,3

Only complaint is there is not a size for a toy poodle that also pulls. Going to buy another one as a back up.,dogs,3

Out of about 300 bags used so far, I think I've torn 2 or 3 when trying to rip one off or open one. Not too bad.Our dog is about 70 lbs, and they can hold his business and still be tied shut. I've only had to use two bags a couple times... but that's really the dog's issue and not the manufacturer's problem, lol.",dogs,3

Making it up can be a hassle, but I think the positives far outweigh the negatives.In case anyone cares, this is how I prepare it. I follow the included directions for quantities, but I use ground beef for the protein portion. I put a dozen eggs in the blender(shell and all) and add that to the ground beef and some bread scraps. I cook them as meatballs. I weigh everything out and portion out ten days worth at a time. Half goes in the freezer, half in the fridge. For oil I use Grizzly Alaskan Salmon Oil.If you can afford it, this is the way to go. Good luck",cats,2
"After reading other reviews, and since my kitties are on the hefty side - I installed the window perch with the screws and didn't even try the velcro. This worked great. It is just two screws that secure the perch to the sill. The supports under the perch are not screwed into the wall - they are just there by pressure. Note to those installing this - be sure to give yourself enough room on the window side - to get the cover on and off. I first installed it too close to the window and realized I wouldn't be able to get the cover on. My cats love this seat - so I am actually ordering another one for another window.",cats,2

Therefore, there is no way to tell if it actually works or if the battery is still charged except to walk around the yard and listen for the tone.

Other than that the collar seems to work as it should but it only been a few weeks.",dogs,3

By the second day however, the shock no longer deterred her. She'll even stand there in the kitchen, and you can see her muscle twitching and it doesn't seem to phase her at all.

"I was skeptical that a tiny brush really could remove as much hair as the pictures show. I purchased a medium furminator for our three cats and am truly amazed by how much it reduces shedding! Apparently, the furminator removes loose hairs, perfect for pets who shed frequently. One of our cats loves being brushed with this, one of them either loves or hates it depending on his mood, and the last one thinks it's a toy and tries to play with it while you're brushing him. So, all in all, we usually use it on only one of our cats, but he sheds the most. This also gathers pet hair on certain fabrics. Just don't rake it on your animal's skin! I would definitely recommend this awesome tool to anyone with a pet!",cats,2
"The ""old"" Drinkwell pet fountain was a single unit (not a detachable container for the water). I used a pitcher to fill it up as the water level decreased. It was relatively easy to clean, as it was one piece. We used that fountain for years.....as our cat aged, vision & hearing declined, and she didn't like the fountain type drinker as we think she couldn't see all that well, and would get a face full, when searching for the water.With two younger cats now, (both boys suffering from crystaluria), we needed to increase their water intake.I searched for a new fountain, and this is what I thought was top of the line.The cats seem to like drinking out of it. The dog is a bit unsure, even after a few months.The unbearable part about this is detachable unit is that when the pump is running, it makes an annoying HUM....that never ends. The lower the level of the water, the louder the HUM is. Even when completely full, that HUM is still there......a different tone, but it just goes on and on.The detachable unit needs a brush to clean the inside, which adds to the cleaning time -- which I feel is a negative, as well.After 3-4 months, I am sick of hearing it & just unplugged the thing about a week ago. I'm debating whether to try & return it (which I probably will at $50+ dollars), or just toss it in the trash....",cats,2

"I understand that all dogs react differently to different medications, but a few hours after I gave my dog his first dose he began to act differently. Instead of being the friendly, playful dog he usually is, he only wanted to be alone and secluded himself. After another few hours and by the end of the day he would not walk as if it hurt him to walk. He chewed and scratched all day where the medication had been applied as well as his paws. It scared me badly but after some research I realized it was an allergic reaction, I'm glad it was nothing more serious because it was a saturday night and the next day was a sunday and almost all the pet clinics were closed except for some far away. Within a couple of days and after a bit of benadryl he was fine and I'm very grateful, but we can no longer use this product and my money has gone to waste.",dogs,3

"The best way to use a harness with a D-Ring on the chest is to attach the leash to the d-ring on the harness and also the d-ring on the dogs collar. I had a harness similar and that was the recomended use by a trainer, forgot the brand name. When attached in this manner if the dog slips out of the harness he still is attached at the collar. You might think attaching it to the collar is defeating the purpose of the harness but it does not. The harness keeps the collar d-ring on the underside of the dogs neck and allows you better control over the dog. Without the harness the dogs collar and leash rotates to the back of his head and when the dog pulls you have little control. So if the front strap of the harness is loose enough give this method a try and see how it works out for you.",dogs,3

"This leash is very light weight and has very smooth action. It also features a lock button and a lock set button that both work well. However, this tape measure style leash is very thin. I only had it 5 days before the cord snapped. All of the damage was inflicted during the occasional bites whenever the leash gets wrapped around my dog or a pole. The ribbon becomes tattered very quickly from the bites and then snaps. I would not recommend using this leash until your dog is completely disciplined to not snap at the leash.",dogs,3

"It's ok, but I thought I was getting a much heavier cable than what I actually got, so I feel it is slightly misrepresented. Also, it does not have the spring on it as shown in the picture, but that is ok because I never really liked the spring on the tie out I had before (similar to this one, but with red coating) that broke. This one would be better suited for my 30 lb. beagle than it is for my Leonberger, but since she doesn't pull on it at all, it works ok for her. My 30 lb beagle pulls a lot and is strong for his size, and this one would be ok for him. If you have a large dog, say, over 60 lbs that pulls on the cable, you will want a stronger cable than this one. The beagle pulls a lot and this size would be better suited for him than the one I first bought for him. These tie outs require constant supervision, because no matter what they advertise, they are NOT tangle free.",dogs,3

Once the mat is loosen, I will pick at the sides of the mats and pull a few hairs from the mats and slowly come to the center of the tangle to remove the mat. It also helps a lot if you put a little conditioner into the mat so the hairs are slippery when they are pulled.The spacing of the tines of the comb come in handy for removing the very small knots that cannot be removed with a wide spaced comb.

It arrived in perfect condition. It took me about 5 minutes to unpack the crate and set it up. It is of good quality materials and construction and up to date, very durable. The double doors are very handy. I have placed a variety of dog mats, pillows, etc. in there for my dog. It is large enough to accommodate a variety of pet bedding. My Boxer stands almost two feet tall and weighs in at seventy pounds. There is more than enough room for him in this crate (42"" X 28""). I leave the door open and he uses this as his day bed. It is a handy place to locate his play toys, bones, etc. when he is not playing with them. It came with a partition but I have no use for it. I imagine the partition would be handy for smaller dogs, puppies, or perhaps to co-locate two or more dogs within the same crate. As Champ the Wonder Dog is comfortable in his ""home"", leaving him in there for up to four hours at a time while no one is home seems to suit him fine. He is crashed out in there now as I review this item. I would recommend this item to anyone that has a need for one. I would also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon.com as they have the best price and prompt shipping. I am certain you dog will be happy with his new home.",dogs,3
"My betta (a.k.a. Mr. Ed) seems to enjoy this food with no problems. I give him a tiny pinch of these flakes daily, and he seems contented. It is possible that this food may contribute to making the tank water a little bit cloudy. However, at most, this is a trivial problem. (Show me a fish food that actually DOESN'T contribute to making tank water cloudy)! I've read some internet comments claiming that bettas generally dislike flake food and should be fed more expensive brands of pellet food; I can't say that I really agree with this concept. Just like any other pet, if you feed them overpriced extravagant food, they will most likely become spoiled, finicky eaters. This betta flake food is cost effective and nutritionally balanced specifically for bettas. Moreover, since Mr. Ed seems happy and is continually building large ""bubble nests,"" why would I want to cause a potential disruption with a change to a ""better"" food?",fish aquatic pets,4

I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing 2 of these bark collars. I agree totally that the collar won't stay in place so it can't detect vibration from the dog's vocal cords.

"I bought this from PetsMart for about eight dollars. Even with the water set to the absolute lowest pressure, this thing hisses loudly. I put pillpockets on it to get my dog to drink. He licked it once and ran. I loosened the thread to make it leak and left him out there in the heat for a bit. I think he might have gone to it, but I let him in after ten minutes or so. The water was spraying on the house, so my wife has suggested jamming the device into the open position, so it just runs out the bottom. She's suggested pulling back the ""bead"" with some heavy wire tied to the spout. We could leave it running for like a day or something, with a large bowl under it -- keep water off the house or a muddy pool from forming. We'll give that a try, and see if he will come around.

"Finally a gadget that really does work!After having my first cat for two weeks I tired very quickly of changing the litter box. I paid $100 for this product and it has worked quite well. It has has been reliable and cost effective. Make sure you do use good clumping litter and the practice of putting a cheap piece of carpet and maybe dustbuster nearby are good ideas for small litter spillage. The plastic containers arent cheap but are reusable. I like the suggestion of a small garbage bag as a liner. I will try that. I also like the suggestion of spraying a thin layer of silicone at the bottom to ease with material that might stick to the bottom or the rake itself. I also suggest putting small amount of baking soda in the litter and the plastic receptacle itself (Easily scraped off)Small fecal pieces can escape the raking process, but the rake reliably gets everything else I would give this product a rating of B+ or A-. Its not always 100% perfect but after four years, I couldnt imagine having a cat without it.",cats,2

"This handy blacklight has been very useful in detecting where my girlfriend's cat has most recently decided to foul of our apartment. My girlfriend's cat has it out for me. The cat loves to pee in various parts of our living room and after cleaning multiple areas, I didn't know why I could still smell pee! After turning on this device at night, it was quite obvious what spots I had missed. With that information, I was able to clean up the remaining spots and hopefully we won't have any more issues moving forward.In addition to helping detect cat pee, the light was very useful in helping to point out what other areas of our apartment needed cleaning desperately. It illuminates all kinds of stains that you wouldn't normally see. In fact, it may be a little too much information for some people since it shows EVERYTHING. This would have been very handy to use before moving in so we could have had a good idea how clean the apartment was in the first place.

"We bought this crate to replace a soft-sided crate that we had before. Our dog scratched his way through the front of the soft-sided crate and that was the end of that. We're currently on a road trip with the Midwest crate and it has been fantastic! Setup and teardown are a breeze. When we drive, our miniature schnauzer, Henry, rides in the back seat, so we just use the optional fleece bed. When we arrive at our destination, we set up the crate and put the bed in it and he instantly has a safe spot that he's familiar with. In fact, he's sleeping there now!If we have to leave him for a while, we just latch the door and know he'll be safe and won't scratch at the door or get into something he shouldn't. At a hotel, I like the idea that he wouldn't surprise a maid that might enter our room while we're out. It's also reassuring to know that he wouldn't be able to get out if the room door were opened.This size crate (30x21x24) seems ideal for him, a 20# dog. The construction is very good and makes the weight of the crate very manageable.",dogs,3

"I was excited when I received this product, they are nice size and made very durable. I followed directions and added a few drops of dish-soap to the mote and added food and water. I checked it the next morning and it was full of ants!!! What I found was a simple flaw or defect that allowed the ants to get in.. In between the two bowls on the unit there is the piece that separates the bowls and it has a small hole maybe about double size of a pen tip.. This allowed the ants to get in from under the bowl.. Both sets I ordered had this defect.. It looks like it is from part of the manufacturing process, but it was easy to fix with a bit of glue or maybe silicone caulking would work.. Once I sealed the holes they work wonderful.. It is still worth buying, but I hope they fix their process so we don't have to fix it at home..",cats,2

"My overweight cat was on a diet and was becoming very demanding and obsessive about asking us to be fed. So we thought we would try an automatic feeder to see if it could break this cycle by giving her more frequent feedings and having her no longer think of us as a food source. In the end, it worked and we are happy with our purchase.The feeder is a bit difficult to set up but it was much easier than I feared because it turned out that a mount was not needed. Our cat isn't one of the ""criminal masterminds"" discussed in other reviews who try to attack the feeder to get extra food. We were able to simply snap the pieces of the feeder together and set it on a book placed next to her bowl. We used none of the screws or mounting brackets included in the package, nor any additional hardware.Because our cat is on a diet, we needed the feeder to dispense a precisely measured amount of food. This was more difficult than I had hoped. Even after much experimentation with the various settings on the feeder and exchanging emails with the manufacturer, I was unable to get it to dispense food with the accuracy my cat needed (she is a very small cat and daily variations of even 0.1 oz would be too much). Sometimes just a few kibbles would come out, sometimes it would ""hit the jackpot"" like a slot machine and spill out several times as much. The variation was so wide that it didn't average out, even over a dozen feedings. It seems that the variation was caused by the shape of the food we were using",cats,2
My cat hates taking any type of medication. We've tried sprinkling it into food but he can taste it and won't eat his food. Once we've heard about Greenies Pill Pockets we had to get them.

"I began using these with my cat over a week ago and they have worked out better than expected so far. My cat does not scratch at things intentionally (except her scratching post) but I am using them for the unintentional scratches & punctures from her front & rear claws. They were relatively easy to apply and my cat doesn't seem to mind them. However, my cat is typically quite laid back and is good at just ""going with the flow"". She was already used to having her nails trimmed. The instructions give a good tip in advising to fill 10 nails with glue and then pop them on in succession. My cat has lost 3 of the caps in the 1+ week she has had them. However, I'm pretty sure it was in my application (not enough glue) and not due to the caps or her pulling them off. The back claws seem to need a little more glue because those claws are shorter & stubbier. I have not had any ill side effects (glue in hair, messed up / bloody nails, etc) that are mentioned by others.",cats,2

"I started giving Program tablets to my dog late summer / early fall last year. I had been using Capstar (which works miraculously but is too expensive to use daily as a stand alone) and read many reviews and articles stating how great Capstar and Program are when used together.My dog has allergies (nasal and sometimes skin). Her hair started thinning out a little in the back and I just figured it had to do with her skin allergies. It very slowly kept getting worse. I have been trying over and over to figure out if there was something that could have been causing this, I realized it started after giving the Program tablets. I skpped the past month's tablet and hopefully her hair will grow back in. Can't decide on a monthly to use on her, because Frontline Plus gives her hives on her belly. I will continue to use Capstar as needed (a couple times a week or whenever she plays with the neighbor's dog or grass is long/wet and itching starts).I'm not saying it is a problem for all dogs, but it did cause the hair loss on my dog. This may not be a common side effect, but I can't recommend it to others because of this.",dogs,3
My two guinea pigs didn't have a problem eating from this hay holder but I wouldn't say it's the best thing out there. I recently replaced it with a hay manger but I had the ball attached to the side of the cage. There would always be a mess underneath the holder there was hardly a point in having one. The door also wouldn't stay shut and my guinea pig would just stick her head in there and eat which could be dangerous. Putting the hay on the bottom of the cage is almost the same as using this product.,bunny rabbit central,1

It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours, which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last.Update",dogs,3

"We searched everywhere for something to keep our chew happy 1 year old German Shorthair occupied. The Kong only held up for a few weeks and never held enough treats to keep him entertained for more than 5 minutes. The Buster Block only slid on our hardwood floors.

Our Pointer plays with it inside and out for 30-45 minutes at a time. It took about 10 minutes to teach him to roll it with his paw or nose. This was easy to do by nudging it with my foot a few times. Once he realized the nudging meant goodies he was all about it. When it's empty or mostly empty, he usually picks it up and brings it to us or moves on to running circles around the house. It is the best $12 we have spent! So far, 6 months with minimal wear. We still keep bones around for chewing too.",dogs,3

We've had it for five days now and Teddy still looks like new and the squeaker is great. My schnauzer has pretty much claimed it as her toy and she loves to make it squeak, she throws it in the air and chases it, and occasionally enjoys a game of tug-of-war with Teddy in the middle.

My two angels also grew drastically after I began using it, even though they had been crawling along in development prior. Could be coincidence, but who knows!

"We rescued an 8 mo old Cavalier Spaniel with juvenile cataracts (she was scheduled for euthanasia); thinking we'd have the cataract surgery for her. An opth. specialist did not feel she was a good candidate, so we tried Ocluvet with his blessing (he did not recommend it, saying he couldn't advocate a medication that no double blind studies had been done). All of us thought ""it's worth a shot"". Four months of three times a day instillation later, the specialist rechecked her and was amazed. States, ""I won't endorse this product, but I will tell you that I could NOT visualize her optic nerve before, and now I can; use it once a day now, and call me if you notice the cloudiness worsening. Before it was as though she was looking through the bottom of a Coke bottle; now, it's akin to her looking through a spider-crack in the windshield. The cataracts are not gone, but they are fragmented."" From what I could see (and I am a nurse), the cloudiness, while not gone, is MUCH smaller. When we take pics of her, there is the redness of the flashback of the retina, which wasn't present on pics before using the Rx. The cost is worth the results we are seeing, so far. (and avoiding an invasive surgery that probably wouldn't work for her) We'd have to buy 20 bottles to equal the cost of surgery for one cataract, and she has one in each eye. It's worth a shot. Follow up with an opth. specialist to check the results for your pet. I'm elated, and the specialist is pleased with the results, although he won't attribute the improvement to the Rx. (The only other change we made was adding more betacarotene to her diet, carrots and sweet potato, daily)We will continue the drops and eye check ups.OcluVet Eye Drops 15ml",dogs,3

I'm taking the rest back and will never purchase this brand again. What a shame, their website really got me to believe it was tasty, healthy food. After doing some research, found there are mentions on the web about 2 recalls recently involving Natural Balance and many others with similar complaints about cats not liking the taste.One review I read elsewhere summed it up perfectly, ""Even if this food is actually healthy, what's the point in serving it if my cat won't eat it?"".",cats,2

It removes a lot more loose fur than her previous brushes and I now have a lot less fur flying around the house from unscheduled shedding.After her jaundice, she no longer liked being brushed on the tummy with her previous brushes, (I think she is still very sensitive) but she lets me brush her with this particular brush.So for us this brush has beena huge success.",cats,2

"Bought this for my puppy since I remembered our dog playing with my daughter's bumble ball 20 years ago. Puppy loves it; I am not sure it has the same &#34;umph&#34; that the old one had, but it could be that I just don't accurately recall the last one.",dogs,3
"Most dog toys life can be measured in minutes in our house, these really stand up. This one was ordered as a back up for one we have had for a couple of years and is finally starting to wear out. Well worth the extra $ for the much longer life span.",dogs,3

"Tuffy, my Dachshund, loves car rides. He is a rescue that I got in November 2009, so I try to do as many things as possible to make him happy in his new home. So every day he gets to go for a car ride to check the mail, go to the market or whatever.Before getting this seat Tuffy would love to sit on my lap. While that's not illegal yet (the Governator vetoed a bunch of laws that the ""no dogs on laps"" law was appended, so it did not pass.)Anyway, I had my eye on the Lookout 2 seat for about a month. A couple days ago I took the plunge (Was about $125 with tax at a local pet store. Ouch).Bonus Tip",dogs,3
"I have a 3 yr old dog with skin allergies. When she was a puppy it took us months to find out what kind of allergies she had and why she was going bald. I was told over and over that I would have to give her additional supplements in order to clear her allergies. A friend of mine suggested that we try Canidae and we did the mix for a week - 2 weeks so her stomach would not get upset, but in 2 weeks after we were only giving her the Canidae, we seen a huge improvement. He has not had any additional problems at all and it has been 2+ years. When Canidae came out with the Lamb Meal formula I switched her to that, finding that the Lamb agrees with her system better, and we and her could not be happier. With the Canidae her body uses more of the food there for she does not need to eat as much or go out to potty near as much. To make things even better she really loves the food as well.I am a really happy user of the Canidae, and my girl is proof that it is great for the skin and coat. I do not have any plans of changing her food unless Canidae changes their formula. Thanks Canidae!!!!!!!!!!",cats,2
"Had a unit that was extremely loud and shook whatever surface you put it on. Husband looked up this model online and saw the great reviews so we went and picked one up as soon as we could. Since then, all we've heard is the bubbles breaking the surface. The pump has sound dampeners inside of it and is securely sitting in a rubber dome with feet. This design truly works! Can't hear a thing (and hasn't even vibrated itself off the self either). It also came with an air regulator since this pump can be used for any size up to 10 gallons, you can adjust for the smaller tanks. Highly recommend it!",fish aquatic pets,4
"Tough inter~action toy! It offers dogs and cats the opportunity to challenge their intellect while it holds their interest. The only toy our Aussie has not chewed up. He always knows where it is and always wants to play with it. We have 2 large dogs, 4 small, 3 cats that inclusively enjoy playing with this toy!",cats,2
"Do watch the little plastic nubs that get chewed off rather quickly. Probably digested easily, but I pull them off when I can. Possibly what made the other dog in the reviews ill. I take them away when they get too chewed. My golden is a good chewer and these (both sizes) are among his favorites.",dogs,3

this pooper scooper is not very good. the spring action is very soft. it doesn't do well in tall grass. it doesn't close all the way with poop in it. it will get the job done if you don't mine picking up the same poop in 2-3 attempts.,dogs,3

"We've had this bone for about a year now, with my 70 lb. Labrador only using it occasionally. She preferred her Nylabone Nylaknot to this one, probably because the larger end is harder for her to get her mouth around. She still likes it, and it has proven to be fairly indestructible. I haven't seen any chunks break off like some of the smaller chews we've tried. Great Product.",dogs,3
"Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-OunceOur six year old Rottweiler is an extremely picky eater for some reason and we've gone through no less than six different brands of treats over the past year and this finally hit the spot.We changed from mass produced big brand treats to healthier natural ones about a year ago and maybe it's just me but I see a real difference in energy when playing. He simply loves these. They are pricey so we tend to be less ready to give treats but when we do it's great. I'm almost tempted to try one.Very pleased with the response thus fur. Will be getting more soon.",dogs,3

"I have never written a review before, but I had to for this product! My cat was going to the bathroom in every room of my house. My husband was so angry with me and my cat tht he was ready to lose his mind. My vet recommended this product to me and it is AMAZING! She has not had one accident since I started using this litter. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to train their cat or kitten!",cats,2
"This product works wonderfully to clear up tear stains. Now the down side, my dog doesn't like the powder I have to trick her into eating it. It sure would be good if it could be put in tablet form. Maisie likes her vitamins and takes tablets really good.",dogs,3
"I use this exact comb on my cat, 2 short hair dogs, and a big fluffy dog too!! None of them have ever really enjoyed being brushed, but with this they don't seem to mind so much and it really does a FABULOUS job of getting rid of all the loose hair. Just be prepared w/lots of trash bags!!! :)",cats,2
"This is amazing. I was reluctant to spend this kind of money on a catbox, but my cat was about to be slaughtered from all of the litter he drug all over the house. I swear he grabbed paw fulls and sprinkled it all over the house. Now, there is litter on the floor, but it's right beside the box. The way he ""jumps out"" of this must be the only way to get him to let go of the litter stuck to his feet. truly saved my cat's life! LOL",cats,2
These help with the look of the cool beds and are thin enough to offer comfort for the dog but THEY SHRINK! We washed in cold and it did not matter. Buy more than 1 to be safe!,dogs,3

"Hey aquarium lovers novice, you need to get this test kit.I started back in november , 2006 and killed a lot of fishes andwasted a bunch of dollars. Now I can monitor the ammonia every otherday and do the 20% water as needed. Usually it's every other day.U must also buy the 25ft or 50ft python for cleaning your gravel . The fish waste and uneaten food can be removed by the python.",fish aquatic pets,4
seriously these are amazing. You can blow and blow and blow and the bubbles keep coming. Plus they never dry out and you get a ton for your money. These bubbles also do not pop on their own but just keep on going. My kids love them!,cats,2

This Feline Pine is fantastic. There is no odor and it cleans up neatly. It just melds into a fine clump. I use the big scoop you can get for free with their points program. Finally there is hope for cat litter.,cats,2
"This is truly wonderful stuff! For whatever reason, our two cats had picked a spot on the dining room carpet to vent their ire. Since using this product, there haven't been any uh-ohs. On the advice of earlier revieweres and the bottle, I used about half of the bottle on the rug. Needless to say, the house smells better, too! This is a product that I want to always keep on hand--just in case.",dogs,3
"Without looking at it closely, I bought this as a replacement to my existing 8 year old Flexi leash. The one I was replacing has the ribbon style leader which leads into a rope. I wish I had bought the same one I had previously.This leash:- Smooth action- No lead, so it will retract basically all the way (so no matter how close the dog is, it will pull your hand/arm towards the dog)- The ""STOPPER"" for the ribbon is not as strong as the stopper for the rope version- Made pretty well, even though the metal looking cover on the stopper disappeared on the first walk",dogs,3
"Frontline receives great reviews but it did not work on 2 of my dogs in the least. I used Frontline a few years ago on my first dog (a Border Collie)... it did NOT work at all. Flash forward 6 years to my current pooch, a Whippet. He has short, white hair and skinny so an easy guy to care for regarding fleas. I ran out of Advantage flea drops (has always worked excellent!) and thought Id revisit Frontline since reviews are so good. And again, the drops did less than nothing. Very disappointed. Go with Advantage.Details",dogs,3
We have two APBT mixes and they both can destroy chews and toys in short order. These may not be the most fun toy for them but when they are in a chewing mood these really hold up and occupy them without suffering too much damage.,dogs,3
"It is so cute its movement is sporadic like a fly ! My Cat loves it! I love it too because he is so cute as he's playing with it. Great toy at a great Price! Definitely recommend. Don't let its simplicity fool you - my cat goes nuts over this! Like any other toy you let your cat play with, you should first check it and supervise there play. I do not leave toys out except for a select few, everything else gets put away when Stashu is done playing with it. This wire is a nice heavy wire with cardboard on the ends. Just keep an eye on the wire ends and look for wear and tear. It tells you right on the packaging to throw it away when it gets worn. The best thing is its Sporadic Fly Movement!!! And Bouncy too! Too Cute!",cats,2
This is a wonderful product. my dog would bark all night before this. It only had to go up 3 levels before she stopped barking. I only put it on her at night for about a week and now when she barks all I have to do is show her the collar and she stops.,dogs,3
"I have a bengal striped cat who especially loves greenies. Recently, he got sinus trouble, so I got the Sinu-rite here at Amazon. I needed something to get that free shipping, so I got the pill pockets.The pill pockets were made perfectly for those little pills",cats,2
I haven using Urine Off for years. I have a cat that has been marking in my house for a long time (8years). I almost lost hope and then my vet suggested I put him on Reconcile (prozac for cats). I tried the transdermal version and it did not work. I then tried the pill version (8MG) and it is working wonders. No more marking. It has been a year now and I am so happy. I am able to give him the pill with a pill pocket (buy at per store). He no longer marks in the house. Try it - it really works. Just be sure that the meds are delivered every day as if you miss a few days the behavior will start up again. i am so happy that i have my home back and still have my cat. Urine off has also been great.,cats,2
"We bought this XL bed for our two pointers to share on the back deck of our house. They love it. If it is a bit cold but sunny we put a couple of fleecy mats on it, in warm weather they just sleep on the canvas. They are so much more comfortable than they were with just the mats on the wood deck. Although you can leave it out in the rain we bring it in just to keep it nicer. It is so lightweight it is easy to carrry. We are all (people and dogs) very happy with this bed!",dogs,3
"This would be good for maybe an overweight basset (or even a regular weight basset probably). I got this in an effort to keep my setter from chewing on her stitches and various other places after her surgery.The chewing was a new problem for her and I was hoping that something to prevent her from getting to her preferred chew places while the steroids worked would be useful. The e-collar the vet gave her was too large and not only gave her the impression she could not get through the doggy door but also made her a danger to self and others as she knocked over stacks of books and hit others behind the knees on the stairs.The E-J Collar fit fine and prevented her from getting to her stitches on her belly and the place on her mid back that she was chewing all of the hair off; however, she was able to get to the place around her tail due to the fact she was thin and flexible. So if you have the right dog this is far better than an e-collar and sturdy. The velcro and foam on the collar collect longish dog hair like you wouldn't believe. It now looks white instead of black due to this.Do use the provided band to stabilize it.",dogs,3
"That's exactly what it is, cheap junk but fun while it lasted until I needed to replace the batteries and read the printed label. The batteries pre-installed lasted less than three hours total of play time. The laser dot had a ring around it which the cat was distracted by. I didn't recognize the item because it was all purple with no logo, so I have no idea if this is truly what I ordered. No pouch was included.No big deal until I needed to replace the batteries and read the label that was glued on the battery cover. It stated, ""DANGER avoid exposure; laser radiation is emitted from this aperture. Manufactured in August 2009"" (more than 2 years ago). I got what I paid for and nuked myself and my cat! I don't know how an item can be sold when it specifically states to avoid using it. I tried to research how much radiation could possibly be emitted but had no luck.",cats,2
"Fence works good! Instructions are easy enough to figure out and for the price, its a good deal! I have a .25 acre lot and the 500 ft went all the way around the outside.

"I tried a few products like this to give our border collie a mental ""workout"" at meal times. This particular ball didn't top our list, but it isn't bad.The trick treat ball is a little too light for what I'd like. My collie lifts it right up and carries it around the house, dropping food/treats all the way. I'd much prefer she keep it in the kitchen so this is a con for me. I also find that the stuff inside falls out way too easily to keep the dog entertained. A minute or so and she has all of the contents on the floor ready to go.On the plus side, this ball is soft sided so it doesn't make much noise on floors like tile or wood, which is very nice. It also works pretty well as a fetch trainer since the dimples make it easy for the dog to grab it and carry it.All-in-all it's a nice product but didn't work for us. I'd recommend it for smaller pets perhaps, but anything of medium or larger size will just pick it up and dump it, not roll it.",dogs,3
"I ordered this, thinking it would be small enough for my little guinea pig to get in and out of, because that is what the picture above states. I thought THAT is what I would be getting, but no. I got a dark blue bed, that a cat could fit into. My guinea pig can barely crawl into it, because the side is too high for him. I ordered a small pet bed, not a cat bed. The product is fine, but I wasn't expecting what I received by any means. If you want a surprise in the mail, order this product. You never know what you are going to get.",bunny rabbit central,1

"We also have some moist minatures (which are bigger), but I have found that these Cheese/Egg dog treats are great training treats. They are soft, tasty, crunchy, and low calorie. The product states that each treat is about 3 calories. Some sessions require more treats, and I definitely do not want my Labrador puppy to fatten up too much. With these treats, it's okay to feed your dog more, if need be.The amount is also generous and plentiful. For about 16 ounces (1 pound), the treats are of good value.Have your dog try these treats! They'll love them.",dogs,3
"hmm where do i start with this one. BE CAREFUL. This is not a life jacket, like for people. I have chihuahua's and they arent the best of swimmers. i had one of my dogs get turned upside down for a second in one and he freaked of course and paniced. we had to grab him. it needs more boyancy on the chest to keep thier head up. the dog does not realize he will stay afloat. so they swim thier little hearts out and can exhauset themselves and can go under with this vest. just enough to drown. i bought the same version locally. little dogs arent meant for water-they do not have the boyancy like a big dog and cant take tides-surf-currents-rapids-swells- etc.....So dont think this will keep your dog up long time- it will for long enough to grab them (thank god) and buys you the time to turn around in boat or backup. i had one jump off poontoon boat without one and i ran grabbed her skin to save her while the boat was running (split second timing) so thats why i bought one.i am an avid boater/dive instructor and breed chihuahua's. now if they only made a dive outfit -lol",dogs,3

"I love how this product has wheels so i can easily move it to sweep and mop. Also, my dog always knocks over the food when we leave her alone, but when she does it to this, it stays closed so I don't have a huge mess to clean up when I get home! :-) Thanks for out smarting my pup!",dogs,3
"My cats, even the one who doesn't care much for fish flavored dry and wet foods, love these flakes. I am happy because they are all natural, and easy for them to eat. Cats tend not to chew their food much and that is why crunchy treats are often a waste of money if not simply bad for digestion.My cats smell this stuff and heads start turning. One of the cats gets flakes on her fur and then happily licks herself to get the remaining bits all cleaned up. They purr like crazy with it.If you are looking for wholesome foods for your cat, make sure you get Ann Martin's book, _Food Pets Die For_, here on Amazon.Have fun!",cats,2
"We have been using Program for our dogs for years and it works beautifully. Here in the San Diego area we tend to just use it during the highest flea season, which is usually May - October, but you can use it year round. Program is a chewable tablet that you give your animal once a month and it keeps him/her flea free. It is so much easier to use than the stuff you have to rub behind their neck and you don't have to worry about it washing off.",cats,2
Bought this for my 5 gallon aquarium tanks and just bought another for my 39 gallon tank and works awesome!

"My dog will do anything for these Salmon Treats. I love that they are made in the USA!! I would not hesitate to try these treats as I am certain your dog will love them as much as mine does. The fact that they are all natural is a huge plus in my book. I also give my dog the duck treats from Plato and he loves them as well. The duck ones are great if your dog suffers from food or skin allergies, the duck treats will not induce itching! I will purchase another variety of these treats the next time I place an order. I am sure he will love anything Plato makes!!!",dogs,3
"I really like the design and sturdiness of this gate. I'm not really good at installing things so got a friend to do it.The only real problem with it is the cat door is too big.
