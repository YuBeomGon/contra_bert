"I have two 18 pound cats and a 13 pound dog/puppy. One of the cats loves drinking out of the faucet, so much that he's sitting at the door waiting for us to wake up in the morning so we can turn the faucet on in the bathroom!After setting up the product (piece of cake, just make sure you put the filter in the right way, which the instructions show you!), I filled it up to the brim with water and turned it on. The humming noise is about as loud as a typical Homedics fountain pump product -- almost relaxing, and not as loud as most people seem to think.The cats got used to the fountain rather quickly, but the puppy took a few days to appreciate it. Now both cats and the puppy are drinking from the fountain and not the bowl! The trickling sound of the fountain is louder than the pump noise, if that calms anyone's fears about how ""loud"" this fountain is.I found that by turning the little switch on the right down by the bowl base, the water level can reach a lower level before it starts making noise. I generally add about 8 ounces of water a day, because all 3 pets drink quite a bit. I'm going to buy the extra canister to hold twice as much water. I was gone camping for three days, and it was still running fine when I got back home.In terms of cleaning, I've had this product for nearly a month and am thinking about cleaning it now. As with any running water product, there's a film forming at the water level of the bowl. Once a month maintenance on this product, versus cleaning it every other day like I used to with a typical bowl, is fine with me!Great product, and not a bad price, either.",cats,2
My cat wouldn't touch this stuff. I wound up giving it to the ASPCA.,cats,2

"We tried three other kinds of dog door before we got our first staywell. We've now bought three of them (none of them have broken, we just have several dogs and foster from our animal shelter so we needed various sizes). They keep out drafts and rain much better than the other styles we tried (2 flexible flap doors and one rigid flap) because of the way the panels overlap. They are designed to be installed in a door, and the installation is very simple. Two of our doors are actually installed in our walls instead (a little harder, depending on your siding type, but still doable). The only downside is that the door makes a fairly loud clacking sound when a dog runs through and that makes it take a little longer to train timid dogs. I would strongly recommend these doors to anyone.",cats,2

Very quick delivery. I got this for my dogs about 6 yrs ago at a pet store as a last resort for a durable toy that would be enjoyable for them for more than a week. It is their favorite toy! They are in their third one in 6 years and that I can live with. I have tried other toys and nothing else compares. I can't find it in any stores. Great product!,dogs,3

"Little absolutely loves this toy! It's such a simple design, I'm embarrassed to have not made it myself. It is well crafted, and can tolerate a hearty tug of war battle, while also being super light and fluid, turning my kitty into a little ballerina. We have fun :)",cats,2
"I opened the package in the living room and it has never made it out to the deck, where it is intended to be used. All 3 of my Shepherds love it and it looks like I need to get at least one more. I got it for my older dog, so he could lay outside comfortably. Now all of them use it.",dogs,3
"My dog has long hair and a lot of it. I tried the furminator and found that it does remove a lot of hair, but one has to be very careful when using it - just like the instructions mention. Because our dog has a lot of hair, it takes regular slow, controlled brushing ~ once per week to keep it under control. The brush is better used on the coat rather than the tail. I use a comb on his tail and hold on to the root section so that it doesn't cause pain. If only the furminator inventors could stop the static build up when brushing. That seems to really bother our dog.",cats,2
"I've got 2 year pitbull power chewer and he hasn't destroyed this in the least. Only thing he's bee able to do is make puncture holes in it and some scratches after 2 months. The reason I gave it four stars is that it smells bad and I can see some dogs not liking that, although my dog didn't mind it but I would recommend the kong stuff n because when I use that he plays with it longer.",dogs,3
I highly recommend to try these cute pet hangers. I used them to hang my Yorkie's clothes and they are great!! They are very durable and made well!! You can also use the hangers for Dog's clothes as well as Cat's clothes.,cats,2
"Up until recently, I had been using his food exclusively, but after several disturbing incidents I have switched brands. In the last few months have found cardboard, hair, and a bug in three separate varieties of Merrick dog and cat food. When I found the cardboard, I contacted the company with my findings and they apologized and mailed me a coupon. Since then, I have found hair in two varieties of dog food and the final straw last week was opening a can of cat food to find a dead fly right on the top of the food. There is no way that this food is being produced in a human facility. The quality is appalling -- especially at these prices. I have spent thousands on Merrick pet foods, but they have lost my business forever.",cats,2
"My dogs are very tough on toys, and they did not tear this one up immediately, which is great. It throws like a frisbee in the house but is soft so there is no damage.",dogs,3
"At first I was dissatisfied that the colors weren't as bright as they appeared in the ad, but then I put it in my aquarium with plants and other decor and it looks great! It looks like a mini coral reef and the colors blend well with the plants on a light white gravel. My fish also use the cave to hide or explore and that is always fun to watch. The quality seems good also. So all-in-all I am very happy with it and the price was very good for the quality.",fish aquatic pets,4

"After the second Litter Maid broke in a couple of years, I bought Litter Robot. My cat used to pee up against the Litter Maid rake, which made a mess every time. No problems with the Litter Robot. And it does look like the Death Star. It isn't silent, but is rarely noticeable. The original one had a defective board, which was replaced by customer service in mere days.There is no smell. Trash bags work fine. Hardest part was leaving the broken Litter Maid to fill up so the choice was between the nasty Litter Maid and the clean Litter Robot. It took 3 days to convince the cat.Just don't tell anybody in the office you spent $300 on a litter box. You may never hear the end of it. Worth it though!Jan 2010 update - still working fine.",cats,2

"The pump sounded like a good deal--SOUNDED is the word that needs to be taken into account here. I bought the pump for a reef aquarium. Before I installed the pump all I could here was the trickle of water from the other pumps. Turned this one on, and I thought I was in the middle of the freeway. LOUD!!! Other reviewers had said it was loud--I should have listened. I will be returning it this week. HyperFlow--It should be named HyperSound",fish aquatic pets,4

"I agree that this isn't terribly tricky and that cats can get the treats out relatively quickly, but they still love it and get very excited when they see me filling up their ""treat balls."" Because of the ease of getting the food out I usually fill these up with their regular kibble and let them use it to get some or all of their morning meal-definitely more fun and more active than the usual hovering over the bowl.Instead of giving each of my cats their own treat ball, I've started to put one treat ball out at a time-it makes it more challenging and fun for them to have to chase and battle for access to the treat ball (assuming your cats get along as well as ours do.) They make it like a game of soccer, and its very funny to see them trying to steal the ball from each other and to block the ball from being stolen while they chomp down the food that they have earned. One of my cats even has figured out how to ""guard"" the ball by sitting on it while he is busy eating the treat that fell out. Another has perfected the ""swat"".",cats,2
"I love this collar - it's a huge help in training my rambunctious Boxer puppy. The quality of this thing is clearly evident. It's made of top-notch materials and designed really well. I will say that people are horrified by how this thing looks. Especially on a cute puppy - it really resembles some instrument of torture. But she isn't scared of it and even really bothered by a correction. She doesn't whimper or cry, she just doesn't pull. It takes a bit to get used to putting it on, but it's a great tool if used responsibly.",dogs,3
"great product, I have two stray dogs I take care of and this enables me to get meds into them without handling.",cats,2
This is a wonderful comb for getting knots out of show coats. It works well either in wet or dry hair and is very hand friendly and makes it a little easier on the dog that is being combed out. I use this product with almost every one of my show dogs and it works very well for me and hold up well for the work I have to do on my show dogs.,dogs,3
"I bought a few of these to try them out and was not too impressed. They don't have much meat on them and my dogs doesn't go crazy for them.For this price you're much better off buying cow gullet or lamb trotter bones, which have a lot more meat and dogs love.",dogs,3
"My chihuahua pup loves these. I've tried them out on labradors and greyhounds as well - gone in a flash (so buy in bulk or use as occasional treats only.)I prefer to buy Merrick's treats over the typical brands in the pet supermarts - those are often imported from Brazil, and I don't trust those manufacturers.One of these lasts for my 6 lb. chihuahua pup for 2 weeks or so. One of the great things about these, is that if you offer enough inviting, organic dried animal treats like these - your pup may choose mostly to chew approved-only materials.The one possible downside to offering a puppy dried animal parts like this, is that my chi never would chew on a Kong after getting use to this sort of treat. He has no interest in any nylon or plastic chew, which is a bummer, because they last much longer. Oh well.",dogs,3
"We searched everywhere for something to keep our chew happy 1 year old German Shorthair occupied. The Kong only held up for a few weeks and never held enough treats to keep him entertained for more than 5 minutes. The Buster Block only slid on our hardwood floors. I actually purchased the Omega Paw ball with the Buster Block to get free Super Saver Shipping. Big mistake, I should have purchase another Omega Paw ball! We put dog food and/or Cheerios in it. Our Pointer plays with it inside and out for 30-45 minutes at a time. It took about 10 minutes to teach him to roll it with his paw or nose. This was easy to do by nudging it with my foot a few times. Once he realized the nudging meant goodies he was all about it. When it's empty or mostly empty, he usually picks it up and brings it to us or moves on to running circles around the house. It is the best $12 we have spent! So far, 6 months with minimal wear. We still keep bones around for chewing too.",dogs,3
"Initially, I rated this product at two-stars because the product details didn't state that the Perma-Lid attachment was NOT included. It shows it in the pictures, but when it arrived the enclosed paperwork states that you have to purchase a ""combo pack"" to get the lid attachment. It would have been nice if this information was clearly stated. Upon posting this review, the Litter Works Customer Service followed up with clarification and correction of the problem by sending me the permanent lid attachment. These actions were greatly appreciated. I am looking forward to trying the system out now that the Perma-Lid arrived and I can put the whole system into use. If all works out well and my cats take to the changes in their litter box set-up, this four-star review could be upgraded with a fifth star.Regardless of how the system works out, I am very impressed with the company's customer service follow-up. 5-stars to Litter Works Customer Service. Thanks to Brian.",cats,2
"My first dog loved this toy as soon as I took it out of the box. He isn't an aggressive chewer, so I don't have to worry about the toy being ripped apart. He likes to throw it around and chew on it.** UPDATE ** After 6 months, the paws and ears have been chewed off, but overall still a useable toy.

I got this product to help my dog with his separation anxiety. I put peanut butter inside of it and give it to him as I'm leaving the house. He licks the peanut butter out and then doesn't play with the ball after that. I don't usually let him continue playing with this treat dispensing toys after the treat is gone....so I'm happy that he stops playing with it once the peanut butter is gone. It seems like a durable toy even for dogs that would continue to play after getting the treat.,dogs,3

"Very easy to use and setup was quick. I originally had the Petsafe wired version and had trouble with the buried lines after just a few years of use. I like the idea of being able to take this one on trips and still keep my dog contained. My only complaint is the range is not as large as I had hoped. I have to keep the unit on the back wall of my house. Even then, the range does not extend the distance of my moderately sized yard.",dogs,3
"Besides the Kong, that is! If you have a dog that loves to play fetch, buy this! Everytime it comes out of the closet my dog goes nuts and she can't stop fetching until I make her and put it up high and away! Cannot beat the exercise you give your dog with this, either.",dogs,3

"We discovered that our eight year old Lab, a rescue dog, loves squeaky toys and doesn't destroy them. He likes the AKC Duck best but this CANADA (not Canadian, please!) Goose is also a winner. For some reason the rabbit, which has been panned by other reviewers, did not squeak after the first day. Instead it feels like there is a plastic bag in its belly that crinkles.If your dog likes to tear toys apart, these are too easily destroyed. Try the Kyjen Hard Boiled Softies Dog Toys instead. The Hedgehog we have is loud and tough. The rubber shell makes it fun to throw as it is heavy and bouncy.",dogs,3

Also, the best thing is, my Chihuahua and 2 Dachshunds can play with. I would say that it would work with everyone from German Shepard to Chihuahua!!",dogs,3
"My dogs love this. One does the work and they both snack. One dog is not interested in the play, at all. I don't know if she would roll it around if the other dog wasn't. They both grab the treats that come out and keep both of them occupied. It would have gotten 5 stars, but it is a little tedious to fill.",dogs,3
"I already owned a crate this size from a different manufacturer and paid around $20. When I received the two new crates I ordered, I noticed the gauge of the metal was of an inferior quality to the one I already owned. Also, one of the doors would not open and close properly due to the whole front face of the crate being lopsided. Very disappointing to spend a few dollars more and get so much less.",dogs,3
"My two dogs absolutely love this toy. It's big, durable, and priced incredibly low compared to other dog toys. An all-around good value! I have two Labradoodles, one 100 lbs. and the other 40 lbs. This toy is big enough for them to play tug-o-war and durable enough that they haven't ripped it to shreds yet. I have demonstrated for them how the eggs come out. I simply pull one of the eggs out, squeak it, and put it back in the slit. They LOVE working to get the eggs out. One of my dogs is obsessed with balls and tosses around the eggs like a ball once he gets it out. I highly recommend this toy and am very pleased with the purchase.",dogs,3
"I paid an outrageous price ($1.49) for this product at a pet store. It is made far too rigidly to work on the smallest size cans. Once it is on the can, it is impossible for me to remove.

If you use the smallest size cans, forget about this one!",cats,2

"We have tried this collar and the Tri tronics bark collar for small dogs, and the Petsafe collar is smaller and seems to be more comfortable on our 3 small dogs. The other thing we like about the Petsafe collar is that it is self-adjusting, so if your dog barks once and the first mild shock doesn't correct the barking, it automatically increases the intensity of the shock. The intensity of the Tri tronics collar needs to be manually adjusted by you. Both are good products, but the Petsafe collar works better for us and our mini dachshunds & Papillion.",dogs,3
"I really didn't want to use any kind of chemical product on my dog, but after waging a losing battle trying to go all natural, I finally gave up and just used Frontline. I bought my Frontline Plus at the local Agway Feed and Seed store. 48 hours later, my dog is STILL itchy and miserable - and still covered with as many if not more fleas than before!When I called Frontline, I was told that the only REAL Frontline must be purchased through veterinarians and if it was NOT purchased through a vet, it is FAKE! I'm livid that I bought mine from a store that is a large chain and it's probably fake.I would caution anyone buying online - you may be getting a counterfeit product.

"I made the mistake of purchasing two of these carriers (one large size, one smaller size) for my cats. I would never recommend them! I transported my larger cat (she weighs 16 lbs) to the vet in the large size carrier. While there was plenty of room for her, it was not stable enough to transport her safely. She had torn two holes in the mesh side by the time I got there. The vet's office is less than 3 miles from my home. The second problem was that the bottom of this carrier did not provide enough support for my cat. As I carried her, the bottom of the carrier bulged underneath. I ended up not even using the handles--I held the carrier using both arms so I could support the bottom with one arm. The third, and very dangerous, situation was",dogs,3

I contacted the manufacturer and was told to contact Amazon. I noted that the instructions said to contact manufacturer.""Those are old instructions. Contact Amazon."" I did contact Amazon and received a whole new cat box cabinet in (2) days. I pulled out the new door and replaced it with the defective door. Everything worked out fine. A little inconvenient in returning the replacement cabinet. Had to tote it 30 miles to UPS station. Item too big for drop boxes. It was 30 #'s and a bit awkward to carry. I had noticed in a review I read that a customer had the same problem. I also took note of other reviews and lined the bottom of the cabinet with contact paper as I was assembling the cabinet. I also purchased a high sided litter pan to go inside. The cabinet is working out great and I get a lot of compliments on it.",cats,2
"We bought one of these almost three years ago and it has helped us tremendously. I confronted our neighbor about three years ago about his dogs barking, he told me if I had a problem with his dog barking to call the police, I did! He tried to have a restraining order put on us so we couldn't call the police, the judge quickly threw it out and told him to keep his dogs quiet, which he never did. So when he saw me putting this thing up he went balistic. The dogs kennel is about 7ft from my garage where I hung it. The barking is down to less than a quarter of what it used to be. I have had my best results putting it on the setting so the neighbors hear it also,apparently they don't like to hear it ! Too Bad, so sad! The dog gets used to it so every once in a while I unplug it for a day or so. When it is unplugged you definitely hear an increase in barking. Plug it back in and you definitely hear the difference. It has really helped us where the neighbor wouldn't do anything and the cops always showed up after it stopped barking !",dogs,3

I recently used my new Argo pet carrier to transport my cat across the country on JetBlue. The medium carrier fit perfectly under the seat in front of me and the desk agent didn't give it a second glance after saying hello to the kitty inside. The double mesh windows seemed very secure and their relatively small size insured that the cat couldn't have escaped even if she had been inclined to rip them. The smaller windows also meant that she was calmer because she couldn't really see how many people were around. I was a bit nervous about ventilation at first but I kept checking on her and she didn't seem to be getting too hot. She was definitely the coolest kitty at Logan International. I highly recommend this bag.,dogs,3

I put them on my dogs, who were extremely anxious (shaking) from the last experience, and waited. I tried to calm them down by feeding treats. One of the collars went off while the dog took a treat. Needless to say, my dog was extremely confused and refused to take any treats for 24 hours after that. I took both collars off. Very frustrating especially since they worked SO WELL in stopping the barking.",dogs,3

I do have to say that ""kitty"" has figure out that he can get some ""snacks"" from the feeder by putting his paw into the dispensing hole and ""fishing"" a bit. That goes to show cats are smart. They don't get much food that way, so it's not really a problem. Knowing that my cats won't go hungry (or overeat and stuff themselves) when I am there is well worth it, as far as I am concerned.",cats,2
"I purchased this leash due to the reflective strip for dusk walks. I use it with a gentle leader so there is limited pulling on the clip. In the month I have owned it the clip has unhooked 3 times.

"This product is not really a dog bed or what my dogs would call ""cozy"" It would be best used as a crate pad for short-term crating or as a bed only for dogs under 30lbs. Heavier dogs need more depth to their bed. For dogs over 30lbs if this bed were used on top of carpeting that has carpet padding below, that would be adequate for most dogs up to 90lbs, but still isn't ideal. Used on a wood/tile floor this bed does now allow your pet's hip/shoulder joints to sink in.I have purchases dozend of pet beds for my rescue over the years. I can't for the life of me, figure out why this one is so pricy. One night we had both dogs in the same room and only one bed available. We took out an old comforter and folded it 4 ways. Our 60lb and 70lb dogs competed for the folded comforter and ignored the ""cozy comforter"" unless it was the only option (and that was on a carpeted floor). The best beds for large dogs will have at least a thin layer of firm foam and/or a thick layer of soft foam. A layer of Poly-fill above the foam allows for them to snuggle in and nest while that layer of foam keeps bones from pushing through to a too-firm surface (your floor). Poly-fill alone tends to shift leaving spots that don't provide enough cushion. I haven't yet found a bed that is perfect for large dogs but is under $75, so I just make my own. You can do this too. Just buy a low-cost or high-end a poly-fill dog bed that has the poly-fill in a liner. Remove a little of the stuffing (save for later if the bed goes flat over time). Cut to size and insert 1-3 layers (1 layer for dogs up to 50lbs, 2 layers for dogs up to 100, 3 layers for giant dogs) of Target 2"" mattress-pad foam into the outer liner and then insert the liner with poly-fill. The pad here is 4"" so it is adequate for large dogs but over-kill for those under 50lbs.EggCrate Foam Mattress Pad - Thickness 4 inches",dogs,3

"I am a city dweller with two small dogs. The chemicals that most multi-family apartment and condo buildings use on the sidewalks to melt the snow and ice causes my dogs a lot of pain when they walk through it. I used Pawz dog boots pretty successfully these past couple of winters but worried about what my dog sitter would do. I knew she would never be able to get boots on my boys so I ordered Musher's Secret. I have used Musher's Secret for several weeks now, through the worst snow and ice stoms in years - and very heavey salt and chemical applications on the sidewalks. My dogs haven't had any problem walking through the salt and chemicals at all. This is a wonderful product and is a great time saver since it goes on faster than their boots! I don't notice much residue on my wood floors - just a bit that wipes off with soft cloth. I never thought my boys could go bare foot in the winter time in the city!

"These granules work fine in our CatGenie - we've had it for almost two months and have had no problems with clogging or sticking or anything. We have it set to run a automatically a few times a day and are very happy not to be scooping litter anymore! Many people have commented about the granules ending up around the house and they do get kicked or tracked out of the CatGenie pretty easily. We have ours in our bathroom, though, and have found that keeping a dustpan nearby and sweeping them up every few days works well. As long as you're not picking up a lot of floor grunge with them, you can just dump them right back into the CatGenie and they'll get washed clean on the next cycle. This cuts down on the amount of granule purchasing we have to do. Also, be sure not to overfill the CatGenie - overfilling can cause clogs. The fill line was lower than I expected, but the litter stays so clean that the cats don't seem to mind.",cats,2

"My cat loves to drink from the bathtub faucet. She'll follow you into the bathroom and sit with her head at the faucet until you let it drip for her. She recently had back surgery and was confined to a room so she couldn't get to the tub and my wife was worried should wouldn't drink enough out of a bowl, so she ordered one of these. My wife was also worried about wasting water when we let it drip out of the faucet and forget to turn it off.My cat took to the fountain ok and now that she is roaming free again, she seems to prefer it to drinking from a bowl. She still can't jump so she still can't get to the tub faucet. But the problem with this fountain, at least for us, is that after 4 or 5 days, it gets really slimy and it is quite a pain to pull apart and clean all the nooks and crannies to get the sliminess to go away. Between having to dump all the water in it (and it is quite a bit) to clean it, and the water that runs while I clean and rinse it, I'm pretty sure we are actually using much more water with this fountain than we did when we let the bathtub faucet slowly drip for her. I'm also concerned about her drinking the slimy water before I get a chance to clean it.I can't really compare it to other fountains or say how well it will last over the long-term, but my impressions with it for the past 6 weeks are that we will probably go back to dripping water from the bathtub once she can jump into the tub again. The sliminess is a pain and rather unsettling.",cats,2

"I have two cats that turned up on my doorstep the same cold winter night. One is a true farm tom cat and the other I believe might have been a pet to someone in her first few months. Anyway, knowing these cats have never used a little box I was really concerned bringing them indoors. I prefer to use all natural products so I thought I should try to find the same for them. This litter is great. It does control the odor extremely well and while the bad review comments are not 100% false what I have found to work is a thin layer of pine pellets, a layer of pine clumping litter then a load of the cedarific on top. The pine pellets are a great absorbent, the clumping pine takes care of the cedarific soft crumbles. The cedarific does track easier than other litter but I put a wee wee pad in front of the box with a litter mat on top which does help, but the fact that they both use the litter box without a problem is well worth a tiny wood chip here or there. Nothing a dust pan can't fix quick. You would never ever know I have cats if you didn't see them. It isn't inexpensive to do it this way but I only have to change out once a week with two cats. if they didn't like the litter it would cost more to replace whatever they used instead of the box- I am a huge fan of this litter.",cats,2

Over the last 15 years I have tried every brand of carbon out there. From Marinlan to the generic brands even some of the store brands that you buy from Petco or Petsmart.Does this work? Oh yeah quite well in fact. BUT so does the cheap stuff. I have bought 3lb bags of generic carbon from a seller here on Amazon and that stuff works just as well.The difference? On this product they break it all into tiny little bits compared to the cheap stuff is usually in pellet form.personally I have considered even grinding or blending (in a blender) the cheap stuff to see if you can achieve the same consistency as the more prepared stuff from this company or Marineland. Not that I can or can not prove ot really makes any difference.Personally I am going back to the cheap stuff. I clean my filter every two months and replace the carbon then and like I said can't see any difference. At least not one worth paying 5x as much for .,fish aquatic pets,4
"My twelve year old short hair tortie was dying. I'd taken her to the the top vets in the city. Nobody could figure out what was wrong. She was losing all her hair on her belly, from neck to feet. She was losing weight. She stopped eating. They found nothing wrong with her digestive system except that her intestines were ""ropey"", whatever that means. Her bloodwork was all normal. I tried allergy diets. I tried allergy shots. Nothing. On a hunch, I changed her litter to Nature's Miracle (had been using one of the top clay clumping formulas for twelve years). Well, it didn't take long. After a month, she began to recover. She is now back to normal weight, fur has regrown after two years of baldness, she's happy and frisky and eating everything (no allergies).

"After reading the reviews and losing all of my security deposit (and then some) from my last apartment due to my cat's constant scratching of the woodwork, I decided to try this item. I really had my doubts about my luck with it as my cat can be very fussy about being directed to do anything like where to scratch. At 1st, as some dissatisfied users reported, my cat showed absolutely no interest in the post. When he would scratch the woodwork, I would place him at the post and he not only showed no interest in the post, but even retracted his claws as a further insult.I thought ""another waste of money."" Then I remembered that one of the posts I read in the reviews was from a lady who had the same disinterested reaction from her cat and who enticed her cat to scratch the post by teasing the cat with his favorite swinging cat toy on top of and around the post. Feeling I had nothing to lose, I gave it a try and I simply couldn't believe it. The cat dug his claws deep into the post while swatting at the cat toy and the rest is history. He became so interested in the scratching post that he forgot the toy. Afterwards, he tried to scratch the walls only a few times and just saying ""no' sent him to the nearby cat toy. Another good recommendation I read was to place the scratching post near where most of his scratching behavior usually takes place.I also want to comment on how sturdy this item is. It only took about a minute or so to assemble and is solidly constructed and not likely to tip over. I have a huge Ragdoll cat over 20 pounds of muscle and he hasn't knocked it over yet and he vigorously uses the post now. Sorry for this being so lengthy, but I hope it can help someone who, like me, was a sceptic and at first thought this isn't going to work.

"This is my second littermaid. We purchased this one because we adopted a kitten and did not think our cat would want to share or if it was being used the kitten may not be able to wait and go outside the litterbox. We have the littermaids side by side in the room. This model littermaid is large enough for our 19.12 lb cat (maine coon)to use and he and the kitten love that it is covered (so do I). We reuse the plastic bins as much as possible by emptying the bin into plastic shopping bags (you could probably line the bin with the plastic bag and just pull it out to empty it replacing with a new one so the bin stays clean). I did have a problem emptying the container out as the tent didn't allow the lid to open all the way for emptying so I took a razor blade and cut across the front part of the tent a little so it would open wider and used Scotch fastener strips(like double side tape that fastens) to hold the sides back. The littermaid has no problem scooping up the clumps and putting them into the container. I have a large storage bin that I put a 50/50 mix of Worlds Best Cat Litter multi-cat (even when I only had one cat)and Natures Miracle Cat litter (it is pine scented)and mix together. I found that this combo works great for clumping,minimizing any possible smell and the littermaid works great and smoothly with it. I have also tried the elite mega littermaid but find the air ionizer/filter takes up too much inner litterbox area. I read some comments about noise when it scoops the litter but it is not anywhere as noisy as when your ice tray in the freezer drops ice and don't we all still have our automatic icemakers hooked up? The littermaid is only on for maybe 15-30 seconds to scoop so it is not bothersome at all & ours is on 24/7. There is a little litter that accumulates outside the box but inside the tent but that may be my cat being over zealous with burial, at least the litter is contained inside the tent and not all over the floor.

"I bought 2 of these crates for a 60 lb border collie mix, and a 50 lb pitbull/lab mix. They are extremely easy to set up, and roomy enough for both dogs to stretch out. The crates are properly assembled according to the instructions, but both dogs have figured out how to break out without opening the front door, which I'm guessing is why they're so much cheaper than similar crates.The border collie will put all her weight on the top rear corner, and because of the collapsible design and the hinged walls, the stress pops a couple latches loose, detaching one corner of the back panel from the rest of the frame. She has this down to a science, and will break out within minutes of me leaving the room. It looks like the other dog just pushed on the front panel until it warped and popped right off (the metal is very bendable). It's warped to the point where the latches don't even line up now.I was really pleased with the crates for the first week or so, and the dogs love them while I'm here, but I wouldn't recommend this particular crate for clever and/or stronger dogs with separation anxiety.",dogs,3

I really like this tank. I first used it for a few fat little goldfish and later for a betta and some corys. As long as you do not over feed or over load with fish the filtration works well and keeps water very clean although I wish it had undergravel filtration instead. Filtration is quiet and there are spaces in the top for heaters or accessories. One thing to be careful of is scratching the acrylic. I had a problem with algae growth and used one of those magnetic scrapers that didn't feel that abrasive to me but it scratched the acrylic pretty bad. I would recommend this tank to anyone wanting only a handful of fish.,fish aquatic pets,4
"We recently adopted our 10 year old beagle from the local shelter and were shocked at the shedding. We tried everything with lukewarm results - until the clerk at Petco whispered that she used the furinator and it has to be ordered online.

So if you have a dog hair problem I recommend this product ... the back seat of my car and the bed where Flash secretly sleeps all day are now dog hair free!",cats,2
"My boy kitty named Bunny drools when two things come out, and neither of these is me or food. Da Bird makes him ecstatic like no other toy he has. Bunny can be anywhere in the house - even when he's sleeping - and he runs to me ... salivating ... the moment I even touch Da Bird. In fact, Bunny loves this toy so much that he almost destroyed it within a few hours by tearing the feathers from the base ... but I saved it and this is how. I took the feathers he tore off and put them back in the small black plastic piece (looks like 1/2 of a pill capsule if you take it apart). Then I tied them around several times with the (very thin) plastic 'wire' I use for hanging pictures. Then I wrapped some narrow black electrical tape over that. I also used this tape to wrap the toy in other areas that previous reviewers noted as (possibly or actually) 'dangerous.' After about four months I purchased two of the Da Bird refills to replace the original feathers that Bunny ripped to bits over time. He still goes crazy over Da Bird, and when I am not playing with it, he drags it around my house and plays all by himself. TOh yeah, the other 'toy' that Bunny drools for is Zoom Groom, which takes off more fur than any other brush I have used, and is also a chew toy for my fantastic kitty.Kong Zoom Groom For Cats",cats,2

"I bought the Kyjen squirrels in a log toy for my dog, and he absolutely loves taking the squirrels and any other toy I put in there out. I thought he would like these ""egg babies"" also, but he doesn't really take the balls out of this one. It is an okay toy, and I'm sure lots of dogs love it, but mine isn't too into it. He does play with the squeaky balls by themselves and I hide them in his other toys so it isn't wasted money. He knows how to remove the eggs, he just doesn't really do it. He prefers having a bigger opening, I guess. (He also has the bees in the hive toy and loves that one, too)",dogs,3
"One of our dogs is a Siberian Husky mix. He came as a stray to our house and looked horrible. Aside from being skinny, his coat was all tangled up.

"I have a little Chihuahua that jumps off the bed at night. The bed is too high from the ground and she can not jump back up. She is a little princess and will whine and cry until someone wakes up and brings her back in the bed. These stairs were the solution to our problem!!It took some training, but we got her to use them. The stairs are great for medium to small sized dogs. They are plastic and kinda sturdy, but I would not recommend them for any dog over 40lbs. I am afraid the stairs will topple over if a larger sized dogs runs too quickly up them",dogs,3
"This seems like a quality product if your dog is not a strong chewer. My 80 pound puppy loved it....carried it around, slept with it.

"I bought similar bowls at Petco, and am now going to return them. While the Petco ones have rubber all across the bottom (this one is a 3/4 inch ring around the edge), the Petco ones are slightly lighter weight, and more expensive.These are a good weight, and don't have that annoying fingernail-on-chalkboard sound that some lighter weight metal bowls make. The rubber ring is rubbery, not plastic-y, so it does actually grip the floor.I am using this size (1.2 Pint) for food for my puppy. It may end up being too small/ having too much slop-over when she is full grown, but for now it's a good size for her, and probably will be for at least the next 6 months.I think the ""it stinks"" reviewer got a bad bowl; mine have absolutely no odor...",dogs,3

He was pulling off large shreds within 2 minutes, had it broken in half within 10 minutes and chewed one half down to the knot in less than an hour. While I don't think this is a bad quality bone, the rawhide is not as thick as other bones I have purchased, which I am assuming is why he was able to tear it apart so fast.",dogs,3

The first time she managed to make the front part unlatch and fall in so to fix that I ziptied it all along the sides and top. Today I came home to find that she literally broke the main latch off the door, it snapped at the welds. So now I'm in the process of adhering that back on but overall I'm severely disappointed with this cage. She's been able to bend several of the bars in different locations so it's obviously not made out of the best materials but for the price I expected better.",dogs,3

"I have always wondered that if you are a manufacturer and spend all those investment money to manufacture a product, why you don't just spent a little extra time to test your product!! This feeder is one of those products that just do not deliver what they suppose to, because it's clearly not tested in real life condition. First of all the feeder is easy to flip over. I took some time to screw it into a wooden board to make it more stable. But the second problem is even worse. It doesn't take long for a cat (cats are naturally designed to stick their paws into all kinds of holes) to figure out how to get into the the dispenser opening and jiggle it long enough to get the food to come out. I have tried many ways to glue things and devise some king of protection but all failed in the end. Then the timer got out of control and time just kept changing. Resetting it didn't help. I got a new timer from a hardware store but the feeder's motor stopped working soon after. What can I say. Don't spent money on this junk.",cats,2
This dog food is terrific. My dogs love it and it is very filling. They don't eat it all up really fast like with the cheaper brands. I have a greyhound and they have skin problems when they eat the wrong kinds of food. Not the case with this food. The only thing that I am disappointed about is that I have ordered through amazon and I chose 2 day shipping and it has been 5 days and they still havent shipped the dog food.,dogs,3

"This product is a BIG improvement over the Litter Maid self-cleaning litter box that we've had for the past four years. It is MUCH more quiet which we appreciate because we have the litter box in our bedroom and the other one would sometimes wake us up at night when it did a cleaning cycle. I'm also happy that I don't have to empty the waste receptacle on a weekly basis as I did with the Litter Maid box. However, I have noticed that we can't quite make it to 30 days without replacing the crystals cartridge. Perhaps it is because we have an older cat (which is what the Scoop Free literature mentions as a reason) but we only seem to go about 10-14 days before we have to replace the cartridge. This is still a big improvement over our old litter box and the fact that it is so quiet during the cleaning cycle makes it all worth it. I definitely recommend this product!",cats,2
"Great collar. Cute design. My (BAD) dog chewed in half in about a day. I leave his collar loose in case his sister gets ahold of it, it won't choke him as quickly. So, he was able to get to it and chewed it in half. This would have (and has) happened with almost any nylon collar, so it is not a reflection on the collar. Good news- I mailed it to Lupine along with my address and I had a new one in about a week! No hassle, no phone calls, no charges, no questions. I tightened it up and I've had no problems.",dogs,3

"While it's not the highest-tech waterer I've seen out there, it works for my cats as there is no ready access to an electrical outlet for the fancy recirculating models. A full reservoir lasts about a week for my two mostly-outdoor cats, and they're happy with it.",cats,2
"Our barker stopped immediately after we put his collar on him, and continued to be quiet and docile for a while even after we removed it.

"I have 2 cats. One is a few years old and then I have the ""new"" baby of the family. She's 7 months old and likes to turn over water bowls or play in the water with her paw. I did a lot of research before buying the Drinkwell Platinum and it paid off because it was a very good purchase for me and my kitties. It's very easy to set up and get going - - - just make sure you DO read the instruction book which is very helpful and shows pictures of the product, step-by-step. I would say it takes around a gallon of water to completely fill up, including the reservoir. I use store-bought drinking/distilled water rather than our city water. It's very quiet and the stream is adjustable. It's also easy to break down and clean - - - which I recommend doing this once a week or so. I do use the cleaning kit that is also sold on Amazon. The brushes are the perfect size. Another cool feature is that it has a connector between the plug-in and the base, so if you have to plug it in at an outlet that is hard to reach, you can just unplug the connector and take the fountain to the sink to clean.My kitten loves it! She loves drinking from the stream of water and my older cat just drinks from the base. Unless you have one of those cats that's scared of everything, your cat should enjoy it too. I think it encourages cats to drink more, which definitely is a benefit to their health. The clear plastic reservoir on the back allows you to actually realize how much your cat is drinking.I would also like to note that I have also tried another type of drinking fountain that was dome-shaped (another brand). It wasn't nearly as easy to set up and use and clean as the Drinkwell.",cats,2

I can tell it doesn't hurt her but she does NOT like it (and cat owners know- if the cat doesn't like it, it ain't happening). At least she doesn't attack it or growl like with her old brush. I end up doing the brushing in spurts of a minute or two at a time, but they are very effective minutes!",cats,2

This fountain provides the convenience of a water bottle plus a functional filtration system that helps keep the water clean.My cats like it just fine although they were certainly curious about the sound it makes!

Overall a great product. The only problems I've encountered so far are:-The hose nozzle is too big and not flexible enough. I think a push button on/off would be better than the dial.-The harness and collar do not adjust down enough - leave too much wiggle room.The best part is not having to be bent over all the time. A back saver!,dogs,3

"I have 3 cats; 2 males and 1 female. I ordered 2 of these litter boxes because it was the only self-cleaning litter box I could find with a plastic hood (the boy cats like to hike their legs way up in the air so a plastic hood was required). My biggest issue with this litter box was the rake. It would miss the waste, smoosh the waste against the sides of the litter box, or smash it against the back of the litter box. Also, waste would get trapped in the rake and it would just get yucky. I had to scrub the litter box and the rake weekly to get it clean and it was very time consuming. Also, the litter trays were very expensive and didn't last nearly as long as they were supposed to. The litter trays didn't even last an entire week because of the smell. The urine would just sit in the crystals and the solid waste that did get raked up underneath the trap filled up quickly and just sat there. Every time the trap would lift up for the rake, you could smell the terrible waste odor throughout the house. One of my cats got fed up with the smell and started using the bathroom on the bathroom rug. So I returned these litter boxes and went back to the old fashioned kind that you clean yourself. On the positive side, these litter boxes were very roomy and attractive. The hood stayed on them very securely and the cardboard litter trays never leaked. But they just didn't work out. Amazon was very nice about me returning them.",cats,2

"Our dog had a similar ball to this one for about 5 years and it was his favorite toy ever and after 5 years of daily chewing never once left a hole or loose plastic pieces. When we went looking for a replacement, we found this item. This item looks almost identical to the one we had for 5 years, but this one is made of soft, easily-removed-by-dog plastic and only lasted about 3 weeks before we had to take it away from him because we were concerned that he would swallow the plastic that was easily coming off as he chewed it. We ordered another one and after only a few weeks, we will be tossing this one as well. Our dog is less than 20 pounds and is 13 years old and had no problem chewing this ball apart very quickly. This is not a safe toy for your dog. This item easily presents a choking hazard for dogs and I would NOT recommend purchasing it.",dogs,3

buut maybe too great of a toothpaste! My dog (mini yorkiepoo) thinks its a treat and tries to lick it off as soon as its on his teeth so I have to brush relatively quickly. Maybe thats the only drawback. He's much more fond of this toothpaste than the last probably because its not so minty. I like how there's a big and a small toothbrush. The small tooth brush makes it a lot easier to brush the back teeth.,dogs,3

"We have 4 dogs and 2 cats. 2 puppies and 2 four yr old dogs. I notice that each dog had different sensitivity levels to it. The puppies responded really well and learned very quickly. The were not afraid of it and obeyed quickly and then looked to use for a command. We used it to train off and not to eat the chickens. We paired the sound with the No command then after the stopped we gave a new command and a treat for obedience.On my mom's 4 yr old American Bulldog we used it to train him not to bark when separated from the family and not to charge the grandkids and guests when they come in the door. He gets excited and wants to love them but he is massive and knocks people down. He is twice as sensitive to it as the other dogs to the point of almost fearful of it even though he is the alpha dog and very confident. It was a surprise to see him so sensitive to it. So he needed much less training with the device. I hope to use it next to teach him not to kill chickens or cats so he can come to our house to play more often.Our 4yr old Chessie is not quite as sesitive to it and we have to press the button twice, so we are still having to use it to teach him not to go in the pond after dark and to drop it. We have only had the chessie about 6 weeks and he did not learn drop it in before.Bc we have so many dogs, we also worked on these training points with the dogs separated so that all the dogs would not be ""disciplined"" because they all had different behaviors. We also positively reward after they have obeyed. We just use it to interrupt they were previously ignoring us on and then reward good behavior.It works very well on our cats!!! They hate it.;-)",dogs,3

"I purchased this for my 8 month old kitten because my dog has a habit of trying to ""go"" in the litterbox and the cat was disgusted by this. I tried everything from Hooded pans to a ""Booda"" box and he always managed to pee in it. About to give up I stumbled on this box and FINALLY something that worked. The cat had no trouble figuring it out and is super happy that his litterbox is all his again. The dog still tries to ""go"" in the box, but it gets on the pee pad next to it instead saving me the hassle of cleaning up his mess daily.",cats,2

"While I can't vouch if this product actually removes odors as it advertises, I can guarantee that it's one of the worst smelling ""odor destroyer"" products out there. I sprayed one mist and my wife and I were gagging. If you have a strong stomach and don't mind the smell of terrible rotten eggs, than this product is great for you. I, on the other hand, could not stand the smell of this product for even a second! There is no way I could spray this on my carpet let alone let it near my nostrils. Of course this spray is going to cover your pets odors! It could cover the stench of a garbage dump with its powerful chemical aroma.",cats,2

"I have had my Litter Robot for 11 months now and LOVE IT! I had a minor problem about a month after I got it but the customer service was great and they promptly sent me a new one that has worked great ever sense. It's easy to clean and contains the smell very well. My cat also loves it, at first she spent time just playing in it. But she was a very small kitten when I got it so I don't know how an older cat would like it. I empty it once a week on garbage day but forgot once for two weeks and it handled it well.a bit expensive but worth every penny.",cats,2
"We prefer the 'guillotine' style of claw clipper for our five cats as it is less likely to shred the claw and does a neater job of removing the tip. We also find it easier to use than the 'scissor' type clipper, but be sure to get some replacement blades, otherwise you will begin to shred your cat's claws.We've been using the Resco brand trimmer ever since our Humane Society friend clued us into the product. It's a very sturdy clipper and the blades are easy to replace--just don't remove the two little screws like I did before reading the directions--press down on the blade ejector tab and the blade pops right out.These are heavy-duty blades, and you can go for quite awhile (up to a year) between replacements.",dogs,3
"These ears look nothing like the picture. They are small and some of that length is made up of the knobby uncut base and not the ear. Again, the picture shows a cut ear without the base. Worse, they smell...badly. Don't think I can store them in the house and can't handle them without getting the smell in your hands. Seems like the smell is coming from the ear base. I've bought nice, clean, white large ears from another supplier and these are nothing like them.",dogs,3

"This product has been excellent for dosing when performing water changes. Subsequent to its use we have found that our corals ""bloom"" as full as possible and appear to be at their healthiest. Even thought we produce R/O water using a high end filter with four cartridges including resin and deionization, adding this product to the R/O water when performing water changes seems to improve water quality.Also, when I look at my tank and see my corals are not looking as healthy as I would like, adding this product at the recommended doses produces immediate results and within ten minutes we see a substantial improvement in the look of our corals.",fish aquatic pets,4
"We have an adult male fancy rat and even the small size harness was useless. Rats and mice have an amazing ability to wiggle through the thinnest openings, and it is impossible to get either end of this harness small enough to fit. Our rat was able to wiggle forward or backward with ease to escape. And keep in mind that the box insert warns you to keep a finger space between your pet and the harness. Heck, the rat's neck alone is a finger width. The whole time I was struggling to get him in the harness, I was constantly worried I would hurt his neck or legs. It's really stressful on the little guys (not to mention the owner), and is not worth the reward of having him on a leash, so I'm returning the harness tomorrow.While this may very well work with larger animals, I have to give a 1 star review because the picture on the box promises a rat in the harness. What you don't realize is that they used an ultra-high-speed camera to capture that shot, as the rat was out of the harness a fraction of a second later.",bunny rabbit central,1

"I have a 115 lb., 11 year old yellow Labrador named Riley. He has developed pretty decent arthritis in the last few years. We had been using the Trader Joe's Chewable Glucosomine and Chondroitin pills for dogs for about a year and they had worked for a while. Then we moved on to these, as my mom had carpal tunnel and tendonitis for a while, and used Conquer to help lubricate her joints and ease her pain. So when we heard of these chewable ones for dogs we bought them. They seemed to be the ""next step up"" from the Trader Joe's ones. They worked for a year as well, where Riley could walk pretty well, seemingly without pain, or much limping. Then we had to upgrade again, to a different variety of these Conquer K9 pills, for older, overweight dogs, that was some kind of super formula that I cannot seem to remember the name of, nor could I find again after we ran out of the first two bottles. This worked amazingly well, allowing Riley to move like his old self. Now we are using these particular Conquer pills, in conjunction with human Glucosomine and Chondroition pills. These two types of pills together seem to really be helping. He isn't his old self; nor does he walk as well as he did when he was on the super Conquer, but he does not seem to be in pain, and limps very rarely. He is 11 years old; one can expect him to move slowly. I would recommend this product to anyone before trying the prescription strength dog arthritis ""helpers"", with all their side-effects. Definitely give this a try!",dogs,3
"Bought two large (22 x 28"") K&H; heating mats about three years ago, and both stopped working after about a year or two of winter use. They're nice mats -- just don't stand up to ordinary use. The mats come with a year warranty so returning them isn't an option now. I did buy another recently, but thinking I should've spent a little extra money to purchase a Kane heating mat instead as I've heard good things about Kane; that they're durable, and often used on farms.Kane heating mats",dogs,3
"This is one tough finger toothbrush, it's very hard rubber? plastic? and will not flex when it is on your finger. The brush ""nubbins"" work well, but it's uncomfortable for me to use in my 20 pound dog's mouth. It's bigger than my finger, and slides around while it's on.I would not recommend this particular product.",dogs,3
"Maybe my expectations were too high, but based on the reviews I thought it would strap in securely and have some kind of harness attachment mechanism (even just a loop would have worked) but it did neither.The only way it is secured in place is with the seat belt crossing one corner of the back part. All it takes is a sudden stop at 25 mph to tilt and cause my dog to fall off the seat. It works fine as a regular booster seat, but provides no safety for my 12 lbs. min pin mix. Plus he doesn't even like sitting in it, and hops out and climbs into my lap as soon as we start moving (whether it's in the front or back seat).So now it's just taking up room in the back seat of my car, until we've got enough room for it in the can on trash day. It's too bad, because I really need a safe, secure car seat for my dog.Why two stars? Because it seems well constructed (though poorly designed) so I would have felt bad about giving them less.",dogs,3
"I gave this one star only because it is unusable in my case. My bobtail cat was highly sensitive to something in this litter and basically just laid around licking her belly all day. The belly fur came off and she just seemed lethargic and miserable to boot. I was about to take her to the vet and thought I'd give litter switch a try as I'd read elsewhere that this litter has affected other cat's in a similar way. Switched to Arm and Hammer and within HOURS not days, the licking stopped. Her hair grew back in a couple of weeks and she started behaving like a happy, little furball again.",cats,2
"I do not have cats, but I used this products for my two large rabbits who pee a lot. I saw TWBCL commercial on TV and decided to give it a try. I must say we were very impressed that it completely masked the smell of urine in their cages. Though a bit loose, it does clump well enough to scoop out. I've read other comments on the smell. I agree with another commenter that it smells like being around a barn. Not a pungent scent, but raw and natural...like hay bales and corn. (Not surprising.)Pros:-Hides or prevents urine/ammonia scent. (No funky odors greeted you when you entered the room.)-No perfumes or other harmful chemicals. (By rabbits' runny eyes and noses cleared up.)-No dust issues or sneezing spells with the rabbits.-Biodegradable and clumps.Cons:-It's more expensive than I want to pay regularly. (I went through a 7 lb bag in 1.5 weeks.)-Litter doesn't flush too well. (Toilet started to back up a little, so I stopped flushing it.)Final note",cats,2

"We got this for our puppy pretty young (I think around 8 weeks old), and he had it figured out within a few weeks. Some owners have complained that their heavy chewers rip this one up quickly; ours isn't a heavy chewer so we haven't had that issue. At 7 months (and plus another 60 or so pounds), we haven't had any issue with him chewing it up/ destroying it, and it's a great way to keep him entertained for half hour to an hour (depending how many treats you put in it!). I find it works best--AKA keeps him entertained longer--with smaller kibble-sized treats, as they take a little longer to get out of it!",dogs,3
"We have 2 dogs, one 65 lbs, the other 30 lbs. They are both squirrel hunters and blast out of the house at high speed when they see a squirrel. This year we bought new, larger dog doors from Dogmate to better accomodate our 65lb hound. In 8 months, 2 of the plastic flaps for the large Dogmate dog doors have been broken in half, pieces flying everywhere, as the dogs head out on the chase for squirrels. I would not recommend these doors for anyone who doesn't have a geriatric, or sedentary dog, the plastic just doesn't hold up to the stresses of doggy enthusiam. Now we will have to replace our house doors in order to get new dog doors installed. We will be replacing the Dogmate dog doors with ones from a different company that have rubber flaps. We will also look for metal frame dog doors this time, the plastic on these doors is really low quality.",dogs,3
"I have a Beagle, a Cocker, and a Dacshund mix. The medium works for the first two and the small is perfect for the little guy.Postive:My dog would eat so fast that I was sure he never chewed. All three dogs eat at the same time and the Beagle would always finish first and then pressure the others for thier food. This caused the Cocker to eat a little faster too. I am glad I saw these on a TV show recently. They work!!My Beagle has slowed down considerably. He HAS to slow down just to get to all the bits around the center prongs. I hope it keeps working. We have been using it for 2 weeks and I just ordered more for my niece to use with her 3 dogs.Needs Improvement:The bowls need to be weighted down. They are too light. With the dog having to move his nose around the prongs, it moves the bowl more than a standard bowl. Adding some weight would help.My dad is working on a raised platform to use with the bowls. That will give the benefit of feeding the dogs at their best level AND holding the bowls in place on the stand.I highly recommend these to anyone with dogs who eat so fast that they regurge thier food as soon as they are done.",cats,2
"This is not something you pull out of the box and can set up easily. It has a very odd mechanism to release the food, which I could never figure out.

"After having a car accident and realizing the airbags would NOT be a good thing for my dog I got her this car seat. I was afraid she would hate it but she took to it right away! She normally moves around a lot, wouldn't sit still and always wanted on my lap, but after a few minutes in the seat she was content to watch out the window or just lay down nice a comfy facing the front of the car. I have a large (and fat) chihuahua, almost 15 lbs, she has enough room to lay comfortably while strapped to the belt. This car seat makes for much easier traveling on the both of us.",dogs,3

"I bought this feeder (after researching many, many products...none of which met my specs) so that my cat would have food on a slow, steady, regular schedule. My cat has a sensitive stomach so he would often scarf his food and immediately throw it up. This had been the bane of my existence for years. Until now. Now he gets fed the same tiny amount of food every 2 hours, He's a healthy kitty and I'm able to leave the house.Two main selling points for me:1) It dispenses only the small amount of food that my cat can handle (you could put in a lot more food if you wished.)2) I can set it for any time of day, in any increments.Fortunately my cat has not figured out how to forward the tray and hopefully it will stay that way. I do wish there was a small sound or bell when the tray rotates. True the rotation is a little noisy itself but sometimes that isn't quite loud enough if my cat is in another room, napping, etc. Also, I don't think it is complicated to set the clock at all. Fairly clear instructions are included.Btw, I liked it so much that I bought a second one a month later.",cats,2

We had put a squeaker in it from a squeaky toy, and I think that just sent him in overdrive to get it out... It seemed like the perfect indestructible squeaker toy.

We have the blue, and the larger pink. Our babies go everywhere with us, including restaurants with outdoor seating. If you are reading this to help decide if you should purchase it, I definitely suggest YES. I have not come across any problems what so ever, except one of my babies is a chewer, and she chewed through the mesh around the zipper, but I just sewed it up with a very thick black thread, and keep my eyes on her.

This shampoo really helps my dog and his itchy skin. I've been using it regularly on him for a little over a year. He used to scratch and chew himself until he bled but not anymore. His skin has healed and his hair has grown back. Great stuff.,cats,2
"After reading the reviews, I decided to give these collars a try. I found the review by M. Raymer ""Crazy Cat Lady"" especially helpful. The clasp on the 4 collars I got seemed to be just the right strength. One cat has gotten out of the collar once (collar broke away just as it should), but hasn't done it since. I find the clasp opens best for humans if you apply a slight upward pressure with your thumb, not just trying to pull it apart.I agree that the collars loosen up too easily. Per M. Raymer's recommendation, I pulled out the pliers and squeezed the sliding metal connectors to tighten them up once they were adjusted to my cat. I think these connectors need some real work - they move too easily, are cumbersome compared to the rest of the collar, and the edges are too sharp.All in all the best alternative I've found, but it still needs work!",cats,2
"This item was received quickly and brand new as advertised. It works great! We have a German Shepherd who sheds like CRAZY... It takes out tons of that fluffy undercoat and leaves her looking sleek and well-groomed. And, she loves it! You do have to be careful on the more tender areas such as the belly, and I would recommend doing this outdoors on a breezy day because you will get gobs and gobs of fur. Either that, or keep a large trash can handy. This tool has definitely reduced the amount of dog hair ""tumbleweeds"" in our home.",cats,2
"My cat, who absolutely adores dried catnip, has not been attracted to anthing I've sprayed with this spray. I might as well just have sprayed air or water on things.I am sorry I purchased this spray, wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and definitely won't buy it again.",cats,2

"I'm very happy with the indoor/outdoor plastic pet pen. I have a little three-pound puppy and this contains her very well, while getting her outside in the nice weather. Gives me a break from watching her every minute too. She will only get to be about twice as big as now so I expect I'll be using the pen for quite some time. I ordered two more panels to give her a bit more room to play in. The quality is good, and it is lightweight and easy to move around. Also, super easy to put together. Thanks for a great product.",dogs,3
"I purchased this product for my two cats. It worked for about 2 days then it started moving without anything in the box just back and forth back and forth, so I had to unplug it for a couple days. Then I pluged it back in and it worked for another 2 days and started to do the same thing. My advise is don't get this product get a cat box that works manual or electronic.",cats,2
"This fountain runs as loud as the refrigerator, even with a cloth pad under it to try to deaden the motor noise. One reviewer said he/she had wrapped bubble wrap around the motor... Luckily, instead of purchasing this item I borrowed it from a friend whose cats didn't use it enough to warrant the cleaning process and she had it sitting in a closet. As far as set up goes, the motor is difficult to push into the opening far enough to seat it properly. I have ordered the stainless steel Big Max by Pioneer because the reviews say the motor is virtually silent.",cats,2
"Here are the problems associated with keeping a betta (or any fish) in a small amount of water:1, Size. Bettas can grow up to 3.5&quot;, this tank is 4&quot; in diameter, sound like a tight fit to you? Also, bettas do not &quot;love&quot; to live in small spaces. They are much happier in larger amounts of water. Mine lives happily w/ all my other fish in my 20 gallon, and another happy in his 2 gallon.2, There is no filtration. You would have to do 100% water changes DAILY, which may be stressful for the fish. However, not changing the water daily would result in deadly ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite levels, which are toxic to fish.3, Temperature & Water Chemistry. It is very hard to keep a constant temperature in such a small tank, as the temperature can change within minutes, which can result in death. Same goes w/ the water chemistry.Bettas live in those small cups at pet stores because if put together, they will most likely kill each other. These cups are not meant to be their permanent homes, they are just a cheap, easy way to keep them separated.I don't mean to bash this product, I just don't think that it is an appropriate home for a fish. As said before, there is a larger Sponge Bob tank available that would be much better for a betta. Please do your research first!",fish aquatic pets,4
"This coat has kept my dog nice and warm, it's super cute too, it looks like it's layered with a striped t-shirt underneath, but it's all one piece. I would recommend, unless your dog has a large chest, then you may not be able to snap it all the way.",dogs,3
"When I opened the box everything was in perfect condition and the cage was much bigger then I had imagined, which is awesome! It is the perfect size for my 2 rats, they have lots of room to run around and climb!The only thing I would say to be careful for, is if you have rats under probably 6 weeks old, they might be able to squeeze through the bars. I was a little concerned at first when I put my 3 month old in, but he can't get through them!Great product, I'm a very satisfied customer :D",bunny rabbit central,1
"I have had Midwest Quiet Time Pet Beds since I got my puppies in 2003. I had mostly used the Fleece ones but then I found the Gray ones and they were perfect. They helped hide the dirt and stains. Then in June I saw the Cinnamon ones and decided it would look better. I purchased 2 of 36 x 23 beds....from the beginning they started shedding. I washed them several times hoping that they would stop shedding. My dogs always had fuzz on them and it was all over the house. After a few weeks of washing them thinking they would stop shedding, there were some bare spots. This was the worst product I ever bought. I was so disappointed in this product. It was a good thing I kept the gray ones....I am still using them 5 years later and even though they are starting to wear through they are better than the cinnamon ones.",dogs,3

"Went straight from the box to the recycling bin since it was now too mangled to return. Nothing fit together properly so I had to resort to taping the plastic parts inorder to get them to hold their configuration long enough to line up with the base. Then the cage bars wouldn't slide into the plastic. I gave up and bought a Crittertrail system which went together like magic. The Habitrail system, however, is made of very thin plastic and is poorly engineered. I'll never buy another product from this line.",fish aquatic pets,4
"My husband and I currently own a 3 year old, 135 pound Great Dame. She tore BOTH her ACLs and has had her first surgery 5 weeks ago. My husband has a 90's Jeep and I have a 2007 Ford Escape. He was tiring and hurting his back having to lift her to all our appointments. Finally we saw someone using an item such as this at the vet clinic. We have had it only three weeks and it is a 100% necessity! It is a bit more of a steep incline for my car but as long as you have two people on either side, she still gets up with a bit of a muster. We also use this for our front door (we have one step from our porch to our outdoor walk way) and she is now use to it. I see that others mention it is heavy... well not has heavy as a Great Dane... and it is good way to build some muscle! It does take up quite a bit of room in the car YET it is easy to fold and carry like a briefcase. You wont regret this item!!",dogs,3

"I agree with a previous reviewer that this toy is best for a medium-sized dog. The goose is a little plump so it's harder for a smaller dog to squeak it. I have a medium-sized dog and his specialty is ripping the squeaker and stuffing out of toys. I continue to purchase the AKC toys because they are more realistic looking (rather than crazy, brightly colored toys). If you're dog is a ""killer"" these AKC toys are very easy to tear apart, but luckily they're cute and fairly cheap so I don't mind. If your dog is the opposite and never tears squeakers out then this toy is even better.",dogs,3
"My puppy is 3 pounds. She's not very destructive, and is rather small (Yorkie-Bichon mix). She destroyed these balls in a few days. What comes out of them is plastic-y cottony material that she can choke on, and even better, lots of small plastic parts that are perfect for choking her to death. I'm astounded that she was able to destroy this thing in a matter of days, and even more astounded that it's full of small plastic parts just the right size to kill her. I'm more than a bit ticked. Do not buy this.",dogs,3
"I've been using this on my dog for almost 5 years. She never has fleas or ticks. The only drawback is that it looks kind of bad for a few days after applying. Even though I get it down under her fur onto her skin, (she's a lab/boxer mix) there seems to be a film on her back fur that picks up dust and dirt. It also smells. And you have to wait a few days before bathing your dog. But it's worth it to not have any fleas! And never any side effects on my dog. I'm sticking with this product.",dogs,3
This is just a plastic stick with some scrap fabric on the end and they are charging 5 bucks for it? Does no one else find this LUDICROUS? Your cat does not need this kind of investment to live out its ribbon dancing fantasies... Do yourself a favor and make this instead:Step 1,cats,2

My cat and the next door neighbours cat enjoy eating this stuff. They were a bit unsure at the start but after a few days they gulp it down with gusto. If they want some fresh meat then they can always eat some hoppers or rodents. I mean what sense is it to continue rapping the oceans for food when we have enough in the plant world?I know it sounds crazy but how about we stop using rodenticides and start feeding our cats vegan and if they are still hungry letting them supplement their diet with rodents lol!,cats,2
"I had a chewman toy years ago for my goldens, and remembered it as being the one toy they consistently played with. We have a new puppy in the house, and chewman continues to be a winner. Not quite sure what it is about this toy, but as soon as we showed it to our 12 week old retriever mix, he grabbed it in his mouth and walked around the house with it. Not only does he like to carry it around, including up and down the stairs, but it lives up to its name, and chewing on it he regularly does. A week after purchase, with daily use, it still looks as good as the day it arrived.Contrary to some negative comments from others about the squeaker causing dogs to destroy the toy in an attempt to look for it, when my pup discovered the squeak, he was delighted, and continues to take delight ever time the toy makes a noise. Also, chewman has been through the washing machine, and has come out looking as good as new. Highly recommend.",dogs,3
"Panacur is an excellent broad spectrum dewormer and is one of the few things that will work to successfully wipe out Giardia. When I brought my two Pyrs home, both were suffering from it. A trip to the vet did no good... I don't even recall what they were prescribed, but it was useless. I did some independent research online and found that many had had success treating Giardia with Panacur. Bought it and low and behold, within a few days the giardia was gone and my pooches were pooping normal again... I treated them for a full 5 days, which is what I read the Giardia regimen to be. MAKE SURE you weigh them and buy the proper amount. Too little won't do anything and will be a waste of money.",dogs,3

"I bought two of these beds over 18 months ago. At that point, we had two ""medium"" dogs that weighed about 30 and 35 lbs. The beds were perfect for them. Six months ago, we got a German Shepherd puppy, who has grown to about 70lbs. He loves to jump onto the bed. I had to start tightening the bolts every few days, which I have found out is not only due to them loosening, but also because the bolts are actually ""stretching"". One stretched to about 1/2 the thickness that it was originally (right above the threads) and just broke on the last tightening. I know the bed shouldn't have to survive a 70lb GSD ""puppy"" jumping on it, but I'm disappointed that the bolts are not made of ""hardened"" material. They should not stretch. Luckily, I have two beds and will use one for parts and hopefully get a few more months out of it.This bed would be so much better if the manufacturer had two parallel rails on each of the three sides instead of just one. This would minimize the stress at the bolts. That actually just gave me the idea to try to build one ""frankenbed"" out of the two beds I have.",dogs,3

"Compaired to the immediate results of the Zymox shampoo, this stuff is okay. I know each pet allergy situation may vary; however I have tried this after bath, and between. It doesn't add protection, in my dogs case; for he loves to roll around in the stuff that gives him hives; grass! Zymox med shampoo, and zyrtec, or the generic brand, works fabuluosly.

"I am owned by a rambunctious, precious, spoiled and slightly psychotic Shitzu. And this is one of the best gifts I've given her.You twist open the two pieces (like a big, purple, rubber Oreo cookie) and then fill it up with small treats. I use flat disc type treats but the great thing is that you can adjust the opening for any style of bite-size rewards. This is also good so that you can start out by letting one fall out when you roll it across the floor, let the dog know what's inside, and then take it back and twist it a little tighter so that they now have to work a little harder for them.. Happy torture!It's very durably constructed for a small dog but I don't know about bigger breeds. All I know is that my dog loves it.",dogs,3

"In my estimation, the Premier Squirrel Dude is the best designed treat filled toy. The plastic is strong enough to withstand strong and extensive chewing and the hole which has three little teeth (that can be trimmed if necessary) keeps all kinds of kibble treats from just falling out.

"Tuf foot is a great product in my opinion. I've been through several bottles of this during training. My method for application is simple and effective. Buy a empty spray bottle and a bottle of isopropyl alcohol (aka rubbing alcohol). I fill the spray bottle with a 5/1 ratio mix of Tuf foot and alcohol. The addition of the alcohol is simply to dilute the Tuf foot mixture to make it last a little longer. The spray bottle method is MUCH better than using cotton swabs, spilling it on your foot, or any other method. The benefits are; you get better coverage with less product, you don't get it on your hands, it's faster, and it gets in-between the toes easier. I suggest using it twice a day, for the first week to two weeks (depending on how tough your feet are already). Once a day is good after that. I apply before bed, and after my post morning workout shower. If you use it twice a day there might be a slight change in skin tone. It's not ugly or permanent. Tuf foot will NOT toughen your feet to leather, only hard miles in your shoes/boots will do that, but it sure helps. Word of caution",dogs,3
"I bought this product for my 1.5 year old cat, hoping it would be a welcome addition to his toy box. My cat is more than enamored with the bubbles. Not vocal by nature, he begins to meow quite loudly when he sees the container of bubbles. He loves to chase after the bubbles and bite them when they hit the ground. As other reviewers have stated, these bubbles last quite long - much longer than soap bubbles. This allows a single blow of the bubble wand to be enjoyed for many minutes. The popped bubbles do leave a bit of debris behind, but I have found it isn't really that sticky, so I can simply pick it up off of the carpet. They do sometimes get stuck in my cat's fur, but he likes to lick the residue out, so no problem there! I highly recommend giving this item a try! My cat definitely thanks me for the purchase.",dogs,3

For $20 I bought this, took it home and had hope for about 7 minutes. She got the treat out, and I messed up by pushing it in too hard, and getting it stuck in between the 2 sides. (In theory, this was the most amount of time the toy went without having the treat popped out.) After she licked at that for a while, I was able to push the treat out and get it back to the place that it belonged. Pop. Pop. Pop. She is now a pro treat grabber, who can get these everlasting discs out within 3 seconds flat. 2 if you don't count the time she sniffed at it. Now I have a $20 ball to play fetch with.",dogs,3

She's smart and strong but I couldn't believe that the unit was so poorly built. Further investigation revealed that the timer wasn't snapped firmly down onto the tabs in the base. It takes a little wiggling to get the slots on the timer lined up with the tabs in the base. Once aligned you have to push down pretty hard to make the tabs snap into place.

My husband sprays the yard about once a month, I spray the dogs each week and our horses when needed. You can not use it on cats. Our tick problem was so bad we could not walk outside without getting 10 or more ticks on us. We have a lot of deer that walk through our property which was a big part of our problem. It is so nice to go outside in bare feet and not covered with bug spray. I can buy this locally for $22 so this is a good buy. The delivery time was fast too. I have just started using it on dirt dabbers and wasps, works great on them too.",dogs,3

I have been purchasing Blue Buffalo indoor cat food for some time now and my cats absolutely love it. I first started them off on Wellness hard food but for some reason it gave one of my cats diarrhea. (He does have IBS flare ups at times) I wanted to stick with the natural lines so I tried Blue Buffalo next and it was a great fit! All three of my cats get this hard food and they enjoy it.,cats,2
"My 25 lb. cocker/eskimo had this toy shredded in less than a day. Granted, she does tend to chew her toys up, but I wrongly assumed from the other reviews that this one just might last....not so!!! If your dog tends to chew up toys, this is not the toy for you!",dogs,3
"The first Penguin Bio Wheel 350 that I bought for my 55 gallon worked 2 1/2 years flawlessly. Then after changing the water in my tank back in January it died. I tried everything customer service recommended, but it just wouldn't work. I bought another from my local pet store that day. Three months later, after unplugging it to clean my tank, it too died. I could hear the motor, but it just wouldn't run. Yes, I added water to the reservoir before plugging it back in. Again, I called customer service, did everything they suggested and nothing. I needed a filter system fast and called the local store where I bought it and they kindly let me trade it in for another one.That was April. It is now July. I unplugged it for one second this morning and now it won't come back on. I tried cleaning every square inch of the filter, the propeller, the housing, called customer service, and they were no help. The lady was quite rude, actually.I'm now forced to buy a new system today in order to save my fish. I don't have the time to wait to order online. I will not buy from Penguin again, as there is definitely something wrong with this model and their customer service. I kept everything clean and well-maintained. It's a shame, because it is a great filter system when it works.The first unit that did last 2 1/2 years had a different box. Perhaps they changed the model in some way, cheaper parts perhaps, that makes it inferior to the one I bought 3 years ago. Anyhow, I felt compelled to leave this review so this doesn't happen to someone else.",fish aquatic pets,4

We are really happy with it, it truly is worth the money. We have seen a decrease of hair in the house since we have begun using the Furminator. Would definitley recommend.",cats,2
I have purchased these in the past and they were great. I like that the packages were much bigger and cost less then I could find them locally. This time when I purchased them the disc's were about the size of a very small pea (like a pellet) not like before were they were about the size of a dime. They would work fine for small fish but are a pain for me since I have several very large ones and have to put 16 in my tank versus the 4 I used to do. Amazon was good about the return but I really wish the product would have stated that they had changed the size and I would not have ordered them.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I've had this cargo liner 9 months and I have used it daily for my Golden Retriever. It has held up excellent and I am very happy with it. He is a big chewer and has destroyed many stuffed toys, beds, chew toys but he has never bit a hole in this or destroyed it in any way. I do not use it as a Cargo Liner, I just drape it across the back seat of my Ford Explorer so I can't speak about how it ""fits"" the cargo liner area.It has kept my seats clean and I usually only have to shake it off to clean it, but I have washed it several times and it's held up great from both the washer and dryer. I highly recommend this product.",dogs,3
"This product works exactly as advertised, and on a very tough case. I cannot recommend this highly enough.We adopted a 6-year old hound dog rescue with absolutely no training on a leash; she was largely kept in a kennel and used as a breeding dog. Traditional leash training was not working, because she had never even learned to respond to her name and she had no sense that she needed to pay attention to the human she was with. She was all but impossible to walk. Even though she was only 50 pounds, after two weeks, I had developed a shoulder injury from walking her. That is when I thought I would try this product. I gave her lots of treats and praise when I first put on the collar, and although she did test it several times (try to bat it off her nose), she accepted it quickly.Because the collar redirected her head to me whenever she tried to pull, I found that working with her on this leash ALSO improved other skills. We started making progress on ""come"" and she began to learn that she needed to watch me to learn the rules of her new environment. Most of all, walks were no longer battles, and we both started to enjoy them. I could relax and walk without tensing for a lunge, and she no longer fought and choked against her collar. After one day, I was able to walk her with our other dog. Now SHE is the easier one to walk!The leash is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I thought the training guide was both clear and to the point. I do recommend letting the dog try the collar on once or twice before walking her with it. Give lots of praise and treats each time, and then she will accept it faster. Now, our hound gets excited when she sees the collar because she knows it means a walk.",dogs,3
I really like this gate. I am in the process of ordering another one. It was easy to install and seems quite sturdy. I have a 4 month old Brittany and at 25 lbs. he can still fit through the cat door so it has to remain closed for a while more. Very good product and good price,dogs,3
"after reading the reviews and giving careful consideration to which crate to buy for a longterm crate for my english bulldog puppy as he grows, i chose this..i got the 36"" one..it arrived quickly but was bent in several places..in other words, the wire is not very sturdy and due to the bends, the sides do not all line up as they should..i was sort of stuck keeping it as i had returned the smaller one i had to walmart..this is cheap price-wise, but so is the quality..if my dog wanted to, he could bang it and/or bite it and cz more damage..the locks dont lock correctly due to the warping of the bent wire..if it lasts a few years, i guess it would be worth it..but i will not move it as it just wont hold up to movement..",dogs,3

For some reason the one I have will only work with the battery power. The electric cord just won't work. Again, I'll stress how loud it is. I would only recommend it because of the price and it works for traveling in a car if you wrap it in towels to smother the noise.",fish aquatic pets,4
My silly cat thinks he's human and needed to drink from a glass while the water ran in the sink. I got really tired of going to pour him a glass every time he needed a sip of water.

I just took that out and problem solved.,cats,2

"The Hikari Sinking Carnivore Pellet is a decent quality pellet for medium carnivores. I appreciate that the pellets don't quickly dissolve in water and it seems my fish really like munching on them. I use them to feed my 3 woodcats (which will eat just about anything) and my vampire pleco (which has been a fairly finicky eater) but all my fish enjoy them.No real downside to the Hikari Sinking pellets (maybe they could have a slightly higher protein content) overall they are a high quality food that my fish really respond to. The packaging leaves a little to be desired; I would prefer a solid container as opposed to the bag but that doesn't really influence the food quality, so it is just a minor inconvenience.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Beware This Dog Bed! I don't think my Chihuahua likes it much. She hadn't peed in the house for two months or in her bed for three months. I felt she was finally house broken. Then, in less than a week, she peed in this new bed. Yes, the cover is washable. But it's as thin as a pillow-case. What is inside is nothing but a shaped piece of foam with a heater embed in it. In only one week, my Chihuahua puppy has managed to pull hundreds, if not thousands of pieces from the foam without even yet tearing through the cover. When I took the cover off to wash it I had to use a vacuum to get all the pieces of foam off the inside of the cover so they wouldn't clog up my washing machine. Getting the cover back over the molded foam is a project all its own. My puppy hasn't peed in the house again in the few days I've been drying out the hosed down foam mold. We'll see what happens when I try it again one more time. But I wouldn't recommend this bed to anyone. At the very least it needs a heavier shaped cover to prevent a dog from digging through it and to facilitate putting back on after removal.",cats,2

"I am so relieved to find this formula. I have two cats that the vet had on Science Diet that we had to buy from him. When my husband researched it, we found that this formula was almost identical. They like it but do't overeat it. It is a fraction of the price, especially with Amazon Prime and Subscribe & Save. They have been on it for several months now and show no signs of any health problems. We want to switch them to a wet food as they might lose weight, but one is a juvenile diabetic that positively refuses wet food, so this is the only option. I am so glad to find this. I am afraid to do the math of how much we wasted on that vet version over the last 8 years! Thank you, Purina!",dogs,3
"We love it. The only thing is that it doesn't always pick up the small pieces but otherwise, it is AWESOME!",dogs,3

Worth every penny. I wish I had known about this stuff a couple of years ago when my tank crashed when it was over taken with green hair algae(it was a beautiful tank).

"1. The bottle dispenses only a VERY small amount of water and a VERY slow rate. Even when you squeeze it with force nothing comes out!2. In order to have the water dispense into the tray, you have to unlock the bottle, turn it upright and lock into place. Once the water container is in place it is useless (see comment 1)3. When locked into place (not dispensing water) it is supposed to be leak proof. Not at all. It leaks. So when I put in it my backpack, everything was wet. I honestly believe that the thing dispenses more water when it's NOT supposed to than when it is supposed to.4. You can't really set it down to have your dog drink out of it because it falls over. Wouldn't be a big deal if it actually dispensed water.So, keeping all of these points in mind, what I did on my day at the park is the following:I tied this thing to my bike's handle bars with the included rope (which is waaaaay to long...I had to wrap it around my bars about 10 times) so it wouldn't leak on me. Instead it kept hitting me in the knee as I rode along to the dog park. When my dog got thirsty, I then spent 5 minutes untying my knot. I grabbed the water bottle, took the top off and poured it into my dogs mouth. Messing with the tray is a joke. Honestly, once again, it doesn't work.It's basically a water bottle. So get a safe plastic water bottle at someplace cheap like Walmart for $2 and just pour it down your dogs mouth....or if you want something that is ""clever and useful"" for a day with your dog, stay away from this thing.",dogs,3

"When we took our then-new bird in for a checkup and told our vet that we had already transitioned him from a seed-mix to his Roudybush she was so surprised and happy. She suggested we might supplement his diet (""his"" being our maroon-bellied conure) with some Nutriberries for fun, variety, foraging toys, and maybe a few extra calories (because he does tend to be a few grams underweight) - but Roudybush is hands-down the best food for birds. Their website has instructions for a few different ways to transition your bird onto this diet, but he had no problem with the first method we tried - namely, replacing his seeds with this 100% on the first day and seeing what happened.He was on colored Zupreem pellets for a little while before being on Roudybush and he didn't like them NEARLY as much as he likes this. Plus, the Zupreem made his poop turn rainbow colors that actually stained clothing purple, green, orange, yellow, reddish......nope, Roudybush is the winner here.",birds,0

These super thin collars, however, have been working wonderfully. It doesn't seem to be matting my persian's fur nearly as badly (it still rubs a bit, but with the daily brushing and petting around the neck, it really isn't a problem) and my siamese can't tell that it's on her except for the tags jingling. I haven't seen her scratch at it at all.They were easy to adjust, not too loose and not too tight. They look great, and really do look more like a necklace than a tacky cat collar.

I am hoping to see far less hair on the furniture and on the corners. Be gentle - follow the directions to a 'T'. Thanks to a previous reviewer who recommended follow up with a flea comb. That gets the last of any stray hairs. If you have only a short hair, you will probably be surprised at the amount of undercoat it has. I certainly was!

Great to leave around the house so my cat can play on his own too. Great colors, very sturdy, and I like that I don't really have to worry about him breaking them or hurting himself. I have to keep buying more because so many get lost around the house (under the couch especially - that is his favorite game!) and we can never seem to have too many lying around for him. This is my third package so far and I will keep buying these again in the future too!",cats,2
"I wanted a wooden dog house for my Shiba and decided on the Precision Outback. It was shipped via Amazon free super saver and arrived very quickly. The assembly was very straight forward, quick and easy. The structure seems solid and although the product has weather resistant coating, I applied some water sealant on the roofing and outside panels. I also put cut flooring tiles to fit under the dog house 'footing blocks' for additional wet proofing.This seems to be a well manufactured and excellent product.* * * added comment * * *After being outside in constant rainy weather for two days, a section of shingles on the back right side of the roof warped upward to form a hump. I secured them flush to the backing material with brass skrews. I suppose the roofing panel tolerances may be a bit tight and the constant damp weather caused the shingles to expand from the moisture past the point where they would stay flush.Again, I think this is an excellent product and my Shiba seems to like the 'secluded' corner inside the dog house created by the off-set doorway.",dogs,3

We were in the market for something that was funcitonal, inexpensive, airline approved and wasn't too cutesy. This Delta travel bag filled each of those requirements. It works great in general, but I would have been happier if it had a plusher ""sherpa"" lining, and better windows. There are screens open/close over the windows, but when they are rolled up they still cover half the open window.

OH and even though my dog only weighs 20 pounds, I got the medium-large one for dogs up to 77 pounds. I feel it adds more strength and it is NOT that thick and the handle fits my hand perfectly. I would definitely recommend getting this size even if you have a small dog.

My other cat, Maggie, doesn't care for it too much, but she just doesn't like getting brushed in general. I got the larger one for my mom's dog and the equine one for her horses. It works better then any other brush I've ever used. A good example of you only get what you pay for. Highly recommended!",cats,2
"My 10 yr. old schnauzer has suffered with loose, runny stools, sometimes bloody, for several years now. I almost lost him earlier this year when it was so bad that he was on IV's for 2 days. Part of his recovery was due to Pro-Pectalin... a remarkable product. I now give Pro-Pectalin as a daily maintenance dose of 1cc-2cc which keeps his intestinal tract healthy and stools normal. It's much cheaper than trips to the Vet. It's the only medication that I can easily get down my dog...he actually likes the taste. I only wish they made other meds available in this injection style. Price is great and shipping is quick. Don't know what I'd do without Pro-Pectalin.",dogs,3

"This has worked wonderfully for my year-old Belgian Sheepdog, who will keep himself busy with it for quite long periods. I have hard floors, so simply nosing the toy isn't enough to make it tumble and dispense kibble, but he's learned to use his paws and nose to turn it from side to side and get his food. It's been fascinating to watch him puzzle out how it works, getting more sophisticated in his technique over time. It's very tough and takes lots of biting, pawing, and bashing around without showing any signs of wear. He's worked out how to pick it up and drop it, too. Some dogs will love this and others just won't have the patience for it, but the price is certainly reasonable enough to give it a try.",dogs,3

Your dog needs to vocalize! However, it's great for addressing instances of nuisance barking.",dogs,3

"I have 2 siamese cats of different ages. The male, younger cat (7yo) can be aggressive towards the older female (13 yo). I tried everything to make him less aggressive towards her but nothing worked like Feliway plug ins. I LOVE this product and it totally works for my 2 cats. They are both very content when I use it. I can even tell when the plug in runs dry as their bad behavior starts up again. Definitely recommend it. As an FYI - 1 plug in will not work for the whole house. I have one in a large den where they spend most of their time playing, sleeping and hanging out with us. Another in the kitchen (adjacent to den) where their food is. These 2 are enough for calming the cats.",cats,2

"This is one of the simplest, most ingenious aquarium supplies I own. Every time I look at it, it makes me wonder why I hadn't thought of the concept; it seems like something I would have. xD I found it a couple of years ago at one specific fish store, and haven't seen it any other shop or catalog before or since. Which is strange, considering how good it is. My regular handled algae scraper is a pain; of course you get wet trying to reach below a certain point of my vertical 55-gallon tank. Plus, for some unfathomable reason, the handle is hollow, which means it fills with water, and then spills it all over. This product scrapes algae well, but I've never had a problem with it scratching my glass (obviously, according to others, it's not good for acrylic tanks...unfortunately. Hopefully they'll come out with one designed for those.)My only complaint about the thing is that it needs a stronger magnet. It would be good to be able to move it more quickly in any direction without the inside piece floating away, in which case you've got to quickly try to attract it back with the outside half, or else have to manually drag it back to the side to reconnect them before the filter current carries the scraper half off again. Also, since my tank is vertical and hexagonal in shape (an extremely inconvenient style as far as cleaning goes, but my parents bought it when I was very little and hadn't really thought of that) and can't be walked completely around, there are six corners--and you need to move carefully from one glass panel to another. Corners, gravel, objects--they can all cause it to separate. Especially in mine, because again, the parts towards the back and next to our walls can be hard to reach.The only other downside would be if you had something on the outside of the glass that would need to be removed in order to use it. Also, it's obviously only good for cleaning the glass--but you wouldn't really expect it to be able to do anything else in the aquarium!But on the whole, I'm really happy with the little thing. Just plop it in, drag it across the glass, take it out, dry it, put it away! And I have the small Mag-Float (it was the only size available in the store), which will work perfectly on any size aquarium.",fish aquatic pets,4
"Oh my gosh, I wish I had the furminator yrs. ago!!!! I have a yellow Lab that sheds unbelievably. In summer you wouldn't want to pet her b/c you would just be covered with hair!

"I've used Prime for the past 15 years on every fish and shrimp I've kept. It is by far the best on the market, and the most affordable. There may be conditioners that cost less, but consider that normally you need one cap full for every 10 gallons. With Prime, you need one cap full for every 50 gallons or so! For big tank owners, that means I can do a 50% water change on my 120-gallon and use 6ml of Prime vs 30ml of any other product. Even the smallest bottle (100ml) will treat 1,000 gallons!I've read some complaints here of the smell, and it does have a sulphur-like smell. The smell is NOT transferred to the water, and of course goes away when you cap the bottle.This is the only conditioner I'll ever use... it is effective, safe for even my most delicate ornamental shrimp, and by far the most cost-effective product on the market.",fish aquatic pets,4

I've used various potions on my dogs' hot spots for years, everything from Bactine (which works fairly well) to vinegar w. a drop of Betadine (which also works but smells).

The Bactine works, but the Micro-Tek spray seems to work faster at healing the wound and keeping the dog from licking. Great stuff! My sincere thanks to the company!",cats,2
I have a 20 gallon fish tank with six fishes(kois and goldfish) and I wanted a fish feeder for when I go on vacation which is normally about ten days. I used this item and it worked perfectly. You just have to program it for the time of day you want the fish to be fed and it can feed up to two feedings at a time . What happens is the drum just makes two rotations and drops the food. Setting up the feeder is like programming your digital watch so just follow the instructions and all will be fine but dont lose the paper.

"Pros:1. Reflective strap.2. Always retracts to the stop tab (not the clip)3. Easy to lock and unlock the leash with one finger4. Feels and looks sturdy5. I like that it does not retract all the way to the clip. It makes it easier for me to clip it onto my dog's harness.Cons:1. A little heavy for the amount of leash it holds2. Leash is a little short. It would be just as easy for me to wrap a longer, regular leash around my hand and work it manually.3. Tension is a little too much for my 5LB chihuahua. He ends up pulling against it when walking.4. Wrist strap is nice, but I wish it had an adjustable feature on it. I've had it slip off my hand and scared the heck out of my dog. It was not a pretty sight when I was trying to catch him while he was trying to run away from the clattering of the plastic casing. I now twist it after I put it on my wrist to make it snug.Not sure I'd buy this again. It's nice, but maybe for a slightly larger dog.",dogs,3

That was on December 13 and today is December 23 and still no response, even after 3 other emails from me. This company is very, very poor in customer service as well and misleading in their ads.

"I bought the blue model for my Maine Coon Cat, and found it does remove a lot of hair, but the cat for some reason HATES it. Oddly it removes tons of hair even when my cat is not shedding. Typically she will jump up on the toilet seat so I can groom her with a slicker brush. She typically purrs to show her appreciation. However, with the Furminator, the cat acts as though I am trying to mutilate her. Whenever she sees me pick up the Furminator, She shoots straight out of the bathroom and under the bed. So yesterday I took the Furminator to my office and looked at the edge with the microscope. It looks to be basically a cutting edge 40mm long (about 1 and 1/2 inch) like a single edged razor blade, but rather crudely sharpened, with 41 comb-like pointed steel projections, each 3mm long (as measured from the razor edge out to the point) The projections make it impossible for the sharp edges to cut anything but hair,not even the most delicate fold of skin, as the distance between projection points is less than a millimeter. The 41 little cutting edges between the points are actually almost ""V"" shaped, like devices used to cut string. Years ago I carried a device called a Trim Comb when I traveled overseas to give myself haircuts. It was a razor blade in a plastic clam-shell holder with plastic comb-like projections and worked well for keeping my hair at one even length. Furminator seems similar, but with more and shorter teeth, and all milled out of a single block of steel. This device looks to me obviously for CUTTING hair, and, I suspect, has little to do with shedding, except,I suppose, that SHORT hair shed around your house is less obvious than LONG hair shed around your house. I suppose it is possible that, not being as sharp as a razor blade, the Furminator rips some hair out by the root, which may account for my cat's bad reaction, though I think it more likely that the cat realizes she is being given a HAIRCUT instead of being BRUSHED, and she HATES haircuts. Dogs may be more forgiving, but I can't recommend Furminator for cats, if for no other reason than they really don't like it.",cats,2

I washed this item many times and beat it against the house outside but there was just no way to get out the dog hairs that bad become imbedded in the curly material.Also, this is not an item flaw, but my dog chewed on the outer bumper part and pulled out all the stuffing.

"Simple Solutions Pup'sters Washable Diaper Garment, Extra-Extra LargeI had a female dog that started peeing in the house. Turned out she had a thyroid problem, but the peeing inside became a habit before I realized. I tried everything to get rid of the smell and get her to stop to no avail. These were a lifesaver. I bought the extra-large but I had to get the large - one size smaller than she measured for. No problem though. I use the cheap feminine pads. They work great.I only wish they had the diapers in a different color for large. My dog is black and the navy diaper blends in when I'm stumbling out of bed to let them out to pee. Many a time I've forgotten she had them on in the early morning light and let her out and she peed in them. Whoops!

They claim it to have 7 settings. Well it only runs on one 24 clock.. So either you have your daylight lights on or you nighttime lights.. You plus daylight plug into yellow and actinic/nightime into blue plus.. You set the timer for whatever time you want the white lights to run.. then the other nightime lights come on for the remainder of the time until its time for the whites to turn on again.I bought this thinking i could program my daylights to come on at a certain time and then later in the day having my blue lights come on but nope.. doesnt work that way.. You can set it for different times of the week but thats it.. you cant have several times each day.. it was disappointing.. i finally got this answer from Coralife/Central who made this.i'm returning my unit as i do not want a timer that runs 24 hours a day. dont make the mistake of buying this and thinking you can program different times.

"I had this feeder for 10 years before it fell to the floor and shattered. The spring load broke first, within the first year. I had to reset the unit manually (move the ring and red rigger by hand). I had battery issues throughout the life of the unit but I found if I tested the unit several days before going away, I could make sure it worked. By year 4, the unit would skip days, for example, the cat never got to eat meal 2 because the door moved past 2 to meal 3. Occasionally, other days would skip. It got the the point that I had to ask someone to check on the unit every 3 days to make sure the cat was fed. It was impossible to have total comfort that my sweet cat was okay.I only fed female cats using this device (the largest cat was 12 lbs). I read in the other reviews about the cats pushing open the next day. While my cats did this occasionally, it didn't happen every time I used it.

"We are on our third large ""Canine Cooler"" bed and HIGHLY recommend this product for non-chewing hot dogs.We first bought one for our long-haired Belgian Shepherd, who ultimately reached 130lbs. He spent every night of his life going between his ""hot bed"" (a typical foam bed) and his ""cool bed."" Over the course of seven years, we only replaced the Canine Cooler once because the inner sponge has broken into pieces after years of use.Our even-hotter Newfy puppy inherited the used Canine Cooler bed, but chewed on the corner. We taped it up with duct tape, but once he was six months old, we got him a new one and he now spends his nights going between his softer Canine Cooler cool bed and his harder - but even cooler - marble slab. (Yes, he has several big soft dog beds, but he finds them too hot to lay on for more than a minute or two unless he's wet from a bath or swim.)Like the advertizing says, the Canine Cooler isn't cold, but it is cool and amazingly stays cool when a warm body lays on it. They sell covers for it, but we never use anything over it because it reduces the cool effect that our dogs really need. It's well worth the cost for a hot dog.",dogs,3

"Love this one, it can't disappear under my sofa due to it's size, I fill them with the cats fave treats or just their regular kibble and off they go....it's hard plastic and makes a fair amount of ruckus on a hard floor, so I keep it out of reach at night. Other than that I highly recommend it.",cats,2
I wanted to try this box out because I have 2 cats that are very picky about the litter box. I was cleaning it daily and the smell was strong. I could not afford the electronic scooping box so this looked like my best bet. it is very large and even with the grate inside it is still big enough to accomodate my cats. The rolling action of the box is easy and traps all of the clumps without touching a scooper. After rolling the clumps into the pull out scoop it is very easy to deposit them into a toilet or trash can. I love this product and would recommend it for anyone that hates to clean the catbox and can not afford the expensive electric ones.,cats,2

"I purchased this item to place in the floor of a homemade tub shelter for a stray cat visiting our home.I placed the heater between the bottom of two storage tubs above 1 inch foam insulation with the electric cord exiting a hole in the corner. The entire tub was insulated all around the inner tub, sides and lid. This worked great for 5 months, keeping the internal temperature very nice inside. I am convinced it saved the stray cat's life during a very cold 2011 MN winter.However, during a weekly inspection of the house just last week, I noticed the shelter was very hot inside and the pad overheated and melted the bottoms of both the inner tub and insulation. This was a very dangerous situation as it might have killed the cat and/or started a fire on my deck had it gone unnoticed.",cats,2

"I own six cats and never have found a scratching post that either lasted a week or two, or that drew no interest from my cats. Within an hour of setting up the SmartCat Post, a couple of my cats were stretched out fully scratching away. Clawing at furniture stopped immediately, and I had tried so many sprays and sticky strips to make them stop ruining my furniture. I realize cats are very opinionated, and yours might totally ignore the SmartCat Post. I can only share my experience that my cats love it, my furniture destruction problem is solved, and the post is worth it's rather expensive cost.",cats,2
"I was excited when I received this product, they are nice size and made very durable. I followed directions and added a few drops of dish-soap to the mote and added food and water. I checked it the next morning and it was full of ants!!! What I found was a simple flaw or defect that allowed the ants to get in.. In between the two bowls on the unit there is the piece that separates the bowls and it has a small hole maybe about double size of a pen tip.. This allowed the ants to get in from under the bowl.. Both sets I ordered had this defect.. It looks like it is from part of the manufacturing process, but it was easy to fix with a bit of glue or maybe silicone caulking would work.. Once I sealed the holes they work wonderful.. It is still worth buying, but I hope they fix their process so we don't have to fix it at home..",cats,2

"Our dog chewed at his upper legs constantly. The hair in these areas would stay matted and damp because he chewed so much. We had tried several products including oral medication from the vet. Nothing worked until we found this. We spray a small amount once a day on the hot spots and that controls the itching/scratching/chewing for 24 hours. When our dog sees the bottle, he rolls over in anticipation. It's inexpensive, easy to use and provides him with almost instantaneous relief. We have had no problem with side effects. It does have a distinctive smell, but we don't find it offensive.",dogs,3
"As with other reviews I see here, must agree I am disappointed with the recent change in pad quality from Four Paws. These were the best of all others I had tried, but no longer absorb half as much. I also find more odor in the house and need to change 3 times as often. I would rather pay a higher price for good quality than pay the same for lesser quality and the extra work involved in keeping the house looking and smelling decent. Even my tiny dog has trouble finding a spot that isn't totally saturated. Fortunately, the extra large size hasn't been diminished - yet.",dogs,3
"I put this on my cat and it was gone in a day. I know it's a break away safety collar, but it would have been nice if it had hung in a little bit. My cats not much of a tree climber, but he is a fence scooter under and I think that's where he managed to break out of it.",cats,2

"My bird & I are super happy with this cage. The price I purchased it at was $140 less than similar cages at pet stores. The quality is great for the price, it is well designed and nicely finished, the included bowls and perches are top quality. The seller shipped the product very quickly; the cage arrived well before the initially promised delivery date. It was very well packaged & protected for shipping and arrived undamaged despite UPS beating the heck out of the box. All parts were included, along with some spares, and there was even a small bottle of touch-up paint in the event any rubbing occurred during shipping. Assembly was straight forward and easy, although the directions were a little outdated (some screws shown were replaced with hex bolts instead). The only issue with the cage were the rubber balls on the casters. They were evidently recently produced and producing VERY strong-smelling fumes - not good for your birdie's delicate respiratory system. I set them aside to air out for the time being. A small & easy to fix issue on an overall great purchase. Highly recommend.",birds,0

"Our dog seems to want to bark when it is dark outside (like very early in the morning). We didn't want her to wake the neighbors so decided to try this. It worked great at first; stopped her in her tracks. However, the longer she wore it, the more she got used to it. It does still limit her barking somewhat, but not entirely. It does not take common batteries, so hard to find.",dogs,3
"When we got our puppy 1 1/2 years ago, we were given a used pair of clippers by a friend to try clipping our dog's nails ourselves. Unfortunately, they were dull when I got them, and getting worse every month. I decided to give these a try because the ""safe guard"" feature appealed to me. My dog absolutely HATES having her nails clipped, and I was looking for something that would clip them faster. I have not been disappointed. I have used these clippers for about 2 months now, and they work GREAT! They are sharp, so they cut quickly and easily, and I have not cut my dog's nails to the quick once. I have a treeing walker coonhound with fairly large paws, so this size nail trimmer works great. I have already recommended them to friends. Also, I priced around, and found that Amazon's price was excellent.",dogs,3
"I bought this feeder regardless the negative reviews for my over weight cat. Some time my husband will feed him without knowing that I already did, and he will eat up everything in his food bowl. The instuction is simple enought to just follow the steps to program the feeder. However when I fist plug in the feeder to the timer, the food constantly drop. Then I realize it is on the ""on"" fuunction. I change the ""off"" and to ""auto"" the feeder works great. Later I use the ""on"" fuction to measure exact time and food drop to reprogram the feeder. My other cat love this feeder too, so I bought another one for her (they don't share food.) She is the one learn to paw out the food. I don't worry very much because she can only paw out certain amound of food afterward she can no longer get more, and it is her future portion too. She will not over eats food at all. I giver them smaller amound of food for 4 times a day. My fat cat lost 1 pond for 3 months and he still get 2 more pounds to go. I am very happy with the feeder and give 5 stars.",cats,2

So I shortened the handle all the way, and was very careful not to put too much pressure on it. After about 30 minutes of skimming algae from the pond, I noticed a 2x2 inch hole in the net.

Well, I've used it successfully for my own allergies and many other ailments, so I decided to try it. After a week of a tablespoon in his water, twice a day, the smelly, runny eyes were clear! And I noticed that his general allergies and itchiness seemed to clear up! I had no idea that something I had used for years would work for my dog!

In the same amount of time, two foam beds are all but flattened to less than an inch from their original 4""-5"" heights. I did buy the extra cover for it (it comes with a fleece cover; there are twill ""sheets"" that fit this bed that can be bought separately), that are very easy to take off and wash every week (the fleece-top cover that comes with it is zippered and more time-consuming to take off), and which stand up well to my basset hound's thick nails when he nests. Highly recommended if you need a bed that will stand up to high weights.",dogs,3

"After looking at this for months, I finally got one. Surprisingly, in my experience, it did live up to its hype. We have a (very large) tabby, and like all cats, he sheds constantly. Brushing him with a normal brush took forever, wasn't his idea of a good time, and didn't really work much. We'd get handfuls of fur, but every time you'd pet him, little rafts of loose hair would go flying.When I first set to with the Furminator, I was a little disappointed, as it wasn't working much better than a standard brush. However, our cat didn't seem to mind the Furminator as much as his usual brush, so I just kept brushing. And more hair started to come out, then more, then still more. After a couple minutes of brushing, each stroke would give me a cotton-ball-sized puff of fur, and I kept getting that for a good fifteen minutes of grooming him. He did get sick of it eventually, but by that time we had a pile of fur about as big as him. I've kept doing it every other day since I got the Furminator a week ago, and every day I've been ending up with a softball-sized pile of fur.Overall, I'm really happy with my Furminator. The cat doesn't mind grooming sessions too much, and I'm amazed (and appalled) by the amount of loose fur I brush off of him. I'm also hopeful that I will see a reduction in his hairballs.",cats,2

"I'd previously had a Dr. Noys medium-size teddy bear to play tug-o-war with my 30 lb knee-high sheltie, and after 6 months of tug-o-war, it looked like it had open-heart surgery. Held up quite well (looked perfect for the first 5 months), so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl, as she loves stuffed toys.I don't use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war, as it's a bit too small, she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy (didn't have that problem with the medium size teddy bear).So instead, my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever). When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy, she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it's the best thing ever. She'll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises, and she'll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying ""Since you're down here at my level, play with me!"". Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy, she'll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute, squeaking the toy every couple seconds, just for the joy of it. The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking. She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully. But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.**UPDATE** September 13th, 2008",dogs,3

"I bought this harness for my mini poodle. He's pretty laid back, but I didn't want him to be unsecured in the car in case I had to hit the brakes fast. I also worried about him jumping out the window. I bought a size small for him. He is 15.4 lbs, 13 inches long on his back and 20 inches around in the chest area. The harness easily fit him, in fact it would fit a larger dog with ease I think. I like that the front has the flat, padded section to provide support to his torso in case of braking fast. A regular harness wouldn't do that. What I didn't like it that it is very difficult to attach to a seatbelt that has a shoulder and lap belt combo, like my back seat does. I tried tying a leash to the headrest and clipping him to that, but he had too much freedom and could jump into the back cargo area. Finally I jammed a leash down in the bottom corner of the seat and tied it with about 6 or 8 inches of leash sticking out, and clipped him to that. That worked, and he seemed pleased enough with it. I just think that for $20 (what I paid at Petsmart) you shouldn't have to jury rig the device to make it work correctly.PS I looked through the other reviews and people said it was difficult to put this harness on... I had no trouble at all with it. As I said my poodle is pretty calm, I guess if he hopped around a lot it would be tougher to put a harness on him. But I think a very active dog would probably be better in a carrier anyway for safety reasons. I also think you could attach the harness to the seatbelt, even a lap and shoulder belt, if you purchased a large carabiner hook and used that around the belt and on the loop. People also said their dog chewed through the harness. I agree that probably would happen, it isn't the heaviest weight. Kong makes a similar harness product that is heavier duty, it is about twice as expensive as this one.",dogs,3
"I have a australian shepherd that loves toys, she lives for them, she loves to catch and fetch, she isn't much of a chewer. I've tried all varieties of Kong balls and this football is by far her favorite. I give the product five stars because it is exactly as described, the tennis felt is much thicker than regular tennis balls and there is no squeaker pillow inside of this ball, in fact the way it squeaks is at the tip of this ball there is a very small hole and a plastic squeaker is hidden there, so the way the dog makes these squeak is to simply bite down on it, my dog also likes to push down on it with her nose to make it squeak. This toy is not a chew toy, it is a fetch toy. The plush toys with the squeaker pillow are for me a waste of time, Dakota (my dog) can feel the squeaker pillow with her nose and she immediately sets out to get it and destroys the toy. This toy lasts much longer for her enjoyment than any of the others. I noticed other reviewers were upset their dogs destroyed the toy, if you have a big dog bent on destroying something, it's going to be destroyed, so with that in mind, if your dog loves to catch and fetch, and is a larger dog (this toy is fairly big) this may be the toy for your dog. If your dog likes to sit and chew on a toy, this toy is not for your dog.For small dogs, my mom has 3 pomeranians, and they love the small Kong air squeakers Kong Air Squeaker Tennis Ball Dog Toy small yellow-color 2"" diameter 3-count, they push down on them with their noses to squeak them, they last her dogs for months, because her little dogs like to chew on their toys on occasion and they eventually can get the felt off of these.If you have the expectation that your large dog loves to destroy toys and won't be able to destroy this one, it's not a reasonable expectation. These are more durable, they are tougher than regular toys, but they are not indestructible.If you are looking for something on the tough side, I recommend theKONG Ball Dog Toy, Medium/Large, RedKong rubber ball. I had one of these, had left it in the yard, ran over it with the lawn mower, and it stopped my lawn mower in its tracks. The blade went into the ball and got stuck there. I picked up the ball and it had a small slit at the top. These are about as indestructible as dog toys can get. The downside for us was that the toy is simply not a fetch toy, it's too heavy and not really safe for Dakota to jump up and catch in her mouth. It's meant for chewing.I hope this helps to decide if this toy is for you.",dogs,3
"We used to sleep our Boston Terrier in a travel kennel but we decided he need a little more leg room. We got him a wire crate and a Cratewear set. He used to go to his crate reluctantly at night but now, as soon as he sees his nighttime treat, he bolts into his crate, sits, and waits.We've always given him a treat before bed but he still didn't seem happy to crate up. Now, even when I open the door for him in the morning he just kinda stares at me. ""Um, dude, could you come back in half an hour or so? I'm too comfy to get up just yet.""We're rescuing a cocker mix this June and she'll get the same set up.The only thing that brings it down from 5 Starts is that it's a little expensive for canvas and foam.

"I got this after my cat refused to jump over the plastic version in order to get into the room with her litter box. We really needed a gate to keep the new dog out but let the kitty cat in. Works even better than expected. The gate is high quality materials and production and costs less than the plastic version from PetSmart.The added bonus is that my cat loves her ""special"" door - she goes in and out, rubbing her face on the sides, all day long. She likes that it's just her size and dogs can't follow. With that and the new toys I put in the room, she's been using her litter box consistently.",dogs,3

These are basically like 1/4"" to 1/2"" pieces of skin that have been smoked until cured. Though they are a little crunchy they are more like ummm think of a styrofoam texture.The product was well packaged and I would order from the company again, just would get something different.",dogs,3

"We bought this crate to replace a soft-sided crate that we had before. Our dog scratched his way through the front of the soft-sided crate and that was the end of that. We're currently on a road trip with the Midwest crate and it has been fantastic! Setup and teardown are a breeze. When we drive, our miniature schnauzer, Henry, rides in the back seat, so we just use the optional fleece bed. When we arrive at our destination, we set up the crate and put the bed in it and he instantly has a safe spot that he's familiar with. In fact, he's sleeping there now!If we have to leave him for a while, we just latch the door and know he'll be safe and won't scratch at the door or get into something he shouldn't. At a hotel, I like the idea that he wouldn't surprise a maid that might enter our room while we're out. It's also reassuring to know that he wouldn't be able to get out if the room door were opened.This size crate (30x21x24) seems ideal for him, a 20# dog. The construction is very good and makes the weight of the crate very manageable.",dogs,3

"This would be good for maybe an overweight basset (or even a regular weight basset probably). I got this in an effort to keep my setter from chewing on her stitches and various other places after her surgery.The chewing was a new problem for her and I was hoping that something to prevent her from getting to her preferred chew places while the steroids worked would be useful. The e-collar the vet gave her was too large and not only gave her the impression she could not get through the doggy door but also made her a danger to self and others as she knocked over stacks of books and hit others behind the knees on the stairs.The E-J Collar fit fine and prevented her from getting to her stitches on her belly and the place on her mid back that she was chewing all of the hair off; however, she was able to get to the place around her tail due to the fact she was thin and flexible. So if you have the right dog this is far better than an e-collar and sturdy. The velcro and foam on the collar collect longish dog hair like you wouldn't believe. It now looks white instead of black due to this.Do use the provided band to stabilize it.",dogs,3
"I originally got the Litter Kwitter because that was the only one available at the pet store. It was very well made but did not have many opening options. My cat couldn't go from 0-50% opening.So I looked online and saw this product. I liked that it had perforated widths. I had another cat that I had toilet trained and the kit was similar to this one. He trained in a weekend. This kitty is going on 6 weeks. She did not like graduating from 0-50% and started to pee on the floor and poop in the tub. When I got this product, she took to it very well. I let her get used to each opening for about 2 weeks. It's nice that it has an additional seat. I've had to use it when she wasn't comfortable with the current opening. I keep the second seat one opening less than the one she is on. It's also nice because you can put the toilet seat down onto it and it doesn't lay awkwardly. My only complaint is that the perforations are hard to pop through. You pretty much need scissors cause if you try and pop it out you could split the plastic, like I did. I guess it's necessary because you don't want kitty to be surprised when the hole starts to rip at the seams.Good luck on toilet training.",cats,2

"Wow! That is my first word of this review and my first thought when it arrived. Huge amount of bedding and such a low cost too! I will try and break it down for the rest of my review below -Packaging and ArrivalThis bedding (8.0 cubic inches) came in a pretty big box and was wrapped with a thick plastic. There was a hole about an inch in diameter, but the bedding did not fall out; however, I will say that since it was in a box, it wouldn't have been a big deal if a little had fallen out. So, A+ for packaging!TextureThe texture of this bedding is very fine, although there were some bigger chunks - no biggie, I just picked them out as they weren't hard to find. There may be sharp pieces, but seriously this is not an issue as most wood-based beddings will have this. Plus, I was able to grab a handful and squeeze without slicing my hand, so yes - nicely shaved.OdorThis bedding has virtually no odor, just a slight wood scent but nothing major. It actually smells nicer than those scented beddings! As far as odor control for the animal, I cannot say this yet since I just received and added it to the hamster tank today - but I will update after the first cleaning!Hamster Approval?My Winter White dwarf hamster went absolutely NUTS when I placed her back inside. She started digging like crazy through every inch of that tank and she immediately started making her sleeping area. The fact that this bedding is wood shavings and not a paper-based bedding does not seem to matter. I do add a little Kaytee Clean and Cozy to the mix though, to give her extra softness for her to sleep in.Overall, this bedding so far has exceeded my expectations! I usually get Carefresh for the main areas of the tank and for $50 or more, you get 1/4 of the amount of bedding compared to this Kaytee Aspen bedding. Just amazing.In conclusion, if you are thinking of getting a safe, wood-based alternative - I would recommend this bedding because it truly is an excellent amount for such a small price!",small animals,5
"After a rough day of playing the the yard, my Great Pyrenees retire to the deck to eat and ""bask"". This is the only tie out they've never been able to chew through. You can buy as many $7 and $10 tie outs as you want, but $20 is a small price to pay to protect their lives.",dogs,3
"I bought this unit based on reviews, and the unit itself is stable, however I wish the low flow was a slower stream, and when you put theresevoir on it does leak, no way to tip fast enough. I was also under the impression that the unit filled from the resevoir however I have had to fill at the bowl to keep the unit to the right level. My cats are using it, however they still prefer the toilets. (I adopted abandoned kittens that were left in a house for a long, long time). Maybe with time, cleaning took 40 minutes should be quicker once I get use to it. All in all a good unit.Heather",cats,2
A great product for the larger breed dogs. I have given Jolly Balls as we call them to our Great Danes and this time to our one year old Great Pyrenees and they simply love them.

I got a stray from a animal shelter and it was apparent that walking on a leash was not going to be a fun thing. The gentle leader has saved his neck. he kept pulling for a long time with a regular collar and choking but the gentle leader stopped that almost instantly. Watch the video on how to adjust it. That makes a big difference and watch some youtube videos about how to get them to want to put it on.,dogs,3
"I bought my sister's dog Mr. Bill for Christmas 2 years ago and he is still going strong. Usually my sister's dog chews and rips the stuffing out of all plush toys.

"This is a review for both theTattle Tale Sonic Pet Training Alarmand theCatscram Electronic Cat Repellent.I have a needy cat who HAS to be on the other side of any and all closed doors at all times. If she is inside, she wants out. If she is outside, she wants in. You may think this would be cute, until you're trying to sleep inside the room with the closed door. An open door is not an option because I can't have my eight year old walk in on her step father and I in the middle of the night either. This had been going on for almost a year. I felt my sanity slipping away from me due to lack of sleep. I would regularly pass out sitting up at my desk at work, and get caught in the act! I was on the verge of giving her away (which I hated to do, but I didn't know what else I could do). Then I came to Amazon with my problem, which I do for all my product needs.I had first bought theTattle Tale Sonic Pet Training Alarmafter reading reviews and comparing prices. It worked...very well. I attached it to my door with some command strips. Any time that she pawed at my door the alarm would sound and she would stop. The problem is that it has a very loud tone that is audible to humans and would wake me up. The up side is that she would not continue to paw at the door the rest of the night, so it was a good trade off...I would only be woken up once during the night. It has 2 settings, High and Low. I only used the Low setting which seemed to be very sensitive. I can see how this would be EXTREMELY helpful for dog owners who want to keep their pooch off the couch when they are away. I plan on trying it on my counter top on the High setting to see if it keeps my sister's counter surfing kitty off (update to come).I decided I wanted better. I have to say, I was very skeptical about theCatscram Electronic Cat Repellentat first. The reviews were ok but the price was nearly double what I paid for theTattle Tale Sonic Pet Training Alarm. I decided to take the plunge anyways and I am so glad that I did! I followed the instructions when I first turning it on then set it up in front of my door frame facing across my door. I could tell it was working because my cat was sitting on my bed staring at it with her eyes dilated, which was a good sign. I set her outside my bedroom and closed the door. I went to sleep and woke up 6 hours later! Could it be?! Did I really just sleep 6 hours straight with no interruptions?! You have no idea how happy I was. Maybe there is hope for my sanity yet. The motion sensor on it is sensitive enough to sense movement in very dim lighting conditions so I can also put it inside my bedroom to keep her from trying to get out in the middle of the night and we can still get our cuddle time in.The manual for theCatscram Electronic Cat Repellentdoes mention that it may not work for white cats because their range of hearing is by nature very limited, and also older cats or some exotic breeds may not be affected by it. It works for my little calico though.So the verdict is",dogs,3
"We have a Great Pyrenees whom we bathe at home. Drying time with 2 hair driers took too long, so I bought this Air Force Commander 4hp dryer to get the job done. Its 2-speeds and heater air stream sounded like the solution to drying our dog in a fraction of the time. The unit itself is so LOUD that it was very annoying to us and absolutely alarming to our Pyr. She was so panicked by the sound, that she kept trying to escape the bathroom where we were drying her. Even with the blower unit placed in the adjoining WC, and the air hose fed into the main bathroom, it was still very loud and not pleasant. Other room setups might remedy the noise problem, so when the weather gets warmer, we may try it outside.The unit appears very sturdy and well made. The hose is made of thick material so it seems like it will last. The air flow is strong, even at the lower of the two settings. The higher setting seems to provide more warm air, without the air temp ever seeming too hot. The Air Force unit comes with a number of hose attachments which allow the user to customize the flow of air. This is a nice feature.The air flow produced by the Air Force Commander 2 4hp is strong - leaf blower strong. I'm going to use the Air Force unit to blow out the garage this afternoon. I've also read reviews of people who have purchased this unit to dry their car right after washing, as it blows out all of the water caught in the seams of the body and makes drying your car with a towel nearly unnecessary.If you're a car cleaning fanatic who details their classic collectables - buy this unit. If you're a pet owner who washes their pet at home, buy the smaller, less powerful unit. The 4hp Air Force produces hurricane-strength wind that may be too much for medium and small dogs. I defiantly recommend the Air Force Commander 2 dryer, especially for its versatility.",cats,2
"i bought 1 in august and it ripped apart near the d ring and adjustment bar in less than a month. i thought it was a fluke, so I ordered another one in early September, it ripped again in the EXACT SAME SPOT in less than a month.i really like the design, it does work in helping to lead your dog where they need to be while walking/running. However, two shouldn't have ripped that easily or quickly.I have a 70lb. german wire haired pointer. Yes he is big, yes he is active, but in no way would i describe him as an excessive puller on the leash. i got the harness because he really has a hard time going the same direction i do, meaning he will move to the right while Im trying to go left. so, the harness really did help him gently turn with me. plus its better having any pressure in the front and not on his neck.he is in basic dog obedience and the instructor liked the easy walk harness but had actually recommended another one, should have listened.i liked that the D ring was in the front of the chest and not the back, like a husky pulling a sled.either way, if they decide to make more durable harnesses and i will consider buying another.",dogs,3
"This is an excellent price for this item. Bitter Apple does discourage our Havanese puppy from chewing on whatever we spray Bitter Apple on. She had a small wound on the tip of her tail which our vet told us would be difficult to heal because of its placement. He told us that chewing would be bad for the healing. She wanted to chew the spot so we would spray the tail every 12 hours and she stayed off of it. The tail is now healed. We also used it on a screen door that she wanted to chew on and that discouraged chewing as well. In addition she started tearing up the carpet near the tile juncture; spraying worked there, too. We have heard it does not work on some dogs but it was very effective with ours.",dogs,3

"Loved this box at first (see following) but after awhile it began to fall apart. When you roll it the top separates from the bottom and litter goes all over the floor and the inside comes apart and no longer separates the solids. I finally took the insides out and use the boxes as a regular covered liter box. Sigh. My quest for the perfect litter box continues..(old review) This box requires the least amount of work of any box I have bought. I have spent $100's on mechanical/electric boxes and they all stop working eventually but the Omega is economical and keeps working! My cats (four now) seem to like it and had no trouble adjusting to it. Cleaning is so easy! Just tip and pull out the drawer! You do have to make sure it has been put together correctly and ""locked"" or it will leak litter when turned.... I'm buying my second.",cats,2
"I saw this in a magazine. I wanted a solution because my kitten used to play with water and make it messy. He used to splash water with his paw and the whole floor would be wet. So, I tried this pet fountain. My kitten and dogs love this. I also got the 50 oz attachment also. So now, they have fresh water all the time. My dogs are happy because they don't have carry their empty bowl out to me when they were thirsty. It gets noisy when it needs refilling. I have had it for about 2 weeks now. Maybe it is just a habit from cleaning pet water and food dishes, but I do clean it when I need to add fresh water. Now I only need to give the pets' fresh water every 1 1/2 to 2 days instead of twice or three times a day. Also, I don't have to worry about whether I have filled it up. When it needs refilling, I usually wash it and fill it and the 50oz attachment and it is good for almost 2 days.Oh yes, the kitten doesn't make it messy now.",birds,0

"I've been using the spray on my two dogs' teeth for about 3 weeks. I cannot believe the difference! The older dog (7 yrs) had mild gingivitis which in my opinion is just about gone. The younger dog (2 1/2 yrs) had really bad breath and tartar on her teeth that looked like scale. After using the spray daily for about two weeks, her breath is no longer offensive. I was able to scrape some of the tartar off with a fingernail and now other teeth have white sections starting to show through. I only gave this 4 stars because I am waiting to see what my vet says when the older one goes for her annual exam in Aug. He told me she would need to have professional cleaning. If he says that is not necessary, then I will change the 4 to 5. I am very impressed with this product and will certainly continue this as part of our grooming regime.",cats,2
"This was soft, nice looking, eco-friendly. But what's the use of a dog collar with a plastic loop for the leash that snaps at the first rabbit that crosses the dog's path? My 50 pound mutt easily broke the plastic loop when she was at my friend's house. She had to be tied up for safety while visiting because he doesn't have a fence-- when a bunny showed up she busted through the loop instantly. Thank goodness she came right back but it could have been a tragedy. Don't let this happen to your beloved pet. Get a collar with a metal loop for the lead. You never know.On the plus side, Amazon was great with everything about the return, including funding return shipping.",dogs,3
"I have a Boston Terrier, who likes to chew, but won't just chew on anything. After a bad experience with a tennis ball (that he got hold to) and his intestinal tract, I've been very selective about the toys I give him. A lot of the other pet owners that reviewed here had pets on the upper end of that 50lb scale and my Boston (at adult development) is only around 20lbs, if that. So, I thought I'd give this a try and watch out for complete destruction of the toy. Well, from day 1 when we received this he took to it immediately. I don't know if this has a flavor, but he didn't touch any of the other toys we received the same day... only this one. And, he's chewed on it every day now for about 4 months. Only recently did I begin to notice that he'd finally broken through a corner and I tossed the toy. That white plastic can kill his intestinal organs if it gets in there. So, for the price vs. the length of time it lasted and he enjoyed it without cause, it's an ""ok"" toy. I'm going to buy him another one, but I think the key is to stay vigilant and be sure that once your pet seems to start puncturing through this, it needs to be thrown out immediately. Since he is quite literally never alone, this is not as big an issue as it may be for other pet owners. Please keep this in mind before buying!",dogs,3
"We recently got a new kitten (4 months old) who is always trying to drink water from anywhere BUT his water dish. He's always jumping up to drink out of the bathroom sink, or out of the bath tub, or if some water spills on the floor then he will lick that up too. Anyway, I wished that he was drinking more, but couldn't leave the faucet running all day.He seemed to be a good cat candidate for the drinkwell fountain system since he was into the running water. I bought the drinkwell and the instant that I plugged it in my cat was overjoyed. He was pawing at the stream of water and playing with it. He was drinking straight from the stream, he was drinking from the bowl. Now we have had the drinkwell for five days and he has drank more water than ever before. I had to refill the reservoir this morning because it was getting low! Its amazing, and my cat is no longer jumping into sinks and bath tubs because of it. Sometimes he just sits in front of the drinkwell and watches it like he's wishing he was more thirsty. I swear.I agree with all of the other positive reviews for this product. The sound of the water falling from the fountain is audible but not intrusive or annoying.A tip that I have found about the sound of the motor",cats,2

"I bought this cat furniture and it was delivered with no issues. The first problem I had was setting it up. One of the bolt anchors in the base was deformed and would not accept a bolt. I called General Cage and got them to ship me a new anchor. They were very pleasant and helpful on the phone, and the parts cam promptly.The next issue was the the instructions for attaching the caged ball on top of the structure are wrong. It tells you to use a short bolt instead of a long bolt to attach it to the post below. Well, the short bolt doesn't fit. This wouldn't be much of a problem except that they don't include any spare parts, so I had to call General Cage again. They were helpful again, and agreed that the instructions for the product are crappy. (They do not manufacture the product, they simply import it)The furniture itself is nice looking, though I wish the tent in the middle were a solid house rather than a fabric tent. I don't think it'll take too long for my cat to claw it to shreds. It's not very stable, when my cat's on the top perch it wobbles a lot. It doesn't seem like it'll actually tip over, and he's already jumped from a table directly onto the top perch, but he looks like he's in an earthquake when he's up there. It doesn't seem to bother him that much though, so I may just add a board under the base to give it some more stability. He loves the furry balls, which is amazing since catnip does absolutely nothing for him. The scratching posts are nice too, and allows him to fully stretch out. Finally, the platforms do offer him enough room to lay down on - though they would be a little small for a 15 - 20 pound cat.I bought it for $80, I wouldn't pay more than that for it, and it's simply the hassle of returning it and trying something else sight unseen that keeps me from sending it back. My cat uses it, it's tall, and the platforms are large enough, and in Hawaii there aren't enough local choices to compare.",cats,2
"We have had large and medium sized Coolaroos out in our dog run for several years now. They are the perfect solution for your dog's comfort outdoors. The dogs love them and it keeps them off the wet, cold concrete. As long as you don't have a puppy that wants to chew, this product will last a long time out in the elements. Our puppy chewed ours, but what can you expect...he was chewing everything. Now he is out of that phase and is leaving the Coolaroo alone (except to sleep in it!).In response to some previous reviews, you can find replacement covers for these beds at several other online merchants if you just spend a minute or two searching. Admittedly, these beds are a little tough to get the last bolt in place. That is the point though- the mesh fabric initially has to be very tight.

They answered all e-mails promptly and made it extremely easy to return the item even though I had disposed of the original packaging. Usually under these circumstances I expect a bit of a hassle - NONE whatsoever - they couldn't have been nicer.

"In many ways, this product saved my sanity. My cat, who was abandoned, was absolutely obsessed with food when he came to live with me - he wanted it early, often, and was angry when he didn't receive it. He rapidly went from underweight to overweight, and we were both miserable. Enter the autopetfeeder - he is now a stable weight and a loving cat. It reliably dispenses a very precise amount of food. (I've read the reviews and wonder if some of the owners who have trouble with the amount are feeding their pets food that isn't the right size for this machine.)If your cat is smart, as is mine, he will eventually figure out how to stick his paw in and draw out a few pieces of food. Rest assured, this doesn't cause overeating; they can only access the few pieces at the bottom of the auger. So let them. They can also wiggle the machine to shake those pieces out - I solved that by affixing mine to the floor.My only complaint is that the nozzle that covers the opening is an unreliable plastic. Granted, it had a 12-pound cat pawing at it; but mine broke completely within 10 months. The plastic funnel - it's been redesigned since the picture on this site-- broke completely from left to right. Since I was past the 6 month mark, the seller did not have any obligation to fix the product (although under warranty) - nor did they even have the courtesy of responding to my email. Amazon responded, but did nothing to resolve the issue. Luckily, the manufacturer was more responsive.All things considered, I think this product has some design flaws - shouldn't it be built to withstand a curious cat? - but I would buy it again for the security it's given me over the past year.",cats,2

She's been wearing the authentic Soft Paws from softpaws.com since I adopted her as a 1 year old. I have never had to have anyone hold her down to put the covers on. She's so laid back she's practically horizontal. Let me tell you, these covers from Amazon are NOT the same thing! Yes they have the CLS design, but the oblong shape to them as opposed to the actual curved claw shape of the authentic Soft Paws makes these covers extremely difficult to put on. I ordered one batch of Amazon covers and I just started using them. I went to replace 2 covers tonight and again got glue all over myself. I was trying to hold the opening to the claw cover open enough to slip it on her claw but she cried cause it wouldn't go on easy. Then the cover fell off and got stuck to her hair. I had to cut it out! Amazon does not give a very good view of the covers before purchase. It would be very easy to mistake them for the same shape as the more authentic covers. The price is attractive, but that's where it stops. They are not worth it. Save your money and order the REAL deal.",cats,2
"This lead is perfect for taking my dog to the beach, it gives her enough freedom to run around yet allows me to keep her from running into the road after the joggers/bikers. This is definitely not meant to keep your dog tied up in the yard, not that you should anyway, but I could see a dog quickly chewing through it and getting tangled up! Just be careful, if your dog pulls too hard it cab give you a major burn!",dogs,3
I purchased this gate thinking my really young kittens wouldn't get over it so easily to get them use to the new house though of course being kittens this simple gate won't stop from going over. So of course this gate didn't really serve the purpose I had in mind for it. Though with that being said I still think this gate is a great gate for animal owners as it really is a sturdy gate that isn't easily going to be toppled over with a nudge or light push. If you own a dog and cat this will give the cat easy access to all rooms in the house while making sure the dog doesn't go into other areas or as well as keeping young babies/small children from accessing parts of the house as well.The door latch is really easy to use and with plenty of &#34;walk-Thru&#34; room to go through the gate and close behind you with an easy snap. This is a really good gate to have and HIGHLY recommend it for those that have a need for a gate in their house.,dogs,3
"These are the worst crates I have ever owned. I bought 6 of these crates for home and travel (I have shown and owned dogs for 15+years). These crates are flimsy, the tabs ment to hold them together slip- two of these have collapsed with my dogs inside of them. I do love the size of these crates (more of a square than rectangle)but now have just zip tied them together to remain stationary. The clips that hold them together when they are folded bend and warp and get caught on everything. I will never stray again from precision.",dogs,3

The PetSafe Wireless Fence system is just fantastic!! I purchased the system 30 months ago and my dog never crossed the border! It is perfect. Recently my son moved in with a LARGE dog and I purchased the extra collar/receiver. One time around my lot and he knew where to stay. He hasn't once crossed the border either. This system is SOOOOOO much cheaper than installing a fence!!!! I find it truly trust-worthy! Naturally it doesn't keep other animals out of your yard - but definitely keeps your dog or dogs where they belong.,dogs,3
"After purchasing this product locally for many years I recently found the price to have sky rocketed.

"Nice door for indoor use. The small size is larger than several other brands we looked at, with the U-shaped door providing more space than half-circle styles. I appreciate the 4-way lock. It doesn't seal well, so I wouldn't use it as a single flap on an outside door. We use two of them, one on a small cat house in the yard constructed over a basement window and the second through that basement window, forming a kind of airlock between the outdoors and our basement.",cats,2
"I have four cats and I've found this to be a great product. It clumps much better than any of the clay litters and I feel much better about using this not toxic product. Plus you can flush it, rather than having to put the pet waste in a bag and then take it out to the garbage can. With clay litter, you get a big cloud of dust every time you add more litter, but not with this product. It is expensive, but as long as we scoop it frequently, the 34 pound bag will last nearly a month for four cats. My cats love World's Best Litter and so do I!",cats,2
"I buy a lot of things at Amazon, but rarely write reviews. I had to do this one because I'm still shocked after the Fedex guy rang my doorbell a few minutes ago.I ordered this product about ten days ago and my kitty absolutely loved it from the start. She absolutely went nuts jumping over it, rolling around in it, treating it like a trampoline. It held up well. It was open for a couple of days. The [problem started when we tried to fold it.It just would not fold the way it was demonstrated in the video (find it on the Wild Whiskers website or look for ""Feline Funhouse"" on Youtube).THe frame was bent in one section. It could have happened because I applied too much pressure while trying to fold it.On Day 3 I contacted them by phone and left a message. Catharine called me back within a few hours and requested me to send in pics demonstrating the problem. This was last Friday. Saturday morning I sent in the pics. Monday morning (yesterday), she sent me an e-mail saying a new one was on the way by Fedex. This morning it was at my door. The defective one is fine when it's open. It just won't fold properly. So it will be donated to the local cat shelter.Lessons learnt:1. When you try to fold it and make it into a taco shape, pull the end further from you DIAGONALLY DOWN towards the floor.2. DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE. If you try it and it does not fold, keep trying, but DO NOT press on the frame 'cos it will bend and then it may not fold.3. WIld Whiskers has the best customer service I've experienced in my life.",dogs,3

"We have two dogs. Both pullers.Dog # 1 is a 12 lb. two year old French Poodle named Ruffles. Despite his small size, he would pull and resist commands while walking and when other dogs were around, he would bark and get very emotional on leash.Enter the Gentle leader...I carefully viewed the instructional video and used some tasty bits of meat to entice Ruffles to be still and sit as I applied the device (which is very easy and quick) When I was comfortable that the fit was correct, I attached his leash and was amazed that he was not pulling me as we walked to the front door.He rubbed at the Leader a few times with his paws a few times but by the time we were a half block away from the house, he was walking without any head shaking or nose rubbing. We had a pleasant walk and came back home to relax (wearing the Leader) as we fit our brother Marley with his Gentle leader.As I write this review, Ruffles is snoozing away wearing his Leader and seems very comfortable and content wearing it (and with more than a few juicy bites of roast beef in his little tummy!)Now for Marley, our 35 lb., 8 month old Black lab-Australian Shepherd puppy. Marley is the ultimate puller! He can pull me so hard that I can hardly keep up with him, all the while practically choking himself on his standard leash and collar! He also had a habit of 'mouthing' alot. I dreaded walking him - until now. Here's why...Placing Marley's Gentle Leader was also simple as I used the meat treats and encouraged him to sit as my feet facing away from me as I slipped the loop over his nose, tightened it a little and quickly applied the neck snap. Adjusting for a good fit took a minute or two and consisted of a treat and an adjustment alternatively until I felt his Leader was properly placed.I will say Marley was a bit perplexed after it was in place and he shook his head and pawed at it, but once we started walking he was fine. He rubbed his nose into the grass and the Leader did not rotate or move from how I placed it. A couple more treats and words of praise worked wonders and once we were about 5 houses away from the front door, he was walking with only a few head shakes here and there. The miracle was he did not pull at all. As I guided him to cross the street, he was at my side and at no time did he step ahead of me. This was truly amazing. When we came back into the house after our walk, there was no 'mouthing' which is an added bonus.I love this product. I am now typing away and I have two dogs sleeping at my feet-both wearing their Gentle Leaders!The most important thing you can do is watch the instructional video, use treats and make sure the device fits properly - then have fun on the most memorable and amazing walk you have ever had with your special pup!",dogs,3
"I bought this filter based on the reviews to replace the horrible tetra filter that came with my 1 gallon betta tank. After installation, I noticed there was a fairly powerful current in my tank, which my lazy betta fish did not appreciate.There is an adjustment knob on the side of the filter, which, when set to the minimum, was still a little too powerful for my tank. To fix this, I took a piece of filter material I had lying around from my other tank, and wrapped it around the exit nozzle. This helped slow the exiting water and reduced the current.Though this filter is advertised for tanks up to 3 gallons, I would not recommend it for anything smaller than 1.5-2 gallons.",fish aquatic pets,4
I have used Bio Bags for years in my fish tanks and here lately they have changed the mesh pocket I suppose to save money but it does not last near as long as they used too.

"Nupro addresses joint and skin issues from the inside out. It's a wonderful supplement we use regularly, along with Solid Gold's Sea Meal. It helps keep our dogs looking their best, for the many shows and events we attend. Their coats are shiny and healthier, which is the main reason we use it. My dogs are picky eaters. They will not readily take a powdered supplement, but I have found that Nupro is different. It is liver-flavored, and that makes a HUGE difference, at least from the dog's standpoint. My dogs don't like this in a wet or gravy form, so I have found that by adding just enough water (one or two tbsps), and stirring well, the powder will coat and stick to their kibble. When I do this, they readily gobble it down. Note",dogs,3

He'll sit there for a long time holding it conveniently and tearing chunk after chunk off. After all, the mark of a good parrot toy is that it is destructible and the more the mess the better. Our cockatiel loves them too, but they do last a bit longer for her. Highly recommend for other birds.",birds,0
"I held off reviewing this item until it was thoroughly tested by our cat. We've had it a little over two months now. I have to say, I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested. The crystal litter is amazing at controlling and nearly eliminating any odor. I added an odor eliminating air freshener just outside the room where we keep the litter box to ensure no odor escapes, but it is hardly needed. We have one cat that uses this litter box. We clean out the waste trap usually every four or five days and then we kinda shake the litter around in the box to disperse the unused crystal litter. One tray for our cat lasts a full month. The refills are a little pricey, but when you think of the convenience of not scooping daily (and the odor control) it is well worth the money. The litter box functions well, the rake has not jammed at all. The timer can be adjusted, but we leave it set to twenty minutes so the waste doesn't stick to the rake.If you have been thinking about ordering a self cleaning cat box for a while, this one is well worth the cost. I can't believe we waited as long as we did to get one. Highly recommended!",cats,2

"I have been giving Free & Clear to my Maltese for the past year. My vet recommended it after he found oxalate crystals and her urine. We tried various things to combat the crystal formation over a period of 4 months and nothing worked. In fact, when trying to change her ph from acidic to alkaline in order to avoid the crystals, she developed struvite crystals. Then he told me that another patient of his, a golden retriever, uses free & clear and asked if I wanted to try it. After 2 weeks, she was completely clear of all crystals and hasn't had any in over a year. I also give it to my other 2 dogs, my malshi and my shih Tzu rescue who have a tendency to develop struvite crystals and it works on them as well. I highly recommend this product.",cats,2
"My dog was doing fine at first and would eat all his food when I set it down. I had used a football shaped dispenser before and he did really good. I don't think he likes the orange ball as much because, yes it is a lot of work and I think he gets discouraged or bored after 20 minutes. He doesn't even bother getting all the food out, he just gives up. Especially when there are a few 4-5 pieces inside that I can't even get out easily he just leaves it there. Sometimes he will practically leave half his food in there. He began letting the ball just sit there and lingering over it. Now he just walks away from his food after one bite. I think he is disinterested in the ball, maybe my dog is lazy. But then I tried walking him then setting his food in the food bowl and he still did the same thing, he didn't eat it up like he used to. So I don't know if the ball made him take a step back in learning/training or if he's just not interested in food anymore. But the ball definitely made him start to just let the food sit there and I think it's because he thinks the food will be there whenever he wants it so he's gonna eat it when he feels like it not when I say he should be eating. I don't think that behavior is right and he used to always eat when I said it was time to eat.",dogs,3

"When we adopted two small shih-tzu puppies, we went to our local pet store and sampled a variety of puppy and adult canned foods. The biggest difference in puppy diets is that they are higher in fats and calories for high-energy fast growing puppies. Our puppies are not picky at all, so it wasn't like there was one they hated, but what we liked about this food was that had identifiable food chunks in it - duck, carrots, peas, etc, it wasn't too smelly, they have good solid poops with it, and they are growing quickly / happily on it! They've been eating it for three months now with no major issues, so it is our go-to food until they hit 1. We like it so much that I bought some of the adult food for our senior dog, and he is doing great on it - he has sensitive stomach issues, so not all canned or dried food digests well for him, but we've had no issues with this brand for him (Senior Plate, Turduckhen, Thanksgiving plate, etc).",dogs,3

"I have an almost 3 year old Saint Bernard that has chronic, disgusting skin issues. He does pulse rounds of antibiotics for chronic infections, has severe allergies, and even the dermatologist has issues getting him regulated. I had noticed that he was chewing on his back again and licking his front legs, and had called in a refill of antibiotics to preemptively start so it wouldn't become a raging infection again, but had also recently purchased these. I figured no time like the present since his skin was gross anyway. After 2 days on these, I didn't need the antibiotics. His coat is healthy, he's about 80% less itchy, and the staining on his skin where he licks is slowly disappearing. I could not be happier with this product. Even better, it hasn't upset his already sensitive stomach. Definitely something I am going to keep him on! He's been on it a month, and there are no regrets!",cats,2

My fiance brought his dog to our home with warnings of ""She broke a Dyson vaccum, we have to vacuum daily, she sheds like crazy, there is ALWAYS hair someWHERE...""This dog is an 80lb Shepherd mix and his shedding warnings were an understatement! After a year of Zoom Grooming, hours of brushing, frightening baths, and DAYS of vacuuming the back seat of my car even after it's covered with a thick cotton rug--this little tool has ended my anguish and anxiety. *Sigh of Relief*Hair drippage has been reduced DRAMATICALLY after 1 hour of serious work with it, followed by daily Furminating. She is sleek, shiny, and not shedding! Granted there is some hair here and there but not globs of hair bushes sprinkled about the house. I get emotional just thinking about the cleaning freedom! The poor dog was distressed even by the zoom groom but she is pleasantly surprised by the Furminator. She doesn't flinch when we use it and she has expressed no discomfort at all! She is squeamish about all things related to grooming and would run even from the very gentle Zoom Groom!The only downside--and I mean this is minute--is that the Furminator will find a LOT of hair and you need to be prepared with an adequate receptacle.

"I have to be honest here. I just got this water fountain yesterday, but my first impressions are very favorable. It was a breeze to put together. That maybe because I had another pet fountain, and although it was a completely different make and design, it was based on the same idea. The instructions however were quite simple to follow. I do feel I need to point out something that i discovered accidently. After I had put the unit together, as instructed, filled it with water and turned it on. I was initially disappointed because it was making a rather annoying gurgling noise. However, when I disassembled and reassembled the parts around the water pump I discovered that one of the top parts that fits onto the water pumps outlet nozzle just hadn't quite set right, but when it WAS in place correctly the noise disappeared, and I mean DISAPPEARED! This thing is asolutely dead ""turnded off"" silent when it's running. like I said at the beginning of this review, this unit is brand new to me, so only time and proper maintenance will determine it' true worth, but for now I think it's great.",cats,2

I looked and found this one and thought it would work in my cage from ProSelect. It does fit and is very well made but my cats (size 8 and 14 pounds) are just too big for it. I cut the clips and elastic off and they lay on it in their bed.,bunny rabbit central,1
"I have both real and fake plants in the tank. The real plants are beneficial in absorbing nitrates, phosphates, and controling algae growth, but if you have a tank full of real plants you would have to add fertilizer, special substrate, co2 injection etc. Having fake plants in the background and a few real plants in the mid and foreground means less plant maintainance.",fish aquatic pets,4

"This has been a great buy. The plastic ""walls"" do not seem cheap at all, they are well molded and sturdy. I just wish I bought the taller version because my puppy is growing fast and is going to outgrow this shortly. I am hoping that we can have him trained to a point where he will know it's his spot and not try to jump out. This serves currently as our timeout/sleep area during the day in our living room, and he (an American Bulldog) is crate trained at night. I love that it's open and he is still involved in our lives and can see what's going on, and we know just where he is at all times.

The holes for the bolts on panel B are too big, so there's no way to attach that side. Not even bothering with an exchange.

"I have two cats and an automatic food dispenser. I have it set to dispense 1/4 cup at a time so that one of my cats cannot eat until he pukes. Unfortunately, my dispenser only allows me to dispense food 3 times a day. While the food they eat is dense and high quality, the fact is that 3/4 of a cup of food distributed between two sedentary house cats isn't quite enough. I had taken to manually giving them a couple small ""snacks"" during the day, but then they began to beg me for food.With this toy, I can load the ball with 1/4 cup of food and leave it out for them at night. They push it all over and nibble whenever the mood strikes them. They seem to find it entertaining. They no longer pester me for food at odd times. This was a great way to solve a slight underfeeding problem. It allowed me to give them a controlled portion of food AND a little game to play at the same time. They actually eat less than they would if I just put 1/4 cup of food into their bowl. It seems to fill some need inside them to ""stalk"" their food and then eat it. Even when they eat out of boredom, they eat a lot less because they have to work for it.",cats,2

"If your pet engages in, er, ""inappropriate elimination,"" normal cleaners don't do the trick to get the smell out. This stuff works pretty well, although it seems to take a few days for the smell to really fade. I believe there are other similar products that may work just as well, but I liked this one because I was able to purchase it for a good price ... and I got a handheld UV light at the same time. I got a kick out of crawling around the house like Grissom from CSI, looking for all the cat pee. Of course, the thrill of that activity wears thin after a while.",cats,2

I also stay away from activated charcoal because it just pulls it all back out. Be careful though for the occasional algae blooms.

He suffered from some stomach problems when he was a puppy so I switched him to Innova. I loved Innova, but my puppy didn't - his hair became oily, he didn't seem interested in the food, he began to smell bad, and the stomach issues continued. I did more research, switched to Wellness, and everything cleared up! I like the clean ingredients, the way his coat looks, and how he NEVER has bad breath or puppy farts. Ever.",dogs,3

"This is one of the most useful things I have bought for my dogs and my car. Not only are the dogs kept contained and safe, but my seats won't get scratched, dog hair doesn't get all over the car, and they can't smudge up the windows. It fits just right across the back seat and straps in place. I didn't buy the optional pads that fit it, but you don't really need them because the material is strong enough to protect your seats. If you want to though, you can just throw an old blanket in there for your dog(s) to lay on. I have a pug and a boston terrier and there is more than enough room in there for the both of them. It folds down flat and zips shut so when you don't need it, you can collapse it down and store it in your trunk and it won't take up any room at all. As the other reviewer wrote, the mesh sides ARE a little dark, but they are breathable and do not cause any problem at all for me or my dogs. I'd recommend this product to anyone who asks, it will really save your car.",dogs,3

"Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do. My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy. Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life. After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian. Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications. I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy. His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight. I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after. To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results. If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would be almost nothing.",dogs,3

"I may get down voted for the first mediocre review, but hopefully my outcome is atypical to the normal user experience. I felt I had to share my experience.As a background. I found some week old kittens about 9 days ago. Their mom, I found out later, was eaten by a fox. They were underweight and cold when I found them (four of them).I ended up nursing them all back to health on a competitor's kitten food. They get very healthy, and were growing fast. I then ordered this on Amazon because it was ten dollars at the time, which was cheaper than the stuff I had gotten at the store here.Well, the good news is, the cats loved the taste. They dove right in and ate a lot. The bad news...every single one of them over the past two days has gotten the explosive poops. It started with just one of them, so I thought he was sick, but all of them started getting wet poop eventually, with the larger kittens getting it later.Wet poops aren't even the problem, but they keep soiling themselves inside their crib. I don't know if it's because when they crawl it stimulates their BM reflex, or if their small anus' can't keep in the vegetable oil that's in the product. At any rate, I've gone through a lot of sheets. They aren't ready to litter train yet, so I'm kind of in s stuck position.I may be able to chalk this up to a bad batch, but I would definitely be wary about giving this to kittens that are already healthy on something else. I am going out right after this review to purchase the old stuff I had them on, as I am tired of spending hours a day cleaning off caked poop off of my kittens. Being a mama cat is no fun in that regard.Hope this helps, and I pray no one else has had this problem.EDIT 5/19/2012The kittens are three and a half weeks old now. After switching them back to the other formula and using kaopectate, I was able to calm down all their angry innards. After research, I found out it is sometimes dangerous to change a kitten's diet suddenly like that. I am starting to acclamate them to the new formula, slowly mixing more and more into their current brand.So, this was partially my fault. But, I also noticed this stuff is a lot thicker than the other formula I use, making it harder for the kittens to suckle efficiently. They sometimes get visually frustrated with that.08/06/2012Final update. I was right, a couple people didn't appreciate the review. But that's alright, I stand by it. The kittens did a lot better on the Wal-Mart brand of formula. I even tried the KMR second step stuff, and that did even worse. I ended up buying some micro pellets of dry food, and they took to that instantly after two weeks of trying to get them to eat the KMR stuff (this was a couple months ago).Since then, I'm proud to update all of the kittens that were alive as of the last update are now in great homes. I still think this brand, for whatever reason, almost killed off my entire litter. Try cleaning up caked on kitten poop for a week. I spent many hours with a warm bowl of water and a tooth brush.So, if it works for you, great. But I would still suggest not switching to this if you have them healthy on something else. For me, it was a very bad experience. Whether or not it works better if you start them on this...that is to be decided (when I found the starved little kitties, I didn't have the luxury to wait on Amazon, even with prime delivery).",cats,2
"I had bought one of these Harnesses for my Pug and it worked very well. So I bought 2 more for my other 2 Doggies. It makes it much safer to walk and train them than a standard Harness. It pulls their front shoulders together should they get ahead of you so they tend to back off and stay at your side where they belong. The choker style collar is the worst. For a Pug especially, it can cause the eyes to pop out of the socket. So I would suggest this collar for all types of dogs. Amazon was the best deal. I bought 2 store returns here for $10 less than the original one I bought at P---s---t.Ron",dogs,3

"I really think this is a great thing -- wish I'd gotten it long ago. For younger cats, it's perfect. I only pay attention to the sand box every other week, and even then don't have to touch anything really dirty. However, for my old, sickly cat, it's less useful because the cat already has very messy toilet habits, which means taking time to clean up all the outside surfaces of the contraption because the cat misses the box a lot. For him, it's easier to have a regular sandbox made from a cardboard box that I can completely throw out every few weeks. SO now I have both.",cats,2

We have had great success with this product. The secret for carpet is to apply liberally (with a watering can or a manual pressure sprayer) and then cover with plastic for a week or two.

"It's loud enough and the button makes it much easier to use than the clickers I've used in the past. Plus it fits nicely in the palm of my hand, though I did add a wrist strap to make it even more user friendly.Aside from not coming with a wrist strap (and hey, at that price I wouldn't really complain) the only problem is it occasionally gets stuck in the pressed-in position and won't out-click. This problem is solved easily enough by pressing through the opening under the button to de-press the clicker. To do this you need some sort of slender, pointy object like a screwdriver or a knife. After that it works like a charm again.",dogs,3

"This is my third Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed, my puppy has the small, medium, and large, and each one is perfect for her. She's only had one accident which wasn't a problem because the bed is washable. Keep in mind that regardless of the size it is better to wash by itself and on a delicate cycle. For drying I also dried it on a delicate cycle, which took a little longer, but I didn't want to take a chance of ruining the pet bed.I have all 3 Pet beds one on top of the other in her crate, however when she goes into another room I remove the top bed for her to lay on. She's going to be a large dog so placing all three beds in her crate is perfect give as she grows and gives her a little extra cushion all around and as she gets bigger. Once that happens I'll just remove one pet bed at a time until she too big for multiple pet bed layers; then she'll just have another blanket to go with her bed.Overall, I would definately recommend this ped bed, regardless of your puppy or dogs size; I'm sure they will appreciate it, my puppy does.",dogs,3

"Seriously... Max is overweight, lazy, and when he walks he looks like he'd rather be sleeping. The only thing that gets him up is a desire to eat, a need to relieve himself (sorry for the graphics), or the sound of a squirrel at the door (seldom happens). Today the ""SlimCat"" arrived, I filled it with kibble, said ""Yeah, right!"" to myself, and set it on the floor. I put one piece of kibble near it and set the ball rolling. The smell of the food got him rocking and rolling, literally. ALL KIDDING ASIDE, he loved it... he spent a half hour kicking it around and eating the diet goodies as they fell out. Now I figure once a day when I leave for work I'll fill it with 1/4 cup of food and Max will be shaking his groove thang again.

So...when you have a BIG cat the urine makes a goopy paste that simply sticks to the combs making a big clump of ""you know what"" rather than going into the receptical. Speaking of which...I was cleaning my litter box once a day. Now? Once a day...scraping poop off the comb, getting my HANDS RIGHT IN THE LITTER as I empty the receptical that is covered with litter and other goodies. Changing grocery bags and PUSH PUSH PUSHING them down testing and retesting the machine...otherwise the door won't go down and kitty will go elsewhere...which HAS HAPPENED.

It's a wheat/corn product with a little bit of bacon and cheese far down on the ingredient list. There was a time when most of the dog treat products were of this low caliber. Today there are far better choices with more wholesome ingredients and even real meat listed first.Beggin Treats are soft and easy to break into small pieces. Our dogs do seem to enjoy this offering, but in the world of dog snacks, this one resides near the bottom of my list, a treat I wouldn't consider no matter the price.",dogs,3

I used this heater for about 2 years with a 50 gallon reef tank. After 2 years it developed an internal leak which shorted out the heating coils and tripped my ground fault circuits. In addition to shorting the coils a small amount of water was leaking from the temperature adjustment knob. Because this is the only in-line heater I have found I purchased a second unit to replace the first one. After 2 months it also developed an internal leak and shorted the heating coils. I am now using an in-tank heater.If anyone knows of a good inline heater to use instead of this one please let me know.,fish aquatic pets,4
"I have a vacuum designed especially for homes with pets, and for PET hair, it does pretty well. For HUMAN hair, it has a much harder time and despite cleaning the roller after each vacuuming session, I've had to replace the roller and the belt three times. My hair is almost down to my waist and my stepdaughter can sit on her hair and we both shed a LOT of hair. I think we shed more than the cats, actually.I was looking for something that would get up as much hair as possible off the carpet prior to vacuuming it, read the reviews, and ordered The Universal Rug Rake. I haven't had any problems with the height of the handle (I'm 5'7"") and the handle hasn't collapsed on me during use, although I do tighten it before each use so maybe that's why. Using short, quick strokes and working in a grid pattern, it is both impressive and a little scary how much hair this thing gets up. We did a 3x3 section of carpet in the hallway outside the bathroom - we had to clean out the rake twice. I didn't realize how much hair was left behind after vacuuming. I also noticed that it did a very nice job of fluffing up the carpet, and it's made getting some of the deep down dirt that gets imbedded into the lowest part of the carpet fibers much easier to get up. The rug rake has been great for getting up all the junk that clogs my vacuum, and I use it daily to keep the carpets looking fresh. It's made vacuuming quicker and more efficient, because I'm no longer stopping to clean the roller, and there's no more burnt hair smell lingering in the air after I'm done. (gross, I know)All in all, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and have already recommended this product to friends.",dogs,3

can't say if this product exclusively healed my dog's wounds but it definitely helped...she was on meds and wearing a 'comfy collar' that also contributed to healing however this shampoo is so far my favorite...it's a medicated shampoo so it doesn't necessarily smell like fruit or flowers but it gave her a clean smell and made her fur super soft..plan on buying this again when we run out.,cats,2

The sturdy nylon and round profile keep it looking good through many scratching and grooming sessions. Only one of my cats has ever broken one -- she caught it on a tree branch and it broke away, as expected, and I fount it hanging there the next day. It's wonderful for long-haired cats, since it doesn't mat the fur. The best part is, it fits kittens at about 8 weeks of age. For the price, you can't beat this collar.",cats,2

"I have two dogs that shed a ton! Our akita/chow mix seems to have an endless amount of fur that I battle with year-round. We've actually gone through two vacuums cleaning up after her. Before the Furminator, I used a undercoat rake, a top coat brush, and my hands to deal with her hair; only to find that there would be just as much the next day. Now I can just use the Furminator and it does better than my three ""tools"" put together! The thing I love most is that it is able to get all her little leg hairs, which contribute a ridiculous amount to her shedding and I was only able to use my hands for it previously. It also works wonders on my black lab/blue heeler mix. I had recently brushed, bathed, and brushed him, then I used the Furminator and could not believe how much hair it removed! Plus, it makes their coats look clean, shiny, healthy, and beautiful! It has helped my lab's dry skin condition too. I am a believer and would recommend the Furminator to anyone with pets that shed.",cats,2

"Works great. I've been purchasing them through Amazon for around 6 months now.

I run my filter with two in at a time, rotating which one I switch every two or three weeks as needed.

I figured out that he really likes movement to his water. When I slowly stirred the water in his old dish, he would drink it. This gives me days of peace until it needs to be cleaned. I use distilled water so that it won't breakdown with minerals, but I have to remember to always have some on hand.",cats,2

If you have a cat who is always getting into things and trying to figure out the world, they will probably like this little puzzle toy. I ended up buying a few extra balls for it.

"This doesn't look like the exact collar I have (mine has a metal adjustment mechanism) but in general I can't recommend martingale collars highly enough. My dog walks very nicely on the leash but is sometimes fearful, so I wanted to keep her from slipping out of her collar in a scary situation without risking a correction that would be too harsh for her by using a choke or pinch collar. The collar is loose and comfortable as long as the dog isn't pulling, and when they do pull it tightens up enough to hold the head firmly in the collar but (if you've adjusted it correctly) not enough to choke them. When the dog stops pulling, the collar loosens immediately.I have also seen this used on dogs with sensitive skin who are irritated by choke and pinch collars.I bought my collar for an obedience class that required a ""training"" collar and was unsure whether this qualified. For anyone who's here for the same reason",dogs,3

"I've used these for several months now and so I think I have a good feel for the product. It's worked out well for our cat and our household. First thing you need is a cat who is reasonably comfortable being handled and, particularly having her paws handled. My cat is in this category, and yet my wife has to help me by scratching and petting the cat to keep her calm and cooperative during installation.You snip off the sharp tips of each claw. This is an essential step. They don't fit right if you don't do this. Then you pre-load the number of Soft Claws you need with superglue (supplied.) Gotta fill them about half-way, and it's rather hard to tell how much glue you've put it them. This is a bit tricky, because these things are small, and I typically get a bit of superglue on my fingers in the process. Once this step is done, you simply hold the Soft Claw, sort of pinching it open, and just slide it on. (You gotta do that thing where you squeeze the paw to make the claw stick out. Superglue is fast-acting, of course, so you only have to keep the cat calm for a minute or 2 after application.At first, I noted my cat was shedding these things pretty fast. I thought they lasted a week or 2 rather than the promised 4-6 weeks. But, I also noted she was working to pull them off with her teeth. (The cat, not my wife.) After the first 2 or 3 weeks, the cat got used to the product and stopped trying to remove them, and now they clearly do last considerably longer. But, you have to check the cat from time to time and, typically, when I notice she's missing 2 or 3, I reapply from the supply of, what?, 40 in each set.These come in clear, but I strongly prefer the bright colors, because it makes it easier to see when they are missing. (Also easy to spot the discarded ones on the floor.)",cats,2

"This is my first review so please bare with me. I felt compelled to write this review because of all of the positive feedback which ultimately influenced my decision to purchase this kennel. Well, the feedback coupled with the discount price...We have 2 dogs, one which is a bulldog puppy and the other is an adult boston terrier (very small). We wanted to get a second kennel so both dogs would be in a similar size kennel since the adult is already well trained.Much to our dismay, this kennel seemed pale in comparison to our existing kennel which was purchased a year or two ago from a local national pet store for just a few dollars extra.The metal wire on this kennel seemed to be far less thick which meant it was completely unsuitable for the bulldog puppy. It is about the same thickness of a wire hanger which black enamel paint on it.Really, the worst part was the hard plastic liner tray made it unlivable for the smaller dog since it seemed to magnify even the slightest movement on it. For example, we would hear TAP TAP TAP all night long as the boston terrier moved during her sleep. It was so loud that we could hear it throughout our house.Additionally, the liner has a rough texture to it. I assume its to prevent a puppy from sliding around since they do not tend to have rough paws. But with a small mature dog, it was absolutely impossible to listen to the scratching on the surface all day and night.In contrast, our existing kennel had more of a rubbery plastic liner. The fact that it was more pliable meant that it absorbs most of the sound and either dog can move around in it without much noise at all. The rubbery texture also meant that it could be smooth while still providing some grip for the dog.So you are thinking, why not just put a kennel mat inside ?? Well we did, and the noise actually comes from the tray tapping against the bottom metal wire. To solve this problem, we want and purchased a roll of some padded shelf liner. The liner costs approximately $8. So when you add the cost of the liner plus the kennel plus the shipping, we could have gotten a quality kennel locally for the same price. Not to mention the sleep we lost trying to figure out how to solve the problem.Hope this helps.",dogs,3
"This kennel arrived within a few days which was great because my puppy had grown out of his small kennel. I thought the kennel was larger, so for the price it was actually higher than the pet store. My only complaint was that it didn't come with a food and water dish, which I thought came with ALL kennels. I had to go out and pay another $15.00 to get one. I would have returned the kennel but had to have a place for my puppy.",cats,2

I went online and found simple directions as to how to get it going again. Worked like a charm, and no problems since. I do take it apart once every few months for a check and cleaning if need be.My model (just like the one pictured on Amazon) does an amazing job of ""sucking up"" all the smaller bits of grass, hair, and gunk that get into the bowl on occasion.

The 13.5 cat tried to bust out of the carrier, making it necessary to secure the carrier with zip ties so that the carrier didn't come apart. I also covered the carrier handles with bicycle handle tape to make them more comfortable to carry. They are the perfect size for each of the cats. With the zip ties and handle bar tape, they are sturdy and ideal for transporting pets. They make trips to vet tolerable for me and the cats.",dogs,3

Also, I had to clean it several times a day (VERY picky cats).I got the bigger one and problem solved. Period. I'm sending the standard size one to my mom, she has 2 cats, and I think the box will be enough for them. As for 3 cats, it's asking too much for the standard one.I Had them sent to Chile. Veeeery expensive management of the box, the delivery, customs, etc, but entirely worthy. I don't have to scoop anymore, I hated that. Easy to clean, no need to touch anything but the container... great.",cats,2
The scooper works well once you get the hang of it. The bags are a little hard to get on so it takes some practice.,cats,2

"This product is perfect, and my cats love it. They even come in from OUTSIDE and use the litter box and then go out again. There's a stray cat around here that follows suit. They must like Ever Clean better than the grass outside.Ever Clean is easy to handle - easy to clean and pour into litter box. It clumps around the doo-doo and ""moisture deposits"" which makes clean up REALLY EASY. And, that sandy texture is so soft and nice on the hands that I have to run my hands through it right after I open the box. (I don't do this AFTER the cats have used it, of course).",cats,2
The Dogs smelled great and the coat was left shinny and soft it was easy to put on and take off,cats,2
"The 1.75 inch Furminator for toy breeds feels like it ""rips"" away at my Pomeranians fur. She is 7 pounds and fights me the whole time I use it. So I don't recommend it for this breed. She loves other tools used for de-shedding, and she will just lay in my lap so it's not the dog.",cats,2
"We have one grumpy older cat and a younger cat we got as a kitten (both indoor). The kitten has stayed in this every night for months without complaint. There is room for a litter box and bed still leaving an open space for a rug, food and water. This gives our older a cat a break from the younger one and keeps the younger one from waking us up at night. We do use an old plastic table cloth (water proof) under the entire enclosure for accidental spills and to catch the litter tracked out of the litter box. The mesh is strong and stands up to occasional clawing. The front flap opening is large enough to allow easy access to the litter box and can be kept in an open position by a velcro strap. The zipper is sturdy and with smooth movement.",dogs,3
"All-in-all, it's a great concept especially for apartment dwelling; however, it doesn't totally lock in the odor. I find that I need to also use doggie bags (& I don't even have a dog), & as another LitterLocker user suggested, drop in disinfectant wipes or spray for the clean up to be bearable. Altho every 2-week disposal is the ""required"" according to the box, I do week cleaning. I don't regret getting this product, yet I do think it can be improved to put truth to the ""Absolutely no more odor"" description. Are these bags biodegradable? Hmmmm....is it possible to do that with biodegradable products? Thank you for this opportunity.",cats,2
"I have used multiple types of litter boxes, and now have a new kitten in the house along with a 9yr old. The kitten took to it right away. The older cat has taken a little longer, due to the kitten using it and being used to her old one. Best thing about it was how easy it was to use, just roll it and dump it! I also use a litter locker to dump it into. It was so easy to use, I bought another one, and now both cats seem happy. Great investment for the money. I also have an automatic one, but they dont seem to use that one as much now, and the refill cartridges can be expensive. Only downside is one latch broke a few weeks after buying, but amazon replaced right away. Overall I would highly recommend this product!",cats,2
"My cat was tearing up our brand new chair and I was about to get rid of her, a friend suggested I try this product, I was skeptical, but I ordered and tried it. So glad I did, my cat no longer scratches on the chair, she won't even go near it now. I now can have a nice new chair and keep my cat.",cats,2
"We purchased our first size right harness at petco when we first got our dog almost four years ago (a 9 lb. yorkie mix). We weren't sure what size harness we would need exactly, so this adjustable harness appealed to us. We have had only positive experiences with this harness. Once you become familiar with how the harness adjusts and in the simplest terms, how it ""works"", this harness is awesome. It is adjusted to your dog's exact size and ends up snug but not too tight (we even have to make it a bit smaller when our dog gets his hair cut - that is how perfectly you can make it fit). If the harness is loose like the earlier commenter explained, then it needs to be adjusted or a smaller one should be purchased. We are on only our second harness in less than four years. Can't recommend this one enough. Petco hasn't carried this harness for years, so when I needed to purchase a replacement I found them here on amazon and the price is right!",dogs,3
This is a great product for getting rid of fleas. Have used several times on my German Shepherd and it works well.,dogs,3
"The cover does what it's supposed to do. It was delivered relatively quickly and was easy to install. We did air it out for a few hours, as it does have an odor. Once installed, the odor was no longer noticeable. Nice product, especially in the $25 range. I don't think I would spend too much more than that, only because it is, after all only a cloth cover.",dogs,3
This product works as well as can be expected for such an item. I don't believe there is any way to prevent all litter from being tracked out of the litter box by a cat. But I do see less litter on my carpet now.,cats,2
"This treat ball is probably not for every dog, but our 8 month old Shiba Inu puppy absolutely adores it and so do we. Our trainer recommended that we use a treat ball as a way to challenge our puppy and focus his energy on something ""productive"" (for him, at least). This does the trick better than any other similar product. It is very durable yet (unlike a Buster Cube) soft enough that nothing gets damaged as it rolls into walls, chairs and the like. We use it for half of his kibble at each meal. After about 4 weeks of daily use, our ball is starting to show signs of wear but we have gotten far more use out of this than any other ""toy"" we've purchased.Our puppy is a high energy, very food motivated, tough-chewing, smart little guy who can get treats out of his Kong and open the child gate in under 5 minutes. But while this treat ball requires patience, our normally ""A.D.D."" puppy will persistently push this ball around the kitchen until he gets every last piece of kibble out. That can take 20-30 minutes. The ball does not make a good ""chew toy"" for a tough chewer (like our dog, who can chew off the top of a red Kong), however. We make sure to take it away after he empties it. Otherwise, it would never have lasted this long.",dogs,3
"We have the Hide A Squirrel toy as well and this one is just as wonderful. My dog loves this toy and enjoys the challenge of pulling each bee out of the hive. I'll say this though, the bees don't seem as durable as the little squirrels that come with Hide A Squirrel but otherwise this toy did not disappoint!",dogs,3
"I bought this for my betta tank, but in pink and a little spikier petals, and it looks very nice! The flower part is right below the surface of the water in my tank, and bettas love to lay on and in things right at the surface, so I find him there in his flower constantly throughout the day resting. It's well made, I like the gravel bowl base a lot, and it's very easy to clean. The plastic isn't rough or hard, so it won't cut your fish's fins. Very happy with this product.",fish aquatic pets,4
I have used this for years and it has never worked. Also it has not worked for my vet. He has two dogs and it will last a little over two weeks. It last from one to two weeks for me allso. She is a inside dog. When I started to use this and it did not last I called Frontline and I was told to use a larger size.,dogs,3

"I can't recommend these simply because I feel that they might be a bit on the dangerous side. My cat loved the flavor of these, but had a problem with the size and choked up a single piece on more than one occasion. If you search on Greenies and choke you'll see that others have experienced this issue with Greenies. The best treats I've found are the All Natural Temptations, any flavor.",cats,2
"We have two cats and I hate cleaning the litter box three or four times every day. I bought this self-cleaning box and for the first few weeks let the cats get used to the larger box by using their regular litter in a box lid that just fit the unplugged self-cleaning box. Once they were using that, I started adding some of the special litter and finally switched over to the self-cleaning box and the special litter and they love it and I do too. It is important to let them get used to it and the new litter or they won't use it.",cats,2

"I ordered this thing and it's a piece of crap. I had it set to spray and alarm and when the motion detecter was set off, all it would do is beep incessently for 10 minutes until I had to finally shut it off to make it stop. Because it's classified as ""hazardous materials"" (yet pet safe????), I can't even return it. I'm out $50 between the unit and the refill cans. Not happy AT ALL!!!",cats,2
"Nothing's perfect, especially kitty litter. We've tried many different kinds including World's Best (which smelled really horrible), Sweatscoop, and pea pod varieties. Thankfully, our two cats are rather flexible and adapted very quickly to the Feline Pine pellets after we tried the scoopable version first and decided it tracked just as bad as the others (one of our main contentions with litter, the other being smell upon urination). These pellets really absorbs urine oder, but you do need to scoop out the solid waste a little more frequently since they have difficulty burying it. Tracking is very minimal. The fact that no strip mining (like for clay litter) and no offensive perfumes means that it's a little more environmentally friendly than many commercial litters. Biodegradability is also a bonus, though I can't speak for flushability since my apartment managers strictly forbid flushing litter of any kind.",cats,2
"This bottle is larger than you are ever going to need unless you are very unlucky with fish, turtles, and other things aquatic. It hasn't really solved our particular problem (turtle hatchlings with scraped up arm pits... long story) but it isn't really advertised for this particular purpose - it was recommended by a water turtle web site.Anyhoo... I suppose I should say &#34;I love it&#34; but how can you love a medicine that has been in use for weeks while one's little guys and gals get Slowly better and there's no way to tell how much it is contributing? Not an instant fix, not allowing things to get worse, maybe holding off infection while they heal in their own slow way... I'd buy more if there were more scrapes... Except this bottle will last forever. Sixteen ounces is a lot given how little one uses, and the price is therefor cheap.",fish aquatic pets,4
These filters are very easy to use and appear to keep the water fresh. The 3-pack is more economical. I am glad that it was available.,cats,2
"Until ""Da Bird"", her favorite toy was a springy pole with feathers at the end. It finally reached the point where the feathers were too few and I replaced it with Da Bird.My cat's attention span with her previous favorite was 5 minutes (other toys were less). Da Bird keeps her attention for at least 15 minutes. In fact, each time I have put it away she has made it clear she wants to continue. With other toys I had to bring the toy close to her body before she'd interact. Da Bird has her racing around the room chasing after it. Not bad for an overweight (but on a diet) 11 year old cat!I am thankful I got this one instead of the pole that disassembles. With the way she pulls on it, I think a 2-piece pole would likely come apart.",cats,2
"My dog recently had surgery to replace a torn ACL and does not like to be picked up and carried (Black Lab mix @ 50 lbs). To avoid having him kick out of my arms and undo what the surgery had fixed, I looked around and found this product. It has made carrying him up and down stairs so much easier as I can just carry him like a briefcase. The only complaint I have, which is geared more towards my dog, is that he sometimes steps out of the front straps and almost took a nasty spill as a result. Now, I just check the straps before I lift him.",dogs,3
"this product is great, if my cat liked it. he drinks from our bathroom sink so to get him out of there i bought this thinking it would mimic the sink. he was afraid of it. wouldn't go near it. i could here the water running in the fountain and it sounded like a faucet was on. once i got used to it, it didn't bother me. but i'll probably give it away because my cat won't drink from it.",cats,2
"I recieved this item in perfect shape. I recently added a 3 month shih tzu to our family and this is the greatest! My son had purchased the same, from a breeder, at $150.00, so this was an absolute bargin. The pen is extremely sturdy for a small breed dog. My puppy seems to hate confined spaces so a conventional crate was impossible to make use of. He loves the openess and yet has his own defined ""safe space"".I would highly recommend this product for anyone considering being away from your dog for a few hours...puppys can't eat you woodwork or kitchen cabinets or anything else while you are gon, because he is confined but still happy to have some room to play, eat and drink..",dogs,3
"My 20lb (at the time) terrier mix had to curl up VERY tightly to uncomfortably fit in it. He filled it up completely, but the website we ordered from (not amazon) charged a high restocking price so we gave it to my brother for his 15lb dog. She fits perfectly. She isn't able to stretch out and still has to curl up but for shorter car rides it works just fine. She definitely enjoys seeing everything go by from the window. Now at 25lbs, my own dog still likes to jump in it when he gets a chance. Having said that, the sides are not too sturdy if your dog leans on them and can tip the seat or fall out. It is also difficult to clean. Somehow, fur gets under the cover and since the seat is made of foam, it attracts fur and is hard to remove. The cover is also hard to get back on and after about one year of regular use (maybe once every two weeks), it has really worn down. It would be a good idea to use a blanket or some additional cover on top of the original cover. It is still a good car seat and the foam has held up pretty well. It really is overpriced, being that it is just a large piece of foam with a small drawer and cover on it; however, if the sides were sturdier and the seat were easier to clean I could give this 5 stars because the dogs do seem to enjoy it.",dogs,3
I love the smell of this stuff and use the shampoo and conditioner on my Afghan Hound. However the smell of the cologne just doesn't seem to last very long. I'm not sure if it even lasts a whole day. will continue to use it though and I'm going to keep track of how long it does last.,cats,2

"I have a seven month old puppy who was eating poop since she was seven weeks old. My vet told me about a product called Forbid. I read about Prozyme on line and I ordered it and my puppy no longer eats poop. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dog with a poop eating problem. Not only is the poop eating problem nasty, but it is not healthy. Prozyme really helped my puppy from getting into a really bad habit for her adult life. I know that I am a much happier dog owner now thanks to Prozyme!!!!!!",cats,2

"We rescued an 8 mo old Cavalier Spaniel with juvenile cataracts (she was scheduled for euthanasia); thinking we'd have the cataract surgery for her. An opth. specialist did not feel she was a good candidate, so we tried Ocluvet with his blessing (he did not recommend it, saying he couldn't advocate a medication that no double blind studies had been done). All of us thought ""it's worth a shot"". Four months of three times a day instillation later, the specialist rechecked her and was amazed. States, ""I won't endorse this product, but I will tell you that I could NOT visualize her optic nerve before, and now I can; use it once a day now, and call me if you notice the cloudiness worsening. Before it was as though she was looking through the bottom of a Coke bottle; now, it's akin to her looking through a spider-crack in the windshield. The cataracts are not gone, but they are fragmented."" From what I could see (and I am a nurse), the cloudiness, while not gone, is MUCH smaller. When we take pics of her, there is the redness of the flashback of the retina, which wasn't present on pics before using the Rx. The cost is worth the results we are seeing, so far. (and avoiding an invasive surgery that probably wouldn't work for her) We'd have to buy 20 bottles to equal the cost of surgery for one cataract, and she has one in each eye. It's worth a shot. Follow up with an opth. specialist to check the results for your pet. I'm elated, and the specialist is pleased with the results, although he won't attribute the improvement to the Rx. (The only other change we made was adding more betacarotene to her diet, carrots and sweet potato, daily)We will continue the drops and eye check ups.OcluVet Eye Drops 15ml",dogs,3
"First let me say that I bought my Panic Mouse at PetSmart not Amazon but it's the same toy. I'm giving Panic Mouse 3 stars because my cat would give it 5 stars for fun but I only give it 1 star for durability. The problem, which I discovered after taking it apart when it would no longer work properly, is that the internal mechanism is made of cheap plastic gears. If your cat does anything to really tug on the ""mouse"", the gears become damaged. I did buy a second one but this time I made the end of the wand attachment a little bigger so that it comes off when Diz tries to take his prize with him. He also only gets to use it if I'm busy around the house and don't have time to play with him with his favorite toy that costs about $3 to make. Get a 4 foot, 1/4 inch diameter wood dowel, thin black cord elastic and a cheap feather duster. Tie about a 5-6 foot length of the elastic around one end of the dowel and secure it with duct tape and then tape a few feathers to the other end. Since you have the whole duster to get feathers from you can replace them as needed without further cost. Life is short, play with your pets.",cats,2

"This product is plagued by breakdowns. The collar has broken 3 times in the first 6 months. First, the probes in the collar fell off. New collar, $56.00, long prongs, $9.95, overnight shipping, $15.00. Then our dog pulled the reciever off of the collar. New collar, $56.00, long prongs, $9.95, overnight shipping, $15.00. Then the cap on the battery came off. New cap, $9.95, new battery, $8.95, $15.95 for overnight shipping. If you have a long haired dog like I do, you have to buy the longer probes extra every time you replace the collar. The product was expensive enough to begin with without paying an extra $40-$50 dollars every time you turn around. I would try a different manufacturer next time, maybe invisa-fence. Even if it is more expensive up front, it would probably be cheaper in the long run.",dogs,3
"My dog got a pair of pink Doggles last winter after I realized the K9 Optix style wasn't going to fit her wide muzzle. At first she dragged her face on the pavement...then pawed at them...then gave in to the notion that if she pulled them off, I would put them back on. She likes to put her head out of the window (what dog doesn't?) on bye bye rides...the Doggles keep her from getting corneal abrasions from minute debris that flies through the air. This year, I got her a pair of the Chrome Doggles so they would match more items in her wardrobe. If you put the Doggles on a little bit at a time, the dog will get used to them.

"This is a great product with only one flaw. Sometimes it's difficult to find the edge of the plastic bag to pull it through and get the roll started. It would be great if the manufacturer could simply put a piece of colored tape onto the edge that the consumer could pull on to get the roll started properly. A couple of times I have had to pull out just about the entire roll in my attempt to find the edge to get it started. I would then have to stuff all of the plastic bag back into the container, which really hurt my fingers. If there were a colored tab to pull on to get it started, that would be perfect.UPDATE 06/20/09I have stopped buying this product because the price just keeps going up and up. I now use plastic grocery bags each day to scoop the waste into, tie the handles shut at the top, then toss the bag into my outside garbage container. The grocery bags are free, and they work just fine. I also had a problem with the litter locker itself the last few months that I used it -- it would not stay closed when I picked it up, so it would make a nasty mess when it fell open in the middle of my room. I don't know if the litter locker just wore out or not; I just knew I was not happy with its performance or the insane cost of the refills for it.

He doesnt chew it to destoy it, he chews it for fun and for comfort. Mainly he carries it around in his mouth all the time and chomps it. He seems to like the fact it is squishy. The only downfall is when he cant find it he searches and runs thru the house looking for it. haha.No toy is indestructable but these kongs last us approx 6mths until the constant chomping weakens the seams and they start falling apart.

We had this set on the highest setting for a week, (after the initial traing)since then it is set on the tone only, and he hasn't left the yard at all.

I have to say at first I was unsure about this product but was desperate for my beagle to stop barking all the time. I thought that she would still be a problem and that I would have to face the facts and give her away.I had tried a shock collar before but she learned to tolerate the pain and howl anyway. I bought the panel and it arrived next day and it was so easy to put together. It only takes a matter of minutes.. I was also unsure if the 4 panels would be big enough but her and our other dog have room to spare and love the play pen. They do not cry or complain at all I have not really had any problems with my beagle. She still barks when people come to the door and when we have thunder storms but other than that I would recommend this for anyone who has a dog that barks a lot and is trying to avoid shock collars.The only problems that I have had is that my dogs can move the pen it did not come with feet to hold it. And my Chion can jump out of it so for smaller dogs I would recommend the topper.Other than that this is a great product!

I have an average size yard, and it was about 30 feet short, so I had to go buy a whole extra roll from local pet store.",dogs,3
"I bought this having read the positive and negative reviews. After having used this for a month or so, I have to agree with the negative reviews. This gate is poorly designed. The pads that hold the gate in place do not pivot and my car's roof is not flat, so there is a gap between the gate's pad and the ceiling. This causes the gate to fall over, especially if the dog has been lying against the bottom of the gate. Also, installing the gate was a pain - not because it was difficult but because the screws holding the crossbars in place were difficult to access. Overall, I don't rate this very highly and I wish I'd paid more attention to my gut when it said not to go with this. Very disappointed.",dogs,3
Seems to work well when I went on vacation but I really cannot be sure. I will keep trying it. DOes not harm the fish at all.,fish aquatic pets,4
My two Birman cats found this item to be boring after sustained exposure. Would not recommend if your cats are in good health and like to be engaged in vigorous play.,cats,2
"I really like KONG products. Made for the chewing (or should I say, destructive) needs of the pup. He loves fetching his frisbee and chewing on it. But it's so flexible he can't damage it. And puppy size is appropriate for smaller dogs.",dogs,3
"Our Dog loves this toy. We were going to save it for Christmas, but was too excited. She plays with it for hours (as long as you keep re-stuffing it). The large size was perfect for our 20 pound dog!",dogs,3
I have a Havanese with a white face. This product does indeed work. I just mix it in with her wet food. You do have to use it continuously.,dogs,3
Coupler seemed very well made and sturdy but so much metal made it too heavy for my two ten pound dogs.,dogs,3
"My cats love it! It's quiet and easy to refill and clean.Just a warning, it comes with a USA outlet plug, so if you live outside of the USA you may have difficulty in connecting it to the power outlet.",cats,2
My new (older) kitten was not impressed. Maybe he doesn't like cat nip? He'll play with almost anything - even tissues - but does not play with this.,cats,2
"My parakeet is very picky and I was happy to get the food that was discontinued at our local store. However, the bag came with a hole in it and since the box had been mishandled as well (large hole in the box), some seed was missing. It would have been a very good idea to wrap the seed bag in another bag prior to shipping. Very bad packaging job.",birds,0
"This product worked just like advertised. However, it is only good for about 25 barks, which my dog used up in the first hour of wearing it. But it worked so well that all we have to do now is show him the collar to get him to stop barking. Now he smells lemony-fresh too, LOL.",dogs,3
"I was sent another non-printed cage cover. I was told I didn't have to return the red one...but never did receive the printed cage cover I ordered =( Don't think they have any in stock, but was never told one way or another.",birds,0
I have used this product for two months now and we still have fleas in fact I believe they are worse now then before I wasted the fifty dollars. I would have given it 0 stars if they would let me.,cats,2
"I have three cats and they love this water dish. There are often two cats drinking from the running water at any given time. Generally, the dish is easy to use, disassemble, and clean as often as you want to clean (my husband cleans it daily but it really isn't necessary (he just likes to do that for the cats)...my brother and sister in law have one that they claim they don't clean and it works fine)We have had three of these water dishes over the last 2 years. All of them failed due to pump problems. Finally I found out they sell pumps and went ahead and just bought a new pump. In the pump instructions they provided cleaning instructions for the pump (how to dissemble and clean w/ vinegar and water....this was not in our original instructions at the time). I managed to get all of our previous pumps working! So now I have a huge excess of pumps in case one ever goes out for any other reason.Some other tips",cats,2
"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for the strange can design -- a substantial amount of food sticks to the inside of the can and in the crevice under the top lip, long before the can is empty, and I have to use a baby food spatula to scrape this off.That being said, Cee Cee kitty devours this. It is not grain free -- as it does have Brown Rice in it (listed as the 8th ingredient, so it DOES have plenty of meat and fish protein), but the meat as well as the other ingredients more than make up for this. Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Formula with Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and Ocean Fish also smells very fresh and not garbagey like some of the supermarket cat foods. And since Cee Cee is battling hyperthryoidism as well as a heart murmur, I want to buy her the best food I can afford. This may be a bit pricey but it is VERY dense, so it goes a long way.",cats,2
"A year ago we rescued a Shetland Sheepdog who had been on her own for quite some time. Most of her fur was missing, she had large, deep scars on her face and horrible allergies. Within a couple of months on Vibrant Pets she looked like a new dog. Her fur was growing in like crazy, the allergies lessened and even her eyes were clearer. We have three Shelties and they take Vibrant Pets every day. One of our girls with a sensitive stomach doesn't have problems anymore. The money saved in vet bills is well worth the price of this product. In addition, the 48 oz container lasts us several months, even with three dogs having it twice per day.",dogs,3
"I was having such a problem with my 1-year old miniature pinschers enjoying the 24-hour buffet in the cats' litterboxes. I looked and looked for the old kind of hooded Booda boxes, but they don't exist anymore. I bought 2 of these and waited. Eureka! The dogs won't go up the ramp! The cats used the boxes the first day. Everyone is happy.",cats,2
"I have two italian greyhounds that are litter box trained. I like these better than other pads I have used and I feel like I have tried 2/3 of what is on the market, but the size is two small.I use an oversized portable canvas crate as their potty area but needed to use several to cover an area.Otherwise they were great. If I can not find any others that are bigger and work as well, I will use these again but just order more.",dogs,3
for $83 bucks after tax it should last longer than 2 years. Also battery time doesn't last that long (about a week for a heavy barking dog) batteries cost about $2 each,dogs,3
"My cat stopped using her box since late last summer. It's now almost May. We thought it was because of some crystallization found in her urine. We treated that with medicine from her doctor. She still went on the floor (right outside her box). I tried buying a new litterbox. I tried buying 2 boxes- one for her and one for her sister. I tried using a different kinds of litter (including World's Best and Feline Pine-which is awesome and I will eventually go back to). I tried using Feliway. Nothing ever changed. Eventually, I just gave up and bought puppy pads for the floor so it would be easier to clean up. I never thought that this stuff would work because the active ingredient is just ""natural herbs"", which to me translated to catnip and my cat couldn't care less about catnip.Finally, when I called the vet back to get a refill on her Prozac, a different doctor called back and suggested that I try this stuff. What the heck, right? I tried everything else. Originally, I just bought the additive and added it to the Feline Pine 'cause I just figured buying both their litter and the additive was a marketing ploy. She didn't respond to that, so I bought the actual Cat Attract litter and added the litter additive. She has used the litter box now ever since!!!I never write reviews. Even if I really love a product, I just forget. This stuff impressed me so much I had to let everyone know.",cats,2
Within two days my cat figured out how to pry the bottom trays out and pop the feeder open.I used contact cement to glue the trays down and put duct tape around the edges so no glue was showing.Now it works.,cats,2
"This is an economic solution to geriatric cats need for heat. Does not use much electricity, heats ageing joints and is small enough the cat can get away from in without leaving her bed when she is warm enough. She has learned how to turn it up, just stands there with two feet right in the middle and cries if it does not get warm immediately! We tell her just to wait and in a couple of minutes she is all curled up on the heating pad. As she warms she stretches out and ends up with just her paws getting warm still. She is a 21 year olde Siamese with a great love of life, but stiff joints.",dogs,3
This is a drinking fountain for cats. The cats seem to like and I hate writing reviews. Three more words,cats,2
The tips of the teeth are rounded and very gentle; my cat enjoys being combed with it. I was a shocked by the sheer number of fleas this comb extricated from my (seemingly healthy) cat!,cats,2
"My four cats seem to enjoy playing with this toy. I have added different types of balls,other small toys and catnip. It provides a night of fun for them and is sturdy enough to take some rough play by our 16 pound cat and our three petite females.It was worth the price and is not cheaply or poorly made like so many feline toys.",cats,2
"I have a cat who cannot get enough of a face or back rub. In fact, she has been known to wake me through the night to gather such attention. Thank God for the Kitty Korner Komber! I bought four of them and I have enjoyed uninterrupted sleep ever since! I placed on high on the wall where there is a perch on her cat tower. To be honest, I've used that one myself when I've had an itch I couldn't get to on my back. It does the job! There is one located on the corner wall leading into my room, one I placed on a different cat tower she has where she had torn some of the sisal rope and made it look like new again. The fourth one i placed on her favorite window and as she watches the birds, squirrels and other life outdoors she can brush her head and body around the frame of the window and massage her face and body. She seems to be very pleased with the variety of locations I placed them in and uses them regularly. I am pleased that she has chosen to use them and allow me the sleep I need at night, after all I'm not a cat and need a little more than a catnap to survive the day. I'm certain most cats will enjoy them as well. To add variety inside, sometimes I replace the catnip with honeysuckle that cats love as well. You might try it if your cat does not like catnip, I haven't met a cat that didn't adore honeysuckle!",cats,2
"This cage is amazing, and I love the mat that comes with it. I bought it for my two rats. One likes to climb out, and the other doesn't. I've been teaching the other not to climb out. Just advice for anyone looking for ways to play with your rats.Looks great for hamsters and other smaller rodents though!",bunny rabbit central,1
"I purchased this pen because we were getting a Maltese puppy and wanted a small but not too small place for her during the day. This pen is the perfect size, you can't beat the price and the set up is so easy.",dogs,3
I have an Italian Greyhound that likes to find the seam in a carpet and pull it so she unravels the carpet. I got this hoping I could spray areas and she would leave it alone. I have light colored carpet and I didn't want to have to put chili pepper all over. Well she didn't like the smell in the bottle so I thought that was promising but when I sprayed it she didn't care and kept pulling at the carpet. When you read the bottle is sounds more like it is to keep them from licking them selves.,dogs,3
"I have had Samoyed Dogs since the mid 80's...I am forturnate that I have had the privilage of some of them to live a long full life. I have used many different joint/hip supplements over the years but Arthisoothe has made a different in my Seniors' quality of life. Our unusal cold Texas winter has not slowed him down, if anything he has enjoyed romping in the cold. Pretty Amazing for a 14yrs old large dog! Sincerely, Linda-Ruth",dogs,3
"We started with one...got a second one and this is the third...for whatever reason our dogs like drinking out of this style dog water bowl best, and we like it becase it doesn't spill! Works great in a moving vehicle and holds alot of water for in the home. One thing - make sure that you SECURELY screw the top in, because if it is not done very tightly, it will leak. Other than that, it is wonderful and works better than any bowl we have tried!",dogs,3
"Neither one of my dogs were very enthusiastic about these. My bigger shar pei ate them, but she will eat anything. My friends pit didn't like them and neither did my smaller shar pei",dogs,3
"Overall a great lid kit. Good bright lights, strong filter pump, and quite operation. Sometimes late at night the filter sounds like it's raining outside, which is nice. After I've stirred up the debris by remodeling my freshwater community 30 gal tank, this filter will clear the water in a very short time...highly effective for removing fine and coarse debris. The intake is broad enough that none of my fish get stuck as they swim by...lol. The plastic lid is a little flimsy, but if you take care of it, you won't break it.I also have to add that a few days or so after I got the tank set up, the light quite working...bad ballast. I was upset at the thought of all the hassle it would probably take to deal with getting it repaired/replaced by the manufacturer, but I was happily surprised that Marineland customer service was very nice, trusted me, didn't ask any questions, and just sent me a whole new component to replace the broken kit, and told me I could just keep the broken one...I got the replacement two days after I called. I'm a Marineland customer forever.",fish aquatic pets,4
"The bell falls of easily all the cats that I got a collar for managed to lose the bell somehow within 24 hrs of putting the collar on. The glo-in the dark feature was great for our short haired feline crew, but on our long haired the collar disappeared under his mane, although little patches of the neon shone through the hair in the dark it was not enough for a safety feature, fortuately the cat in question rarely wanders out after dark.",cats,2
Our 3 cats love this high quality post. It's simply the best! P.S.- Don't waste your money on the overpriced perch accessory; all you need is the post.,cats,2
Wanted something I could feed my inside cats once in a while and not have to change for feral cats. The feral cats ate less and their coats looked healthy within weeks. Big improvement--so in the end it cost less and was better for them.,cats,2
"I did a lot of research before I ordered this. I didn't want to get anything that would hurt my dog (choke harness, prong collar) so this seemed like the best choice.I put it on my 86 pound Pit and it doesn't fit him well and it did NOT stop his pulling.The way it's supposed to work is by appyling pressure to the chest and therefore discourage pulling. My dog doesn't even feel the pressure so this defeats the whole purpose.He is a very muscular dog",dogs,3
"My bull terrier Leonidas loves planet dog products. I love baseball, opening day was just a few weeks away. Well Leo had a large chunk of the white layer ripped off and swallowed on opening day. World series champion cards vs marlins. Since then I have removed the white layer and he still loves it. It's a durable product for sure.",dogs,3
I recieved this product fast within few days and My cat really likes it and stop using the furniture and what not.,cats,2
